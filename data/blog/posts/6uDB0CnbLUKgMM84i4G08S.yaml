:title: Why you need the right tool for the job
:content: |-
  I got married in 2013. Then I bought a power drill -- a cheap one. I’ve spent a total of five hours assembling flat pack furniture in the last four weeks alone and I’m salty about it.

  First it was a play kitchen (from Ikea) for my two year old daughter built while my wife was in labour with our second because we wanted her to have a gift “from” her new brother. Then, it was heavy outdoor furniture with sharp hex (Allen) keys and stripped bolts that left me with bloody knuckles.

  I counted 14 (14!) hex keys in my toolbox, equating to three and a half flat pack nightmares per year and 35 hours of work since getting married. I didn’t buy those hex keys. They only come from [one place](https://www.ikea.com).

  Looking back on it, I should have bought the right tool years ago. A decent drill that charged quickly, had the right size bits, and enough power to get the job done would have saved me time and aggravation.

  ## The wrong tools for the job

  Recently we’ve seen Google announce that they’re shutting down the [Google Finance portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/4-ways-sharesight-is-better-than-google-finance/) feature. This will leave millions of investors in the lurch because they relied on a portfolio watchlist built by a company with no interest in maintaining it.

  Yahoo! Finance for their part announced that they’re [entering the online broking space](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/investors-can-now-make-trades-on-yahoo-finance/). Will this mean that the Yahoo Finance portfolio tracker will only become available to users who trade through Yahoo’s broker partners? Who’s to know, but I guarantee changes are on the way.

  Not only can’t you trust these services will be around for the long term, they [can downright mislead investors](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/yahoo-finance-vs-sharesight--comparing-portfolio-trackers/) about their portfolio performance. Even your online broker will often provide you with [misleading performance figures](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/) -- not because they can’t provide you the right figures, but because they don’t generate revenue from doing so.
