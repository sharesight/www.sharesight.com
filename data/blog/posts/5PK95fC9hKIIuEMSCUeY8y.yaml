:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not

  -- and whether you complete your own return or work with an [accountant](/partners/accountants/)

  Read on to learn how.\n\n![Record keeping requirements ATO Australian investors](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2H979dhM5l0GfDgihPJqcE/05897b722227fbef8fb8e0e514b282e5/Record_keeping_requirements_ATO_Australian_investors.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  The ATO's record-keeping requirements for investors\n\nThe Australian Taxation Office
  (ATO) is very clear in terms of the [records investors are required to keep](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investing/In-detail/Investing-in-shares/Shares---helping-you-to-avoid-common-mistakes/?page=10#Records_you_need_to_keep).\n\n|
  The records you must keep | How long you must keep them |\n| ---------- | ----------
  |\n| <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Your 'buy' and 'sell' statements</span><br>(also
  known as *trade confirmations* or *contract notes*) | Keep these records for 5 years
  from the date you dispose of your shares |\n| <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Your
  dividend statements</span> | Keep these records for 5 years from 31 October or,
  if you lodge later, for 5 years from the date you lodge your tax return |\n\n**You
  will receive most of the records you need to keep from:**\n\n- The company that
  issued the shares\n- Your stockbroker or online share trading provider\n- Your financial
  institution, if you took out a loan to buy the shares\n\nNo matter how organised
  you are, that’s a lot of paperwork to keep track of and share with your accountant
  when tax time rolls around. Thankfully [Sharesight](/) automates most day-to-day
  portfolio activities, and allows you to easily store and organise your portfolio-related
  paperwork.\n\n## Investor record keeping for the ATO using Sharesight\n\nKeeping
  accurate investor records as part of your ATO compliance is easy with Sharesight.
  To get started, simply [sign-up for a FREE Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  and [add your holdings](https://help.sharesight.com/adding-your-investments-into-sharesight/).
  From there you can:\n\n### #1 -- Record all your 'buy' and 'sell' statements from
  your broker\n\nRecording all of your investment trading activity is easy with Sharesight,
  simply attach your official trade confirmation statements to the trade records within
  your Sharesight portfolio:\n\n![Contract note attachment (VGS) - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2kCX97QKXt8EjkFbKTdIxF/fe0f7890928434dec07caaa0c13ef1d9/contract-note-attachment-vgs_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nYou
  can further automate this step by arranging for your broker to [email your trade
  confirmations to your portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  or automatically forwarding these emails to Sharesight. This allows your ongoing
  trades to be automatically recorded in real-time -- with the appropriate contract
  note attached to each trade.\n\nTIP: To see a list of all your trades, simply run
  the [All Trades Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/view-and-export-your-trading-history-with-the-all-trades-report/).
  You may run the report over any period, and even download it as a .csv, .pdf, or
  [Google Sheet](/blog/new-open-sharesight-reports-directly-google-sheets/):\n\n![Sharesight
  All Trades Report - AU 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3d7YSrtwAvqtT5pCyU5K9a/94d7c125ee84308564a8aefe30056f24/sharesight-all-trades-report-au-2019.png?w=950)\n\n###
  #2 -- Record your dividend income statements\n\nWhen you add a trade to Sharesight,
  the system will automatically backfill past dividends (and continue to add new ones
  as they are announced). You have the ability to edit any of the suggested data,
  and attach your official dividend statements to the respective dividend entry. This
  ensures that all your dividend records are safely stored and organised in one place
  (instead of across your email, filing cabinet, shoe box, etc):\n\n![dividend statement

  To see a running list of all the dividends you've ever received, simply run the
  [Taxable Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report/).
  You may run the report over any period, and even download it as a .csv, .pdf, or
  [Google Sheet](/blog/new-open-sharesight-reports-directly-google-sheets/):\n\n![Sharesight
  Taxable Income Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/uHhoMRSqTp7rNe6CcNNLx/e03bcd81e9dbf270efd9121f0b129ddd/Sharesight_Taxable_Income_Report.png?w=950)\n\n###
  #3 -- Track the impact of dividend reinvestments on your investment cost base\n[As
  per the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investing/In-detail/Investing-in-shares/Shares---helping-you-to-avoid-common-mistakes/?page=10#H1),
  if you opt into a dividend reinvestment plan (DRP), *“you must pay tax on your reinvested
  dividends. The amount of the dividend received will form part of the cost base of
  the shares you receive. Keep a record of your reinvested dividends to help you work
  out any capital gains or capital losses you make when you dispose of the shares.”*\n\nSharesight’s
  [dividend reinvestment](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/) feature
  allows you to activate a DRP for a particular holding and automatically track the
  reinvested dividends. Alternatively, you may manually reinvest a specific dividend,
  at the correct reinvestment price. Either way, you’ll have a complete record of
  all reinvested dividends, as well as their tax implications:\n\n![DRP settings -

  #4 -- Share your records with your accountant\n\nMaking sure all your records are
  correct is a great start, but when it comes to filing your taxes most investors
  use an accountant. Fortunately Sharesight also lets you easily [share secure portfolio
  access](/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/) with
  anyone you wish. So no matter whether an accountant or family member files your
  taxes, they’ll have everything they need in one place. No more paper chasing, overflowing
