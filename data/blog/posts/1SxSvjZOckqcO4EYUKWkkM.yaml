:title: Takeaways from Livewire Live 2018
:content: "Yesterday the [Sharesight](/) team dropped in at [Livewire Live](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/save-the-date-livewire-live-2018-is-coming),
  hosted by Bell Direct and ASX. Livewire Live is now in its fourth year, the panelists
  were top notch and the auditorium packed. If you're an Australian investor, have
  exposure to Australia, or are curious to see the world from an Australian investor's
  standpoint, Livewire Live is a great event to put on your calendar.\n\n![Livewire

  year's panel discussions focused on:\n\n1. __MACROECONOMICS__ &mdash; \"The big
  changes in global macro right now\"\n2. __STRATEGY__ &mdash; \"Time to think beyond
  the index in Australian equities\"\n3. __EQUITIES__ &mdash; \"The smart money in
  global equities\"\n\nAnd the lineup was packed with well-known fund managers:\n\n-
  Charlie Aitken, Chief Investment Officer, Aitken Investment Management\n- Charlie
  Jamieson, Executive Director, Jamieson Coote Bonds\n- Vimal Gor, Head of Income
  and Fixed Interest, Pendal Group\n- Peter Cooper, Chief Investment Officer, Cooper
  Investors\n- Paul Moore, Chief Investment Officer, PM Capital\n- Nick Griffin, Chief
  Investment Officer, Munro Partners\n- Matthew Kidman, Centennial Asset Management
  \n- Catherine Allfrey, Principal & Portfolio Manager, Wavestone Capital\n- Anthony
  Aboud, Portfolio Manager, Perpetual\n- Ben Griffiths, Portfolio Manager, Eley Griffiths
  Group\n- Catherine Yeung, Investment Director, Fidelity International\n- Adrian
  Warner, Chief Investment Officer, Avenir Capital\n- Simon Shields, Portfolio Manager,
  Monash Investors\n- Steve Johnson, Chief Investment Officer, Forager Funds\n- Chris
  Stott, Chief Investment Officer, Wilson Asset Management\n- Chris Bedingfield, Portfolio
  Manager, Quay Global Investors\n\n![Livewire Live 2018 Equities](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5yRdrLBg7my2AcQwQYSUII/68679247a65b5e625b2cb5ec48ba4bcc/Livewire_Live_2018_Equities.jpg?w=950)\n\nOverall
  the outlook presented was more bearish than in previous years, with the exception
  of China which was seen by many as the exception. A recap on our blog won't do justice
  to the panel discussions and audience Q&A, so head over to the Livewire site as
  they’ve written up two standout presentations from the event.\n\n**Here are some
  key takeaways that caught my attention:** \n\n> It's the most exciting time in human
  history to be an investor.\n\n> The best opportunities exist today where technology
  and population growth collide.\n\n> Use Australian equities for income, and global
  equities for growth.\n\n> Domino’s Pizza is not a tech stock.\n\n> The future lies
  directly to our north - Asia is the best investment theme to invest in over the
  coming years.\n\n> We’ve had nearly 10 years of artificial liquidity and it’s painted
  over the cracks.\n\n> We’ve already had 5 observable crises this year and it’s only
  June.\n\n> Liquidity is something that investors need to think about -- because
  it can evaporate very quickly.\n\n>  Is Trump going to be concerned that the rest
  of the world is slowing but the USA is growing? Probably not.\n\n> We don't expect
  any rate moves until 2020 -- when it’s just as likely to be a cut as a hike.\n\n>
  The one thing we do not need is a housing correction -- were house prices to start
  accelerating on the down side (and the RBA not to do anything) we could have the
  mother of all recessions.\n\n> Markets have done well and the risk reward has changed
  -- whatever your tolerance level was, it should be reduced.\n\n> Going forward,
  expect lower returns out of long-term index funds -- whether we are going up or
  down or sideways as liquidity comes out of the system.\n\n> Australia peaked in
  2015. 98% of the opportunities are around the rest of the world -- being offshore
  is going to be a better risk reward for a very long time.\n\n> What has been the
  most crowded asset class over the last 20 years is ETFs -- the next crisis could
  be the liquidity issues from ETFs.\n\n> Gold: you can’t eat it, it doesn’t pay dividends,
  but you should have some sympathy for it as a store of value.\n\n> In a place like
  China you cannot ignore policy direction.\n\n> There’s nothing like a long strong
  bull market to spike interest in passive investing.\n\n### Get Livewire insights
