  Check out [our contribution to the year end bumper edition of the ASX Newsletter](https://www.asx.com.au/education/investor-update-newsletter/201412-more-choice-for-investors.htm). [Sharesight](/) Executive Director Andrew Bird comments on how technology is coming to the rescue for investors looking for choice. While self-managed super and investor-friendly securities such as ETFs and [mFunds](/blog/asx-mfund-now-available-on-sharesight/) have helped unpack the bank-owned, vertically integrated bundle, it's connected applications that are making this a reality.

  We're excited and honoured to be featured by an institution of ASX's calibre. Very happy to see that the top end of town is beginning to recognise that fintech firms are for real.
