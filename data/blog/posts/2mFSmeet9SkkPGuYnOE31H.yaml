:title: Is it time to consider a defensive investment strategy?
:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only
  and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice
  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant
  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nBuying growth assets and holding
  them for the long term might generally be sound advice, but there are times in every
  investor’s life when they seriously consider switching to a defensive investment
  strategy – especially if they’re at or near retirement age.\n\n \n\nThere’s no shortage
  of concerning news around at the moment, so some investors might wonder if now is,
  indeed, a good time to go on the defensive.\n\n \n\nHistorically, investors have
  done well when they’ve accumulated a diversified portfolio of equities and then
  hung on for the long term – because despite regular bear markets, history shows
  that the world’s major stock markets have experienced far more ups than downs. In
  other words, they’ve averaged year-on-year growth.\n\n \n\nBut long-term averages
  are cold comfort if you’ve left the workforce and your portfolio of growth assets
  suddenly falls 25%. Your wealth may never recover. With the benefit of hindsight,
  you might wish that you’d switched from a growth strategy (trying to build your
  wealth) to a defensive strategy (trying to protect your wealth).\n\n \n\nEven the
  world’s greatest growth investor, Warren Buffett, believes there are times when
  it’s better to be cautious. To quote his famous two rules of investing: \"Rule number
  one: never lose money. Rule number two: never forget rule number one.\"\n\n![defensive
  investment strategy](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5cs2pN1KKiyXZ702tOxcAi/a7568b515aabee53d08251ac04646960/defensive_investment_strategy.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  The case for the defence\n\n \n\nSome investors are permanently bullish. They argue
  that history is on their side; that the go-for-growth strategy always prevails over
  the long term. Fair enough.\n\n \n\nBut if you’re a [bearish investor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment),
  you don’t have to look too hard right now to find evidence to support your case:\n\n
  \n\n●      **Trade tensions –** the trade war between the US and China is not only
  rumbling on, [it’s actually escalating](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-26/asx-tumbles-after-us-china-trade-war-escalates/11447342),
  placing downwards pressure on economic growth in both countries. If the world’s
  two biggest economies sneeze, the global economy is likely to catch a cold.\n\n
  \n\n●      **Inverted yield curve –** yields on 10-year US government bonds have
  recently[ fallen below yields for two-year Treasuries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2019/08/14/the-yield-curve-has-inverted-and-you-should-sell-your-stocks/).
  That is a danger sign, because in past recessions, yields for long-term bonds have
  also dipped below yields for short-term bonds. (That said, while recent recessions
  have always featured ‘inverted’ yield curves, inverted yield curves haven’t always
  prefigured recessions.)\n\n \n\n●      **Brexit –** a no-deal Brexit [looks increasingly
  likely](https://www.bbc.com/news/49465298), which could devastate the UK economy
  (the sixth-largest in the world) and also damage the EU economy (the world’s third-largest).\n\n
  \n\n## What is a defensive investment strategy?\n\n \n\nSo it makes sense why some
  investors might be considering switching from a growth to a [defensive investment
  strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defensiveinvestmentstrategy.asp).\n\n
  \n\nBut what, exactly, do those terms mean?\n\n \n\nA growth investor might have,
  say, 70% of their funds in growth assets and 30% in defensive assets, while a defensive
  investor might choose a 30/70 split (click here for [example weightings for different
  investment strategies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-build-a-long-term-portfolio-in-listed-markets/)).\n\n
  \n\nGrowth assets include stocks, property, REITs and alternative investments –
  assets that can quickly rise and fall in value. Defensive assets, by contrast, tend
  to be income producing investments with lower volatility such as bonds, term deposits,
  gold and ‘defensive stocks’ (such as utilities).\n\n \n\nA defensive investment
  strategy is more about minimising (or avoiding) losses than maximising gains. That’s
  why it may suit investors who are at or near retirement age, or younger investors
  who might be planning to liquidate their portfolio in the near future so they can
  buy a property, start a business or fund a wedding.\n\n \n\n## Benjamin Graham’s
  four rules for defensive stock selection\n\n \n\nBefore there was Buffett, there
  was Benjamin.\n\n \n\nBenjamin Graham, also known as the ‘father of value investing’,
  was a legendary professor and investor who taught and later employed the young Buffett.
  Graham was also an author: he wrote *[The Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.com.au/Intelligent-Investor-Benjamin-Graham/dp/0060555661)*,
  which Buffett calls \"the best book about investing ever written\".\n\n \n\nIn *The
  Intelligent Investor*, Graham advises defensive investors to \"purchase only high-grade
  bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks\". This should be done through[
  dollar-cost averaging](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/),
  he says.\n\n \n\nGraham also offers four rules to follow when choosing defensive
  stocks:\n\n \n\n●      Build a portfolio of 10-30 diversified stocks\n\n●      Choose
  companies that are \"large, prominent, and conservatively financed\"\n\n●      Choose
  companies with \"a long record of continuous dividend payments\"\n\n●      Pay no
  more than 25 times average earnings over the past seven years, and no more than
  20 times average earnings over the past 12 months\n\n \n\n## Stay on top of your
  investment strategy with Sharesight\n\n \n\nSharesight has made it easy for investors
  to heed Graham’s advice about building a defensive portfolio.\n\n![Diversity Report
