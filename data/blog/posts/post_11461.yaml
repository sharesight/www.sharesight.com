:content: "_Every week we post a tip that we hope will help you become a successful
  share market investor._ \n\n**Tip #9 &mdash; Diversification**\n\nWhen it comes
  to investing, diversification is important for two reasons: it can potentially protect
  you against undue losses if investments in a particular company, sector or asset
  class fail, and it can actually improve the overall return of your portfolio. For
  these reasons it has been described as [the only free lunch in investing](/blog/portfolio-diversification-what-does-it-mean-to-you/)
  but it is important not to go overboard. Diversification does not guarantee success
  and if itâ€™s overdone it adds complexity and has the potential to [dilute rather
  than improve returns](/blog/diversify-or-bust/).\n\n<small>*This information is
  not a recommendation nor a statement of opinion. You should consult an independent
  financial adviser before making any decisions with respect to your shares in relation
