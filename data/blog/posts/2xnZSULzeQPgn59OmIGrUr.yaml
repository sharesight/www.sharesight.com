:content: "If you’ve ever invested in preferred shares, you may have come across the
  term \"cumulative dividend\". This is a type of dividend eligible to some holders
  of preferred shares, which is paid under different conditions than a common dividend.
  To learn more about how cumulative dividends work, the pros and cons of receiving
  cumulative dividends and how to keep track of them using Sharesight, keep reading.
  \n\n![What is a cumulative dividend](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4NzsTmByJ5cQCpvliJOqUZ/5d31496ebe84deca17311f2d6c3b23a6/What_is_a_cumulative_dividend_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a cumulative dividend? \n\nA cumulative dividend is a financial benefit
  attached to certain preferred shares. It guarantees investors that a certain fixed
  amount or percentage of the share’s par value will be paid out as a periodic dividend
  independent of company performance. \n\nUnlike non-cumulative dividends, which the
  company can elect to halt at any time, cumulative dividends must be paid out to
  shareholders. This guarantees investors an extra degree of security in what might
  otherwise be a risky or less profitable investment.\n\n## How does a cumulative
  dividend work? \n\nA cumulative dividend is essentially the mandatory interest that
  a company pays on its preferred shareholders’ capital. In return for financing the
  company, preferred shareholders are guaranteed set cumulative dividends which are
  paid to them periodically – even if the company isn’t operating at a profit. \n\nNote
  that cumulative dividends are only attached to preferred shares (shares that have
  priority over common shares when dividends are being issued). Common shares generally
  have no right to cumulative dividends. \n\nBecause cumulative dividends are a binding
  obligation, a company must pay them out before distributing common dividends to
  the rest of their shareholders. If a company cannot afford to pay its cumulative
  dividends on time, it must halt payments to all shareholders while it sources the
  capital necessary to clear the debt. During that time, unpaid cumulative dividends
  must also be announced in financial statements.\n\n## How do you calculate cumulative
  dividends?\n\nIn order to [calculate a stock’s cumulative dividend per share](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/how-to-calculate-cumulative-dividends-per-share.aspx),
  there are a few simple steps. \n\nFirst, you will need to determine the stock’s
  **annual dividend payment** using the following formula: *Annual dividend = dividend
  rate x par value.* \n\n**Note**: The **dividend rate** is generally an agreed percentage
  of the share’s par value. In some cases, however, it may be a fixed amount. This
  depends on the specifics of the obligation. The **par value** is the face value
  of the share, which is the value of the share as listed in the corporate charter,
  rather than the market value. \n\nNext, you can find the stock’s **quarterly dividend
  payment** by using the following formula: *Quarterly dividend = annual dividend
  / 4*.\n\nAfter this, you will need to determine the number of quarterly preferred
  dividend payments the company has missed, which can be found in the company’s financial
  reports. \n\nTo calculate the **cumulative dividend per share**, simply multiply
  the number of missed quarterly preferred dividend payments by the quarterly dividend
  payment amount. In summation: *Cumulative dividend per share = missed quarterly
  preferred dividend payments x quarterly dividend payment.* \n\n## What are cumulative
  preferred shares?\n\nIf you want the benefits of cumulative dividends, you will
  need to invest in cumulative preferred shares first. This is a type of preferred
  share that guarantees the back-payment of withheld or halted dividends. \n\nThis
  differs from non-cumulative preferred shares, where shareholders have no right to
  claim dividends they missed out on in the past. If the company is in financial trouble
  or chooses to withhold dividends, shareholders simply have to go without. \n\nAs
  a cumulative preference shareholder, however, you effectively receive an IOU on
  any dividends that go unpaid. What’s more, the company must settle all cumulative
  dividends before they can pay their common shareholders. \n\n## Benefits of cumulative
  dividends \n\n### Guaranteed returns\n\nCumulative dividends are guaranteed regardless
  of company performance, meaning they could be a stable source of investment return
  in the long run. \n\n### Risk management\n\nIf you’re investing in a volatile market
  or financially unstable company, cumulative dividends will minimise your risk exposure.
  Even if it performs poorly, you will still see an investment return.\n\n### Priority
  access to common equity\n\nShareholders of cumulative preferred stocks have first
  access to common equity if the business is liquidated. That means you’ve got a higher
  chance of recouping your investment if the business becomes insolvent.\n\n## Disadvantages
  of cumulative dividends\n\n### Limited returns\n\nThe fixed nature of cumulative
  dividends means they don’t grow with business profitability. If the company reports
  increased earnings that result in bigger payouts for common shareholders, cumulative
  dividends remain the same.\n\n### Lower payment rate\n\nDue to their reduced risk,
  cumulative dividends tend to pay less than non-cumulative dividends. \n\n### No
  voting rights\n\nWhile cumulative preferred shares are technically classed as equity,
  their holders are treated more like creditors. Generally, they have limited or no
  voting rights in the business.\n\n## Example of cumulative dividends in action\n\nDaybreak
  Systems, a computer hardware company, issues a cumulative preferred share with a
  [par value](https://efinancemanagement.com/investment-decisions/par-value) of $100
  and an annual dividend rate of 5% ($5 per share each year).\n\nRhiannon, an investor,
  purchases 100 of these shares – guaranteeing her a total of $500 in cumulative dividends
  each year regardless of company performance.\n\nHowever, Daybreak experiences financial
  difficulties that year and opts to pay half of the dividend only. This means Rhiannon
  only receives $250, with the other $250 in arrears. \n\nThings worsen in the year
  following, and Daybreak can no longer afford to pay the dividend at all. Rhiannon
  is now owed a total of $750 ($250 from the previous year, plus the full $500 dividend
  from this year). \n\nThings turn around once Daybreak releases a new product a year
  later. With improved earnings, the company can now pay its cumulative preferred
  shareholders. Rhiannon receives:\n\n* The $750 in arrears from the previous two
  years\n\n* $500 for the current year\n\nOnce Daybreak clears its debts with all
  cumulative preferred shareholders, it can choose whether or not to issue dividends
  to its common shareholders.\n\n## Looking for an easy way to track your dividends?\n\nWhen
  you have cumulative dividends owed, reinvested dividends to track, and years’ worth
  of financial data to compare, even the most careful spreadsheet starts to crack
  under pressure.\n\nBut there’s an easier way to track your dividends. Sharesight’s
