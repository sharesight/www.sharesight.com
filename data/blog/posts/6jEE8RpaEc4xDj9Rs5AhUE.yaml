  2021: The Foreign Investment Fund Income report for the 2020-2021 tax year is now
  available in Sharesight with our final FIF list.\n\nAs a New Zealand based company,
  [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com) was built with the needs of Kiwi investors
  in mind from day one. Beyond using it to track prices and dividends for shares listed
  on the NZX (and at least 30 [global share markets](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)),
  NZ investors also rely on Sharesight’s portfolio tax reports, which are designed
  according to IRD rules.\n\nOne such rule involves foreign investment fund (FIF)
  income, which applies to New Zealand residents with certain offshore holdings, such
  as foreign shares and managed funds. In certain cases, there are special tax implications
  for investors who hold these investments.\n\nRead on to learn:\n\n* [What is a foreign

  What is a foreign investment fund (FIF)?\n\nAs stated by the New Zealand Inland
  Revenue Department (IRD), a foreign investment fund (FIF) is an offshore investment
  held by a New Zealand-resident taxpayer who holds:\n\n* less than 10% of the shares
  in a foreign company\n\n* less than 10% of the units in a foreign unit trust\n\n*
  between 10% and 40% of the shares in a foreign company which is not a CFC\n\n* an
  interest in a life insurance policy where a FIF is the insurer and the policy is
  not offered or entered into in New Zealand\n\n* an interest in a foreign superannuation
  scheme\n\nIt does not include interest earned from term deposits, bonds, debentures
  or money lent.\n\n## Changes to FIF income rules\n\nBefore we go any further, here’s
  a bit of background information:\n\n* In previous years, the IRD published an Australian
  share exemption lists – also known as the IR871\n\n* The list indicated whether
  an Australian company listed on the ASX (excluding listed investment companies)
  was exempt from the FIF rules for that financial year\n\n* The IRD enacted changes
  from 1 April 2017 to simplify the exemptions list\n\n* The key change is basically
  the removal of any reference to an approved index and instead the company simply
  has to be on the official list of ASX limited (other rules still apply)\n\n* These
  changes take effect for the 2017-2018 tax year and beyond\n\n## How to use Sharesight
  to determine whether you have FIF income (and if so, how much)\n\nAs a result of
  these IRD rules, investors who have certain types of overseas investments may have
  earned FIF income. And while the IRD has an online tool that lets you check if you
  are required to do anything under the FIF rules, if you determine that you do, the
  actual calculations can get quite complicated.\n\nThe good news is that investors
  on a [Sharesight NZ Expert](https://www.sharesight.com/pricing/) or [Sharesight
  NZ Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/) plan can run their own FIF Report in just
  a few clicks. Here’s how to do it:\n\n### 1 – Determine whether any of your holdings
  are subject to FIF\n\nSharesight automatically flags any holdings within your portfolio
  which are subject to FIF rules:\n\n![sharesight fif-report-2020-1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3GKetJifRuc1I1tMuBWbUs/f8e70c0963d21fbb4ebf15514b8bf5b3/sharesight_fif-report-2020-1.png?w=950)\n\n######
  We recommend double-checking your FIF-included companies against the IRD’s Australian
  share exemption list. If you notice any holdings that are not automatically included/excluded
  by Sharesight, please reach out to Sharesight support and we will rectify any issues.\n\n###
  2 – Calculate your FIF threshold amount\n\nSharesight determines whether you exceed
  the FIF threshold amount (generally $50,000 for individuals). Based on the example
  above, the answer is \"yes\" because the peak balance is $172,551.69.\n\n### 3 –
  Calculate your claimable tax\n\nIf you exceed the FIF threshold, clicking the \"Calculate\"
  button will automatically calculate your FIF income:\n\n![sharesight fif-report-2020-2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/14TeHknfARc2GF8ANtvxCi/9aa5b3297530cac56a113aab7ce61fae/sharesight_fif-report-2020-2.png?w=950)\n\nSharesight
  automatically calculates your FIF income using both the *Fair Dividend Rate Method*
  and *Comparative Value Method*. In most cases an individual or family trust is permitted
  to use the lower of the two income calculation methods to report their taxable income
  in a given tax year.\n\nFor more information on how Sharesight calculates these,
  see:\n\n* Sharesight FIF Report [Fair Dividend Rate Method](https://help.sharesight.com/fdr_income_fif_reports_page/)
  help page\n\n* Sharesight FIF Report [Comparative Value Method](https://help.sharesight.com/cv_method_fif_reports_page/)
  help page\n\nUltimately the total claimable overseas tax paid (combining both the
  value from the non FIF overseas tax paid amount and FIF total claimable overseas
  tax paid amount) can be entered into the NZ IR3 income tax return at field 17A and
  can be used to offset the income tax payable.\n\n## How to calculate your FIF tax

  report\n\n> I used the FIF reports for the first time and it greatly assisted the
  preparation of 2013/14 years tax returns. Sent copies of report to IRD with the
  returns and it was no problem. Well done Sharesight and well worth upgrading to
  include this reporting facility.<br><cite>RICHARD MADDREN -- SHARESIGHT CLIENT SINCE
  2008</cite>\n\n> We have been using Sharesight for several years. It makes it easy
  to review portfolio performance, keep track of income and manage those awful FIF
  calculations at tax time. The subscription is easily recovered in time savings at
  year end...<br><cite>MARGARET HOLMES -- SHARESIGHT CLIENT SINCE 2010</cite>\n\n##
