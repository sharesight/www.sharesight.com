:title: Sharesight + myprosperity webinar
:content: "Last week, [Sharesight](/) joined forces with our newest integration partner,
  [myprosperity](/partners/myprosperity/), to present our first joint webinar on the
  21st century financial experience. [Doug Morris](https://twitter.com/Doug_Sharesight/)
  (CEO, Sharesight) and [Chris Ridd](https://twitter.com/chris_ridd) (CEO, myprosperity)
  discussed the driving forces that are shaping the financial landscape and touched
  on key topics, including:\n\n- Demand for a 21st century financial experience\n-
  The rise of self-directed investing\n- Proliferation of retail-friendly products
  like ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and LICs (Listed Investment Companies)\n- Pressure
  on dealer groups and the rise of fee-for-service models/IFAs\n\nWith the [Royal
  Commission](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/road-ahead-from-banking-royal-commission/)
  putting a spotlight on the financial advice industry, and the arrival of robo-advice
  and DIY models, there is more pressure than ever on advisers to re-think their fee-structures.
  The ‘new breed’ of financial adviser will need to stay on the front foot, embracing
  a balanced combination of traditional and DIY models. \n\n## Watch the Sharesight
