:content: "With Sharesight, investors can easily track stocks and ETFs on the Nasdaq
  exchange, with price and performance updates on a [15 minute delayed basis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/).
  This is in addition to Sharesight's support for other US markets such as the [New
  York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-the-new-york-stock-exchange-nyse-with-sharesight/),
  [NYSE American (AMEX)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/),
  NYSE ARCA and [BATS Exchange (BATS)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bats-markets-bzx-listed-stocks-with-sharesight/),
  along with more than [40 other major global markets](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  This allows investors to track *all of their investments in one place*, while taking
  advantage of Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n![finalnasdaq](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3j29j4zSpYmgKrDiUDhWER/6ddedf8fd426c3f46d799979b26c1a2d/finalnasdaq.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is the Nasdaq? \n\nThe [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) is a US stock exchange
  that was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD).
  The world’s first electronic stock market, today the Nasdaq exchange is also the
  second-largest stock exchange by market capitalisation. It includes some of the
  world’s biggest technology companies, most notably FAANG: Facebook, Amazon, Apple,
  Netflix and Alphabet (Google). \n\n## Why should investors track their Nasdaq stocks
  with Sharesight?\n\nBy tracking your Nasdaq stocks with Sharesight, you can easily
  [monitor your investment price and performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  across multiple brokers and asset classes – benefiting from Sharesight's [15 minute
  delayed pricing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/)
  for the Nasdaq – or take advantage of Sharesight’s advanced performance and tax
  reporting designed for the needs of self-directed investors. Superior to the data
  provided by most brokers, Sharesight gives investors a true picture of their investment
  performance by taking into account the impact of brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/),
  [foreign exchange rates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  and capital gains when calculating their returns. \n\n### Track dividends from Nasdaq
  stocks\n\nUnlike other portfolio trackers, Sharesight automatically tracks dividend
  and distribution income and includes this when calculating your investment return.
  In the screenshot below for example, dividends make a significant contribution to
  this stock’s returns, highlighting why your portfolio tracking solution needs to
  consider more than just capital gains when calculating performance. \n\n![image

  Powerful performance reports built for investors\n\nFor investors looking to do
  a deep dive into specific aspects of their portfolio performance, Sharesight offers
  a range of powerful reports including [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/), [Contribution
  Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  and [Future Income](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/) (upcoming dividends).
  \n\nPictured below is an example of the Diversity Report being used to assess a
  portfolio’s diversity based on market. This would be particularly useful for investors
  looking to evaluate the performance of their Nasdaq stocks compared to the rest
  of their portfolio, for instance. \n\n![image 2 nasdaq](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7pNFNpTfJNtQV57mcxhNhk/727696cb0542e88eb2226af29b0e35d5/image_2_nasdaq.png?w=950)\n\n##
