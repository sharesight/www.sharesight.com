:title: What is Risk Diversification?
:url_slug: diversification-risk-return
:content: "Risk diversification is the process of investing across a range of industries
  and categories within one portfolio. This ensures that even if some assets perform
  poorly, other areas of the portfolio associated with different sectors can cover
  the loss. \n\nEssentially, it’s a way for investors to ensure they don’t have all
  their eggs stored in one basket. For this reason, diversification can allow investors
  to reach their long-term financial goals without being overexposed to risk. \n\n![What
  is risk diversification](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3rM52mn8BZrkWFrl2IdGdq/ac035c005d051ca15fe3ca535eb250d8/What_is_risk_diversification.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What are the risks associated with investing?\n\nThere are two types of risks that
  may impact your investments: specific risks and market risks.\n\n### Specific risks\n\nSpecific
  risks apply to a particular industry, investment or company, affecting the value
  of any associated assets. If you only invested in computer or tech stocks, for example,
  and there was a shortage in raw silicon, this would be a specific risk that would
  affect your entire investment portfolio. \n\n### Market risks\n\nMarket risks (also
  known as volatility) are possible losses caused by factors that affect the entire
  market, such as wars and political conflict, stock price movements, and interest
  rate changes. You cannot diversify these risks, but you can hedge them by investing
  across various financial instruments.\n\n## How does diversification help reduce
  risk in investing?\n\nHolding a wide variety of investments in your portfolio minimises
  the risk of a drastic loss by:\n\n1. **Giving your portfolio more stability**. Risk
  and return diversification can allow the positive performance of your good investments
  to offset the negative performance of others. \n\n2. **Hedging your bets**. Ensuring
  your investments are spread out over industries and sectors means you are less vulnerable
  to specific risks. If you own stocks in diverse industries such as banking, healthcare
  and agriculture, for instance, an event that affects one of those industries only
  affects the stock you hold from that particular industry. For example, during a
  drought, only your agricultural stock would perform negatively, while the rest of
  your portfolio could continue to do well. The less correlated your investments are,
  the better. \n\n3. **Diversifying across asset classes**. By investing in a broad
  range of assets (e.g. bonds, stocks, real estate), you reduce the volatility and
  risk to your portfolio by holding investments that have a low correlation to one
  another.\n\n## Does risk diversification increase returns?\n\nWhile risk diversification
  doesn’t necessarily increase the expected returns of your portfolio, it minimises
  the risks you face and ensures no single investment can impact you dramatically.
  \n\nWhen you have invested in a range of assets and asset classes, you can never
  do worse than your worst stock or better than your best stock. The ups and downs
  of your different assets will balance each other out, smoothing out the returns
  on your investments. \n\n## What is the relationship between risk and return?\n\nTo
  start, let’s outline simple definitions of both risk and return. \n\n*Return* is
  the money you anticipate making on your investment. This is often based on historical
  returns and is usually part of the reason you invest in an asset.\n\n*Risk* is the
  possibility that you could lose money on your investment. It can be measured as
  the difference between the actual return you receive on an investment and how much
  this differs from your expected return. \n\nRisk and return are positively correlated.
  The greater the risk, the greater the chance of making a profit or loss. According
  to the risk-reward tradeoff principle, lower risk is generally associated with lower
  returns and higher risk, with higher returns.\n\n## Can diversification eliminate
  market risk?\n\nMarket risks are external influences such as the rise and fall of
  the stock market, interest rates, and international conflict. These factors influence
  the performance of an entire portfolio, and cannot be mitigated by risk diversification.
  \n\nSpecific risks, however, can be avoided in part by investing in a variety of
  assets and asset classes that are not correlated, and therefore won’t all be affected
  in the same way by single events. \n\n## Benefits of risk diversification\n\nRisk
  diversification comes with a variety of benefits including:\n\n* A more stable return
  on your investment, as a diversified portfolio will mean that as one stock fails,
  it is offset by other stocks that have succeeded.\n\n* Minimised losses across your
  whole portfolio, as single events can’t cause you to lose all your investment at
  once.\n\n* More opportunities for returns, as you have invested in a variety of
  assets and asset classes, and are exposed to a range of growth opportunities.\n\n*
  A safeguard against adverse market cycles.\n\n## How to use risk diversification
  within a portfolio \n\nThe three steps traditionally used for risk diversification
  are:\n\n### Step 1: Capital allocation\n\nCapital allocation refers to diversifying
  investments between those that are risky and riskless. This is the first step to
  diversify your investments, in which you determine the overall risk your portfolio
  will be exposed to. This decision will also decide your investment portfolio’s level
  of return.\n\n### Step 2: Asset allocation\n\nAsset allocation determines which
  asset classes you will invest in, based on the relative risk along with the expected
  returns of each asset class. When properly diversified, your entire portfolio’s
  risk can be lower than the risk of the sum of its assets. You may change your asset
  allocation as you go, investing in asset classes with lower risk as you approach
  retirement, in order to ensure safety and stability in your investment portfolio.
  \n\n### Step 3: Security selection\n\nThis involves selecting specific assets within
  each asset class. For example, if you chose to invest in stocks as part of your
  capital allocation, to achieve a diversified portfolio you would need to ensure
  you are investing in stocks from a variety of sectors and industries, ranging from
  small start-ups to large companies. \n\n## Calculate your investment diversification
