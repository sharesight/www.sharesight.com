:title: Track fractional shares with Sharesight
:content: "As we’ve continued to add support for [global stock markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/global-stock-markets/),
  including [Canada’s three largest markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-sharesight-canada/),
  and the [NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE American and OTC markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/),
  the ability to handle fractional shares in [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/)
  has been a highly [requested](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/fractional-shares-for-employee-share-ownership-programs-esop/)
  feature. Today we’re pleased to announce that we’ve added fractional share support
  across those markets with brokers that permit trading in fractional quantities.\n\n![featured

  What are fractional shares?\n\nFractional shares are holdings that amount to less
  that one full share. Typically these fractional quantities are the result of share
  splits, [employee share plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-employee-stock-plans/),
  or [dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/),
  however a growing number of brokers offer fractional quantities for sale, as popularised
  by most robo-advisors, and online brokers such as [Stockpile in the USA](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-millennials-stockpile-lets-you-buy-fractional-shares-2017-12-1011611834)
  and [Stake in Australia](https://stakeshop.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/35000016410-how-do-fractional-shares-work-).\n\n###
  Benefits of fractional shares\n\n- Lets you put all of your cash to work immediately
  (rather than wait to buy a whole share)\n- Helps you best balance your [portfolio
  allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/does-your-investment-portfolio-match-your-appetite-for-risk/)
  (single units of a highly priced share can distort small portfolios)\n- Allows you
  to make the most of [dollar cost averaging](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/)\n\n###
  Caveats of fractional shares\n\n- Typically can't vote in company elections\n- Rounding
  may impact your ability to receive dividends - if you own 10% of a share, and that
  share pays a 1 cent dividend, you may not receive a dividend payment at all\n- Brokers
  that offer fractional share quantities may charge additional fees for the service\n\n##
  Which markets does Sharesight support fractional shares for?\n\nIn addition to allowing
  fractional quantities for interest rate instruments and managed funds, Sharesight
  supports fractional quantities on the following markets:\n\n- AMEX (NYSE American)\n-
  CNSX (Canadian Securities Exchange)\n- CVE (Toronto TSX Ventures Exchange)\n- HKG
  (Hong Kong Stock Exchange)\n- LSE (London Stock Exchange)\n- JSE (Johannesburg Stock
  Exchange)\n- NASDAQ\n- NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)\n- OTC (Over the Counter)\n-
  OTCBB (Over the Counter Bulletin Board)\n- TSE (Toronto Stock Exchange)\n\n![screenshot

  you encounter a market on which you can trade in fractional quantities but that
  we have not yet enabled, let us know in the [Sharesight community](https://c.getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/)
  and we can look into enabling fractional support for it. \n\nAlso note, you can
  merge fractional quantities using our [Merge Holding feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-merge-holding-feature/),
  provided that you are merging into a market that supports fractional quantities.\n\n###
