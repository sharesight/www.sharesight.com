:title: Asset allocation reporting in Sharesight
:url_slug: asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight
:content: "In the TV show [*The Sopranos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos),
  Tony tells his wife Carmela not to worry because he's \"got his money tied up in
  asset allocation.\" One could see why Carmela might be concerned about her family's
  financial future given her husband's line of work.\n\nIn reality, all investors
  have their money allocated in some form or another. Tony's happened to be in large
  bills, hidden in bird seed in his back yard (not recommended in an inflationary
  environment). It's wise to understand to what areas of the economy your money is
  exposed. What happens when stock markets perform well? What happens when the price
  of oil falls? How about interest rates? All of these macro and micro forces affect
  different parts of your portfolio in different ways.\n\n![Asset Allocation Reporting
  in Sharesight - Featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5Lugr9VK7YIium4io0SwYg/fa738c1662c2536aaebc208e6c8943aa/featured_asset-allocation.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  ultimate goal is to build a portfolio that's diversified based on your personal
  situation. If you're young, you'll want to favour riskier growth assets because
  you can afford short term losses. If you're nearing retirement, an asset mix towards
  cash and defensive holdings makes sense as you prepare to draw down your portfolio
  in retirement.\n\nWe designed our new [Custom Groups](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/)
  feature with asset allocation reporting in mind. The challenge we faced though,
  was that [Sharesight](/) customers define asset allocation in many ways. Some prefer
  a basic breakdown, others want more granularity. Furthermore, asset allocation looks
  different based on what country you're investing from and what types of securities
  you can access. \n\nResearch has shown that asset allocation does matter. The academics
  at Ibbotson (now Morningstar) and the University of Chicago did some of the original
  work in this area. [The Importance of Asset Allocation](http://corporate.morningstar.com/ib/documents/MethodologyDocuments/IBBAssociates/ImportanceOfAssetAllocation.pdf)
  and [Asset Allocation is King](http://corporate.morningstar.com/ib/documents/MethodologyDocuments/IBBAssociates/AssetAllocationIsKing.pdf)
  are good primers.\n\n### How To: Asset Allocation Reporting in Sharesight\nEven
  if you're a stock picker, you're probably making investment decisions with some
  respect to the overarching asset class the company belongs to.\n\nOur Custom Groups
  feature lets you plug in any asset allocation methodology you prefer or create your
  own. If you're new to asset allocation, our encouragement would be to start by classifying
  your portfolio based on areas of the economy that are typically decoupled:\n\n|
  **Style** | **Investment Example** | **Risk** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |
  --- | --- |\n| Growth | Equities | High | Listed companies that may perform well
  long-term, but prone to volatility |\n| Defensive | Bonds | Low | Interest-bearing,
  highly rated government bonds or corporate debt |\n| Balanced | Funds, Hybrids |
  Medium | Managed funds that invest in growth and defensive assets, or listed hybrids
  |\n| Cash | Term Deposits | Low | Liquid cash that can be accessed at any time,
  such as a savings account |\n| Alternatives | Derivatives, Commodities | High<sup>1</sup>
  | Range of synthetic investments designed for specific exposure or tactics |\n\n<small><sup>1</sup>
  *Typically alternatives are riskier than other asset classes, although an alternative
  could well and truly be any non-traditional type of asset.*</small>\n\nOn the Custom
  Groups page, begin by giving your grouping a name. Basic Asset Classes, for example.
  Then, create your categories. Remember you can create more than one top-level grouping
  if you want to get more granular later.\n\n![Asset Allocation Reporting in Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2qLqAu8GS86ec8uACqs8uC/8e626a23f16395f792b0cee79f9008fc/screenshot_asset-allocation_1-min.png?w=950)\n\nOnce
  finished categorising, check out the [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/)
  and ensure you view the report using your custom groupings. This will show you a
  current breakdown of your asset allocation.\n\n![Asset Allocation Reporting in Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3jaDPzIH1myWK8cKGISKOy/1f3fc3a718eea057537a8b0ea5880893/screenshot_asset-allocation_2-min.png?w=950)\n\nAlso
  check your [Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/).
  Since each section of the report displays a sub-total this allows you to compare
  the performance of each asset class, which is critical when deciding how to rebalance
  your portfolio.\n\n![Asset Allocation Reporting in Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/31zCh3o5QQya0WSOIemSgk/38a1fea9a6bd6c1f18c64b65233f3d08/screenshot_asset-allocation_3-min.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  above example is **only a basic start**. Many investors will want to break down
  each category into several sub-categories (equity style, for example), which is
  also easy to do with Custom Groups.\n\n### FURTHER INFORMATION\n\n- Blog -- [Announcing
