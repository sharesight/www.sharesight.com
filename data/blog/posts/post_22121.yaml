:title: 'Security update: the Heartbleed bug'
:url_slug: security-update-heartbleed-bug
:content: "As has been widely reported, a serious security vulnerability known as
  the Heartbleed bug was discovered this week. This vulnerability affects OpenSSL,
  the technology that powers encryption across a large portion of the internet.\n\n![heartbleed
  bug - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5A8STdsDQIKk8MU6Y4Y8M6/59533931ea3cc7b4fdd75c04410ef767/featured_heartbleed.png?w=950)\n\nAt
  [Sharesight](/) we closely monitor all aspects of our security and as such we took
  immediate action to ensure that Sharesight was protected against this bug. The appropriate
  security updates were applied within hours of this issue being disclosed by the
  OpenSSL team.\n\nSharesight is now fully protected against this vulnerability. We
  have seen no evidence of any malicious behaviour and have no reason to believe that
  the security of Sharesight was breached in any way.\n\n## Keeping your data secure\n\nWe’d
  like to take this opportunity to remind you that good password security is essential
  to keeping your data secure. \n\nWe recommend that you take a moment to update your
  Sharesight password now, especially if you have not updated your password recently
  or have used the same password on other websites. (To update your password, [login
  to Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/login), and visit the \"My Details\"
  page under \"Account Settings\".)\n\n### Here are our tips for password security\n\n1.
  Complex passwords are more secure. Try to use a mix of upper and lower case characters,
  numbers, and symbols. We recommend using a password that's at least 8 characters
  long. Our password strength indicator will give you an idea about how secure your
  password is.\n\n2. Don't use the same password for multiple websites.\n\n3. Make
  sure you only enter your password on our secure website. The first part of the website
  address should read https://portfolio.sharesight.com. Sharesight will never ask
  you for your password via email or over the phone.\n\n4. Only use the 'Keep me logged
  in’ option on your own password protected computer, never on a public computer."
