  Recently National Australia Bank (NAB) announced that they’re proceeding with the demerger and IPO of CYBG PLC (CYB). According to NAB chairman Ken Henry, the NAB demerger and decision to spinoff Clydesdale Bank will allow NAB to focus on its core markets of Australia and New Zealand.

  The mechanics of this demerger are that existing shareholders in NAB will receive new shares in the new standalone Clydesdale Bank. The total value of the two entities will not change, however, as the value of the new shares in Clydesdale will be offset by a corresponding reduction in the value of your NAB shares.

  ## What the NAB demerger means for investors
  The NAB demerger will have implications for all investors with NAB in their portfolios and may affect your tax situation depending on where you live. The NAB demerger will affect you differently if you’re an AU/NZ investor, an overseas investor, or considered a Small Shareholder. Finally, if you’re ineligible to participate in this demerger, NAB will send you the proceeds of any CYB shares that you would have been entitled to on your behalf.

  ## How to handle the NAB demerger
  1. [Sign up for a FREE Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup) and add your NAB holding.

  2. You'll want to enter a return of capital to your NAB holding. To do so, go into your NAB holding and click Enter a New Trade or Adjustment.

  3. On the pop-up, select *Return of Capital* from the transaction type dropdown.

  4. If you're an Australian or New Zealand investor, you'll want to use 8 February 2016 as the date of trade. If you're overseas, you'll want to use 4 February 2016 (the date the Clydesdale shares started trading in each respective market).

  5. Based on the class ruling detailed [here](https://www.nab.com.au/content/dam/nabrwd/About-Us/shareholder centre/documents/australia-tax-letter.pdf), record a return of capital based on $4.01 per share of CYB (the volume weighted average price, or VWAP).

  6. Now, you'll want to create a new portfolio holding for CYB. To do so, click Add Holding from the Overview or Holdings tab.

  7. Find CYB in the ASX and use an Opening Balance transaction. Note that if you're outside of AU/NZ, you'll want to use the LSE listed security.

  8. Enter the quantity of CYB shares that you acquired using the same $4.01 price mentioned above (the cost base should equal the return of capital from step 4 above).

  9. Note: If you sell your CYB shares within the first year, Sharesight will not apply the 12 month CGT discount. &nbsp;You should be entitled to this if the original purchase date of your NAB shares was at least 12 months ago. &nbsp;You will need to manually adjust this in the CGT report to apply the CGT discount. &nbsp;If you hold CYB shares for more than 12 months after the demerger date then no further adjustments will be necessary.
