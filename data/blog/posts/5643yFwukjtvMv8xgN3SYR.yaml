  November’s Sharesight20ASX snapshot, buy trades were dominated by ETFs, with Vanguard
  Australian Shares (ASX: VAS) and Betashares Nasdaq 100 (ASX: NDQ) strongly favoured
  by investors. Movements in equities reflected this month’s positive announcements
  regarding a [Covid-19 vaccine](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-24/oxford-astrazeneca-covid19-vaccine-gives-australia-pathway-out/12914340),

  to flock to traditional blue chip stocks such as big banks Westpac (ASX: WBC), Commonwealth
  (ASX: CBA), NAB (ASX: NAB) and ANZ (ASX: ANZ). \n\nLet’s look at the news behind
