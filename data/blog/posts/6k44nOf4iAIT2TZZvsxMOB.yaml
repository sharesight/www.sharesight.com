:content: "When building an investment portfolio, there are many choices an investor
  will face – one of them being whether to focus on diversification or concentration.
  Diversification is often recommended to beginner investors or those who are looking
  for more stable returns, particularly when markets become volatile. Keep reading
  to learn more about the benefits and risks of diversification, different diversification
  strategies and how you can track your portfolio’s  diversification with Sharesight.
  \n\n![What is diversification in investing](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/YgnWgsueKci0I5nNMMRjL/5412b3aaac89daa701c28803b86fcd78/What_is_diversification_in_investing.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is diversification in investing?\n\nDiversification is a strategy that minimises
  the risk to your portfolio by investing in a range of assets across diverse industries,
  fund managers, and product issuers. A good investment portfolio diversification
  strategy will ensure you receive stable returns from your investment portfolio.
  \n\nDifferent assets and asset classes will do well at different times and in theory,
  as one industry or market sector dips, other investments will be doing well, balancing
  one another out.  Implementing a strong diversification strategy can therefore yield
  higher returns and offer lower risk when compared to an investment portfolio made
  up of a singular asset or asset class. \n\n## Why is diversification important to
  have in an investment portfolio?\n\nWhile a single high-risk asset may offer the
  potential of a huge payoff, it also comes with the potential for you to lose your
  entire investment in one go should it not succeed. Diversification mitigates the
  risk of pinning all your hopes, and money, on one single investment. \n\nIn a diversified
  portfolio, investment isn’t too heavily weighted towards one sector or company.
  That means even if certain events negatively impact the performance of some of your
  assets (e.g. drought affects agricultural shares), other areas of your portfolio
  will be unaffected.\n\n## How does diversification help reduce risk in investing?\n\nInvesting
  in a variety of different assets from different industries and sectors dilutes the
  risk associated with your investments. For this reason, a well-balanced investment
  portfolio, while not infallible, offers more stable returns in the long run. When
  your investment is spread across a variety of assets, countries and industries,
  market fluctuations have less ability to impact your portfolio.\n\n## Benefits of
  a diversification strategy \n\nOften referred to as [\"the only free lunch\"]( https://forbesbooks.com/diversification-is-the-only-free-lunch/),
  the key benefits of a diversification strategy include:\n\n### Increased exposure
  to opportunity\n\nA diversified portfolio increases your chance of exposure to investments
  that are leaders in their sectors or markets. \n\n### Mitigating risk\n\nWhen you
  spread your investment across a range of industries, countries, and asset classes
  with low correlation, the chance for dramatic events to severely impact your entire
  portfolio is minimised.  While a diversified portfolio cannot mitigate overall market
  risk,  it does help avoid risks specific to particular companies or sectors.\n\n###
  Protecting your investment\n\nOften it's important for investors to have a stable
  portfolio when they are no longer in the wealth accumulation phase of their investments
  and are now hoping to protect what they already have. In this regard, diversification
  can help with the preservation of capital, protecting your savings, and offering
  stable returns.\n\n## Risk of a diversification strategy\n\nWhile diversification
  can be a boon for investors, it doesn’t come without risks. Risks of diversification
  strategies include: \n\n### Diversification can be overcomplicated\n\nThe complexity
  of a diversified portfolio can be a barrier to diversification. More assets and
  asset classes don’t necessarily mean better and ideally, a well-diversified portfolio
  will be simple enough that you can stay on top of the investments you’ve made and
  have a solid understanding of each one.\n\n### Over diversification can lead to
  below-average returns\n\nOver diversification can mean the quality and success of
  your portfolio suffer. If you have 30 underperforming stocks for example, and only
  five successful stocks, your returns will become diluted.\n\n### Higher transaction
  costs\n\nThe more broadly diversified your portfolio, the more you will have to
  pay in transaction fees or high mutual fund fees if you hold too many investments
  in one portfolio.\n\n## What are the types of investment diversification?\n\nThere
  are five styles of diversification across the spectrum of investment:\n\n### Diversification
  across companies\n\nDiversifying your portfolio across a range of companies from
  ETFs, LICS, managed funds, or even a crypto ETF, gives access to an incredibly broad
  variety of companies that aren’t closely correlated and makes for a more stable,
  diversified portfolio.\n\n### Diversification across industries\n\nAs important
  as it is to not simply invest in one company, it is also advantageous to invest
  across industries. Investing in a range of industries and sectors ensures single
  events or \"specific risks\" are less likely to impact your portfolio’s success.\n\n###
  Diversification across asset classes\n\nAsset classes include everything from shares,
  bonds, deposits and real estate to cryptocurrency. It’s important to understand
  the performance and underlying components of your different investments and to not
  over diversify.\n\n### Diversification across geographies\n\nWhile it may seem there
  is a correlation across global markets, investing in multiple markets in multiple
  countries can be hugely beneficial to your portfolio.\n\n### Diversification through
  time\n\nBuying parcels of investments over time (e.g. purchasing small amounts of
  the same shares quarterly or annually) can help mitigate concerns around market
  fluctuations and can average out the cost of bad timing. \n\n## Different types
  of diversification strategies \n\nThe asset allocation in a [well-diversified portfolio](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/diversified-portfolio-examples/)
  is more important than the individual stocks it holds. In a solid investment portfolio,
  you can have a good mix of stocks and mutual funds (or \"equities\"), bonds, and
  cash. When considering what balance you want to strike between these different asset
  classes you need to consider the risk and reward offered by each asset and whether
  you want to invest more in higher-risk options or more stable, steady choices.\n\nAn
  example of a well-diversified portfolio is the [Swenson Model]( https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/diversified-portfolio-examples/)
  by David Swenson, who managed Yale’s endowment from 1985 to 2021. Swenson’s portfolio
  is comprised of:\n\n* Domestic equities (30%)\n\n* Real estate funds (20%)\n\n*
  Government bonds (15%)\n\n* Developed world international equities (15%)\n\n* Treasury
  inflation-protected securities (15%)\n\n* Emerging market equities (5%). \n\nWhat
  makes this a successful portfolio is that no one asset makes up a large portion
  of the investment, allowing it to offer reduced risk while maintaining a solid return.\n\n##
  How do you track investment diversification?\n\nTracking investment diversification
  can be tricky, as by its very nature having a diversified portfolio involves a lot
  of moving parts. It’s possible with a spreadsheet, but time-consuming. \n\nSharesight’s
  investment diversification tracking tool, however, allows investors to see their
  portfolio performance and the diversity of their holdings at a glance. The[ Diversity
  Report](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/portfolios/616422/reports/diversity) function
  delivers reports based on one of six criteria:\n\n* Market\n\n* Sector classification\n\n*

  allocations outside these default groups are also available to users, as well as
  a [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
