:title: Why I use Sharesight to track my portfolio
:content: "When I first started working at [Sharesight](/), I set out to understand
  why an investor wouldn’t just use their broker to check how their shares were performing.
  I learnt quickly that [you can’t rely on your broker for portfolio performance](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/),
  and have my very own experience to share with you.\n              \nA few months
  ago I made my first investment. I wanted to experience exactly what a Sharesight
  customer would experience to help with my marketing role. Plus, based on some of
  the tips I picked up from Sharesight staff it sounded like a good financial decision.\n\nI
  was logging in to my broker’s website many times a day to see how my shares were
  performing because it was all so new and exciting. It was incredible to see that
  in just one day I was making (or losing) a lot more than the interest I was earning
  each month on my savings account.\n\n![featured - Emily Grunberg](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2yRSnZXPcwmSsYEgwSWOEE/223a7c159b3f03778c8ddc01a42c952c/featured_emily-grunberg.jpg?w=950)\n\nOne
  day I logged in to see a market value of zero. I figured it was a glitch but after
  a day or two with no change and no communications, I became a bit concerned. I contacted
  my broker who notified me that there had been a share split, and my investment was
  currently trading under a different symbol. As a new investor, I was confused and
  unsure if everything would go back to normal. What was I meant to do with this new
  symbol? I decided to wait and see.\n\nThis is when the Sharesight magic truly started
  for me. An email came through to let me know there had been a [share split](https://help.sharesight.com/share-splits/),
  and prompted me to sign in and confirm the [corporate action](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/).
  Everything was filled out for me, I just had to press a button to confirm everything
  looked correct and my portfolio went back to normal.\n\n![screenshot - email: ijr-asx](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5QKLelJMSksoMcwKWYsUmC/16bf4107c4295d8effcf6e5189bab149/screenshot_ijr-asx-email.png?w=950)\n\nAt
  the same time, my investment reappeared in my broker’s profit/loss -- but my return
  was way off.\n\nI purchased my 50 shares of ASX:IJR for a grand total of $8,972
  ($179.44 per share). After the share split I owned 100 shares at market value of
  $9,380 ($93.80 per share), but my broker told me that my return was -47.73%.\n\nI
  only have one holding, so it was pretty obvious that it was incorrect. Would other
  investors with multiple investments have noticed this on a quick portfolio performance
  check, or would that return figure have been drowned out? I’m not so sure.\n\nSo
  what happened? Why was my broker telling me I lost 47.73% of my money when my current
  value was almost the same as when I made my initial investment?  It seems the only
  thing my broker had done after the share split was update the number of shares I
  owned from 50 to 100. And to calculate my initial value, they simply multiplied
  100 by the price I paid for my 50 shares: 100 x $179.44 = $17,944. Ah-ha!\n\n| &nbsp;
  | Reality | My broker says | Sharesight says |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ----------
  | ---------- |\n| Purchased | 50 shares | 100 shares ❌ | 50 shares ✅ |\n| Paid |
  $8,972<br>($179.44 per share) | $17,944 ❌ | $8,972 ✅ |\n| After share split I own
  | 100 shares | 100 shares ✅ | 100 shares ✅ |\n| Today my 100 shares are worth |
  $9,380<br>($93.80 per share) | $9,380 ✅ | $9,380 ✅ |\n| My return is | &nbsp; |
  -47.73% ❌ | 4.95% ✅<br>including dividend income |\n\nNot only is my broker calculating
  my performance based on the wrong initial value, it also isn’t incorporating my
  [dividend income](/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/) into my
  performance calculations.\n\n![screenshot - ijr-asx](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5FP5kj1sli0mg0Q0awCoyC/c54649a205f762b44e2191654cc64a19/screenshot_ijr-asx.png?w=950)\n\n**When
