:title: Sharesight release notes - April 2019
:content: "April has been noteworthy for the pre-release of our [Interactive Brokers
  integration](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/add_interactive_brokers)
  to an enthusiastic beta group. We’ve received a lot of great feedback and will be
  continuing to enhance and fine tune things over the coming weeks ahead of releasing
  this to all customers. \n\nThere’s been plenty else happening too, read on for more.\n\n![Sharesight
  release notes April 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2OCD9Z1Pau1FRjUYCOxRL3/6cb04781eb569cd817449478e0198a4b/Sharesight_release_notes_April_2019.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Usability\n\n* Following overwhelmingly positive feedback from our beta users, we
  Introduced a new ‘sticky’ criteria bar on the overview page, so that you don’t have
  to scroll up to the top of the page to alter the report settings. This is particularly
  useful for larger portfolios\n\n* Replaced checkboxes with toggle switches for closed
  positions and dollar/percentage selection. This is much easier to use on touchscreens
  in particular\n\n* Added thumbnail icons to the chart selection dropdown\n\n* A
  range of small usability tweaks to the add holding form, including a smarter way
  to pre-fill the exchange rate for foreign investments\n\n* Substantial performance
  improvements on the sold shares report, reducing the median page load time by almost
  50%\n\n### Broker Import\n\n* Fixes and improved support for 40+ brokers' [Trade
  Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/au/contract_notes/)\n\n* Added
  support for Internaxx and multi trade Commsec International Trade Confirmation Emails
  \n\n### Benchmarking\n\n* Expanded the benchmarking function to allow you to benchmark
  against Unit Trusts, Managed Funds and Ordinary Shares in addition to ETFs \n\n###
  Sharesight API\n\n* Added cash account adjustment settings in Portfolio List, Create,
  Show, and Update endpoints\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- [Sharesight release notes -
