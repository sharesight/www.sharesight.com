:title: Good returns start with quality, independent information
:url_slug: good-returns-need-quality-independent-information
:content: "Convincing investors of all experience levels of the merits of a dedicated
  portfolio tracking solution is a fundamental challenge for us at Sharesight. We
  chat with many investors with decades of experience who can’t quite press delete
  on their macro-intensive spreadsheets; yet we are also faced with a staggering amount
  of new DIY investors who aren’t fully aware of the work required to properly record
  and track their investments. \n\nRegardless of experience level, all investors face
  the same problem: they need to know how their portfolio is actually performing (not
  just price movements and basic capital gains information); and without the right
  portfolio tracking solution, they end up wasting their precious time on tedious
  portfolio admin, leaving them less time to spend on their actual investments. \n\n![Good
  returns](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/hPn2vw11WoDDD95uoS6ex/452d729746394431081b9dac0b3fa563/Good_returns.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Why is it so hard to find high quality portfolio solutions?\n\nFirst of all, let’s
  discuss some of the most common \"portfolio tracking\" solutions available to investors,
  and how they fall short. \n\nIt should be noted that building a portfolio \"management
  solution\" as opposed to a mere “tracker” is hard, expensive, and requires a fundamental
  dedication to independent investing. Nearly every solution out there is designed
  as a strategy to monetise your personal data, to grab your email to sell you investment
  products, or as a stock price widget. Most solutions can’t help but to tell you
  what stock to buy next, either. \n\nUnfortunately for us self-directed investors,
  real-time access to objective, factual and personalised performance data is sometimes
  at odds with the financial providers we depend on – even if they can provide something
  that looks and feels similar. For example, the brokers we rely on have done well
  to build slick interfaces and mobile apps to encourage us to trade more. This is
  their revenue model and they have little incentive to aggregate financial data from
  their competitors, let alone put their name on top of a comprehensive tax report.\n\nEven
  if we do turn some of our portfolio over to a professional at an institution, the
  platforms or wrap account reports that we receive are only as good as the investments
  that they’ve put you in. And those investments were picked from a narrow menu of
  approved products that was based on an agreement with the advice firm and the investment
  manager without your needs in mind. The irony here is that these platforms could
  provide great reporting but that might put their own services at risk. \n\n## It’s
  about you, the independent investor, and your money\n\nThe best solutions tend to
  be built by the people who \"live the problem.\" After all, Sharesight was originally
  a family business, built by an accountant-turned-investor and his son. Twelve years
  later, our business is backed by customers who loved the solution so much, they
  invested in the company. Their feedback, and the feedback from our users, help shape
  our product roadmap.\n\nFundamentally, one of our core deliverables is distilling
  a lot of information from multiple sources down into actionable, standardised insights.
  Data sets on companies and share prices are a commodity these days, but a *personalised*
  rate of return is elusive.\n\nA good example of this is our money-weighted, annualised
  return methodology. The financial headlines may be awash with eye-popping stats
  about tech company share prices, and index \"returns\", but all of this is obtuse
  and merely directional. What matters is your financial experience with your investments
  – when you entered, exited, and the fees you paid to do so. As human beings we live
  our lives in annual chunks, creating yearly budgets and paying our taxes and school
  fees annually. It only makes sense that we think of our portfolios in the same way.
  After all, a 10% return over 10 years and a 10% return over one year are two very
  different outcomes. \n\nYou can also put these returns into context with our benchmarking
  feature, which lets you compare your portfolio to the broader market by tracking
  it against a realistic investment alternative (such as an ETF or index fund). This
  is especially relevant in volatile markets where you need to know if your lacklustre
  performance is simply due to the prevailing market conditions, or your own investment
  choices, for example. Ideally, you will discover that you are outperforming, or
  at least matching, the market on an annual basis – inclusive of capital gains, dividends,
  brokerage fees and foreign currency. But if you find yourself underperforming compared
  to the benchmark, you can make an informed decision to change your investment strategy
  or even re-allocate your money into the ETF or fund in question. \n\nThese are just
  some examples of how investors can benefit from using a portfolio tracking solution
  built for the needs of independent investors, such as Sharesight. There is a lot
  of noise in the investment industry, and it can be hard to decide where to turn
  or who to trust. But one thing you can always trust is a solution that provides
  access to quality, independent information and actionable insights – not the latest
  investing craze or vague, generalised stock data. And if it automates your portfolio
  admin for you, that’s even better. \n\n## Start tracking your investments with Sharesight\nIf
