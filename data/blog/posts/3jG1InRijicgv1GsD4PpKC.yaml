  Travel** (ASX: CTD) was the most-bought stock by SMSFs in October, after a mixed
  month for the company. Corp Travel’s share price saw a significant drop in October
  following the release of its [Q1 2021 results](https://www.fool.com.au/2020/10/27/why-the-corporate-travel-management-asxctd-share-price-sank-7-5-lower-today/),
  which revealed an average monthly revenue of $9.6 million and underlying EBITDA
  loss of $2.4 million. The company also completed its [capital raise](https://themarketherald.com.au/corporate-travel-management-asxctd-completes-113m-retail-entitlement-offer-2020-10-20/)
  of $375 million, a portion of which was spent on the acquisition of US business
  [Travel and Transport](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/why-we-think-corporate-travel-management-s-recent-acquisition-is-a-game-changer).
  \n\n**Woodside Petroleum** (ASX: WPL) saw its share price hit a 16-year low in October
  after reporting a [43% drop in its Q3 2020 revenue](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/australias-woodside-petroleum-posts-42-fall-in-third-quarter-revenue-2020-10-21),
  which was attributed to Covid-induced oil price cuts. The company also announced
  its intention to [cut 300 direct staff jobs](https://www.energynewsbulletin.net/workforce/news/1397005/woodside-confirms-300-direct-staff-jobs-to-go),
  which represents just under 8% of its workforce. \n\n**Mesoblast** (ASX: MSB) experienced
  a [40% plunge in its share price](https://www.fool.com.au/2020/11/02/why-the-mesoblast-asxmsb-share-price-crashed-40-lower-in-october/)
  throughout October following the FDA’s [rejection of its drug](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/mesoblast-hit-by-fda-rejection-request-to-run-another-trial),
  remestemcel-L. Things could be looking up for Mesoblast however, with the continued
  enrolment of Covid-19 patients in a [phase 3 trial](https://stockhead.com.au/health/mesoblast-has-treated-dozen-of-covid-19-patients-with-its-remestemcel-l-drug/)
  of its stem cell treatment, and another meeting with the FDA in November. \n\n**Afterpay**
  (ASX: APT) was the most-sold stock by SMSFs in October. The company’s share price
  reached a record high after announcing a [deal with Westpac](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/afterpay-westpac-200032265.html)
  to provide Afterpay-branded digital banking services using Westpac’s technology.
  This led analysts to question whether Afterpay is trying to move into the growing
  Australian [neobanking industry](https://www.finder.com.au/afterpay-to-offer-savings-accounts),
  and whether this will turn Westpac’s existing [Millennial customer base](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/westpac-ceo-on-afterpay-bank-distribution-fundamentally-changing-20201103-p56b2h)
  onto Afterpay. \n\n**Telstra** (ASX: TLS) is another company that experienced a
  share price drop in October, hitting a multi-year low of $2.68. This came after
  the announcement of an [executive shake-up](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/telstra-shakes-up-executive-management-team-20201027-p568wb.html)
  which will see the departure of Telstra group executive Michael Ebeid after two
  years in the role. The company also launched its [5G home internet plan](https://thenewdaily.com.au/life/tech/2020/09/30/telstra-nbn-5g-optus/)
  to compete with the NBN, and has tentatively agreed to maintain its [16 cent dividend
  payment](https://www.sharecafe.com.au/2020/10/14/telstra-vows-to-keep-dividends-up-nbn-covid-circles/).
  \n\n**Zip Co** (ASX: Z1P) had a busy month in October, announcing an [integration
  with Visa](https://smallcaps.com.au/zip-co-bnpl-sector-mainstream-new-tap-zip-feature/)
  that will vastly expand the coverage of Zip Pay. The company also acquired fashion
  search engine [The Urge](https://www.businessnewsaus.com.au/articles/zip-co-acquires-fashion-search-engine-the-urge.html),
  and announced the [doubling of its transaction volumes and revenue](https://www.businessnewsaus.com.au/articles/zip-co-volumes-surge-as-credit-card--demise--gains-momentum.html)
  compared to the previous year. \n\n**BHP** (ASX: BHP) made headlines in October
  after abandoning a [$3.5 billion expansion plan](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-20/bhp-dumps-multibillion-dollar-olympic-dam-expansion-project/12785258)
  for South Australia’s Olympic Dam. This led to a steep drop in the company’s share
  price, which reached a 5-month low of $33.78 at the end of October. BHP also confirmed
  that [Chinese orders of coal are being deferred](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-14/bhp-deferment-confirms-chinas-reduced-demand-for-australian-coal/12768004),
  following reports that some Chinese industries have been forbidden from buying Australian
  coal, and that ports are no longer accepting shipments. \n\n**a2 Milk** (ASX: A2M)
  is another company that has been impacted by decreased revenue from China. The share
  price struggled throughout October, after a2 revealed that its Q1 2021 results are
  expected to miss the mark due to disruptions to the daigou arm of the business.
  The company has assured that it continues to see [\"strong underlying consumer demand\"](https://www.farmonline.com.au/story/6955252/a2-warns-on-china-disruption/)
