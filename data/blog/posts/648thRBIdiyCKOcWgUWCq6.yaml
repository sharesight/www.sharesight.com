:title: Sharesight Mobile App - January 2017 update
:url_slug: sharesight-mobile-app--january-2017-update
:content: |-
  Following-up on the [launch of our mobile app](/blog/introducing-the-sharesight-mobile-app/) and all the great [feedback](https://community.sharesight.com/topics/when-are-the-ios-android-mobile-apps-coming-guys) we’ve received, we’re pleased to announce the **Sharesight Mobile App -- January 2017 update**.

  ![Featured - Sharesight Mobile App 2017-01](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3hNsR6GpoAkSIIes6cIgey/096638a5b80e0660002f4ca3835d02f6/featured_sharesight-mobile-app_2017-01.png?w=950)

  ## What’s new in the Sharesight Mobile App -- January 2017 update
  Beyond a few design and text changes, here are the major changes included in this update:

  ### 1. Additional holding information
  From the portfolio overview screen, clicking on a holding now displays the quantity details:

  From there, clicking on “more details” reveals 3 new data tabs:

  **Overview** -- Includes total return details (capital gain + income gain + currency gain), a price chart, and the instrument information.

  **Transactions** -- Reveals detailed transaction and income information.

  **News** -- Displays the latest Google and [Livewire](/blog/livewire-market-insights-within-your-portfolio/) news related to the holding.

  ### 2. Cash accounts
  [Investor, Expert](/pricing/) and [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) clients who are tracking cash accounts (via our award-winning [Sharesight + Xero integration](/xero/)) may now scroll down to the bottom of the portfolio overview screen to view the cash account details alongside their other portfolio holdings:

  ### 3. Apple devices restricted to iOS 8 and up
  The mobile app was causing issues for a handful of clients using older versions of iOS, so unfortunately we’ve had to restrict usage to iOS 8 and up.

  ## What’s next
  Please note that the Sharesight Mobile App -- January 2017 update does not include [Google Login](/blog/login-to-sharesight-with-google/). We are actively developing that feature and it will be included in a future release.  If you have additional ideas, or questions about the mobile app, please leave a message in our [dedicated forum topic](https://community.sharesight.com/topics/when-are-the-ios-android-mobile-apps-coming-guys), we’d love to hear from you!
