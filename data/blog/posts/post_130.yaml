:title: Diversify or bust?
:url_slug: diversify-or-bust
:content: "In my last blog I suggested that a lot is made of the merits of diversification
  without any real analysis of the costs and benefits. There often seems to be an
  assumption that more is better when it comes to diversification. I suggested that
  beyond a certain point, diversification is likely to impede, rather than contribute
  to, superior returns.\n\nInvestors who place a significant proportion of their savings
  in shares are often more diversified than they think. They should not allow themselves
  to be railroaded or frightened into diluting their returns by diversifying further
  into lower yielding assets.\n\nFor one thing, if they have followed the old adage
  of getting rid of their mortgage before they start saving seriously, they are likely
  to already have a significant investment in residential real estate.\n\nSecondly,
  shares in themselves are an excellent way of diversifying across a range of different
  companies operating in widely varying sectors such as infrastructure, manufacturing,
  retail, tourism, mining, telecommunications etc. It is easy to invest in Australian
  as well as NZ shares so you get some country diversification too. \n\nAs an aside,
  many people have lost money in several different finance companies recently. No
  doubt they were heeding the call to diversify when, in reality, they were doing
  the opposite – investing in similar companies all in the same sector.\n\nSo my contention
  is that people with a freehold home who invest a significant proportion of their
  savings in NZ & Australian shares can be adequately diversified. And they are likely
  to end up with a significantly larger retirement nest egg than if they had diversified
  into other, historically lower-yielding, assets. The only major rider is to only
  invest funds in shares that you are confident you will not need in the short or
  medium term – say within 7-10 years. That way you minimise the risk that you will
  have to sell your shares before they have been able to generate the higher returns
  you want.\n\nAs a final word on diversification let’s say that 10 years ago you
  decided to diversify away from shares by placing some funds in an ANZ term deposit
  (unsecured). I’m not sure what your average interest rate over the last 10 years
  would have been – let’s be generous and say 7% p.a. What I can tell you (by checking
  it out on Sharesight) is that if you had bought ANZ shares 10 years ago instead
  of making that term deposit, your return would have been 25.23% p.a!\n\nMakes you
  think doesn’t it?\n\n<small>*This information is not a recommendation nor a statement
