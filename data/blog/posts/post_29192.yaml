:content: "We are absolutely thrilled to be named **Xero Add-On Parter of the Year,
  Industry Specific 2014**! A massive thank you to all of our clients and of course
  to Xero!\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\"
  dir=\"ltr\">Well done to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sharesight\">@Sharesight</a>,
  Add-on Partner of the Year (Industry Specific) at this year&#39;s Xero Awards Aus!
  ^EF <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/xerocon?src=hash\">#xerocon</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/UxxWzddA7z\">pic.twitter.com/UxxWzddA7z</a></p>&mdash;
  Xero accounting app (@Xero) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Xero/status/502767870242459648\">August
  22, 2014</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
  charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nEvery year, Xero holds Xerocon, its annual conference
  for their clients, Add-On Partners, and thought leaders. The culmination of this
  three day event is the gala awards dinner at which they announce their award winners.
  This year Xero chose us as best Add-On Partner, Industry Specific. We were stunned
  when Rod Drury and Chris Ridd said \"and the winner is... [Sharesight](/)!\" and
  flashed our logo on screen in front of 1,500 people. Scott Ryburn, our co-founder
  and Product Manager did his best Oscar acceptance speech imitation.\n\nWe've been
  a Xero Add-On Partner for five years. We've built a terrific relationship with Xero
  in that time -- it helps that our Wellington HQ is just down the road from the \"Xeroplex.\"
  If you haven't yet tried [Sharesight + Xero](/xero/), you really need to. Trades
  and dividends go from Sharesight to Xero in real-time, while they send us bank feed
  data for cash tracking. You've got a total portfolio accounting solution (and access
  to the Xero ecosystem) in two tabs on your browser.\n\nOur mission is to empower
  investors and the accountants and financial advisers who serve them. This is a big
  job. The structure of the financial services market makes it a difficult challenge,
  but one that we're committed to majorly disrupting. To have the support of Xero
  means a lot (and gives us an even bigger microphone). Xero has changed the accounting
  industry globally. With Sharesight, those accountants now have a way to involve
  themselves in their clients' investment portfolios. And as Xero and Sharesight move
  into the financial advice market together... expect big things and more disruption.\n\n##
