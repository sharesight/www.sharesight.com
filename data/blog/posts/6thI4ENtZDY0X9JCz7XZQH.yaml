  Importance of portfolio tracking\n\nKicking off the presentation, Doug shared the
  latest Sharesight data on the performance of Sharesight SMSF portfolios vs a number
  of superannuation and other funds - including the contributions of both dividend
  and capital growth on the total annualised return.\n\n![Sharesight SMSF vs markets](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/ILJCDsqzy3UZLHnXg694j/eed331e2853d7f2abf633b5618e2e0bc/Sharesight_SMSF_vs_markets.png?w=950)\n\n##
  The five lessons for investors\n\nInvestors can learn from the mistakes of those
  who came before them. Doug broke down five key lessons investors need to learn and
  be mindful of when investing to avoid falling into common traps. \n\n![5 lessons

  Tracking your performance\n\n\nTracking your performance on an annualised basis
  gives you an apples to apples comparison when looking at the relative performance
  of your investments. The majority of brokers do not report annualised returns -
  here's all the ways your [broker's performance numbers can mislead you](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/).\n\n![Annualised](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/y3RjyCsWjbt1LQwm2wh5I/2ab3c1e539cd5eb56fea8c6bbd9c5f17/Annualised.png?w=950)\n\nNot
  taking into account the impact of dividend income on your portfolio performance
  leaves you seeing only part of the picture. \n\n![dividend impact returns](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5GfO7LcdzMPPTImb2FgzNj/bcade3eae68b9bcd1789afba28739150/dividend_impact_returns.png?w=950)\n\n##
