  loss selling (also known as tax loss harvesting) is a strategy some investors leverage
  to minimise their net capital gains during the financial year with a view to reduce
  their capital gains tax liabilities.\n\nWhile investors can choose to sell shares
  at a loss at any time, it is most often something retail investors look to implement
  in the lead up to the end of the financial year — and is something we’re expecting
  to see more of at Sharesight in response to recent COVID-19 market volatility.\n\n![COVID-19

  What is tax loss selling?\n\nIn the broadest sense, tax loss selling involves selling
  loss-making investments to realise capital losses in order to \"net out\" capital
  gains the investor has realised during the year.\n\nLet's look at a hypothetical
  example to help illustrate how this works:\n\nLet’s say you were lucky enough to
  buy CSL (ASX: CSL) back in 2012 when it was trading at $32. It’s currently sitting
  at $305.84, so on paper you’ve seen an annualised return of 33.16%.\n\nHowever,
  formerly high-flying Retail Food Group (ASX: RFG), which you bought at $4.00 back
  in 2014, is now only trading around $0.075 per share after a couple of turbulent
  years.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Holding</td>\n    <td>Purchase Value</td>\n    <td>Market
  Value</td>\n    <td>Capital Gain</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>ASX: CSL</td>\n
  \   <td>$3,200.00</td>\n    <td>$30,557.00</td>\n    <td>$27,357.00</td>\n  </tr>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <td>ASX: RFG</td>\n    <td>$4,000.00</td>\n    <td>$75</td>\n    <td>$-3,925.00</td>\n
  \ </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nShould you think it’s time to take some profits off the table,
  you could decide to sell some (or all) of your CSL shares, while also exiting your
  loss-making position in RFG. This would offset some of the gains made — all while
  softening the psychological blow of realising the loss in RFG.\n\n### Notes on tax
  loss selling\n\n* In the above example, since CSL has been held for longer than
  12 months, it [may be eligible for the CGT discount](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/Working-out-your-capital-gain/).\n\n*
  Although many investors leverage tax loss selling toward the end of the financial
  year, investors can harvest tax losses at any time in the financial year.\n\n* Capital
  losses on shares can in some circumstances be carried forward to [offset future
  capital gains](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/Capital-losses-on-shares-and-units/).\n\n*
  Modelling tax loss selling opportunities across larger portfolios is best done using
  a spreadsheet or specific software like [Sharesight’s Unrealised Capital Gains Tax
  Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/).\n\n*
  Whether you are considered to be holding shares as an [investor or a share trader](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/shareholding-as-investor-or-share-trading-as-business-/)
  matters to the Australian Tax Office (ATO), as gains for share traders are treated
  differently.\n\n## Avoid wash sales\n\nOne thing investors should be very mindful
  of is the potential to fall afoul of the ATO, in particular tax ruling [TR 2008/1](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=TXR/TR20081/NAT/ATO/00001),
  which specifically forbids arrangements where \"…in substance there is no significant
  change in the taxpayer’s economic exposure to, or interest in, the asset, or where
  that exposure or interest may be reinstated by the taxpayer\".\n\nIn other words,
  the ATO does not view kindly investors who sell a stock in one financial year to
  take advantage of a capital loss event, only to buy that stock again in the new
  financial year. This is known as a \"wash sale\" and the ATO will disallow the loss
  if the sole intention of the sale was to minimise tax.\n\n**Investors should always
  consult their financial advisor or accountant to understand how these rules apply
  to their individual circumstances.**\n\n## Why does tax loss selling often occur
  in June?\n\nFor tax purposes, each financial year is used as a snapshot in time
  to assess the tax payable by individual Australians. Because of this, the timing
  of *when* investment income is earned, or when investors realise capital gains/loses
  is important.\n\nOften this will mean that as investors near the end of the financial
  year, they look back over their portfolio and assess whether to bring forward the
  sale of particular investments to realise a capital gain or loss in the current
  financial year (to offset existing losses or gains), or to hold off a trade to fall
  in a subsequent financial year.\n\nIn fact, some experts [believe](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/tax-loss-selling-2019-roadmap)
  that many stocks that have fallen during the financial year will slide in early
  June as investors ‘tidy up’ their portfolios and execute tax loss selling. Further
  to this point, at Sharesight we always see a surge in the number of investors using
  our Unrealised Capital Gains Tax Report surge through June as they seek to \"lock
  in\" their final portfolio position in the lead up to the June 30 end of the financial
  year.\n\n## Why it could be even more pronounced this year \n\nOne word. Volatility.\n\nWhile
  ASX returns for the first half of the financial year have been some of the strongest
  since the GFC, the ASX 200 index is down around 20% for 2020 with some sectors,
  in particular finance, down about 30% over the same time period.\n\nThis volatility
  has had a sizable impact on the number of trades Sharesight’s Australian users are
  conducting, with the average number of trades for users on paid Sharesight plans
  up over 60% in March compared to the same period in 2019.\n\nWith investors ramping
  up their trading activity as they navigate the volatility of markets during the
  COVID-19 pandemic, we expect this to have implications for how many investors turn
  to tax loss selling strategies as they attempt to net-out the gains (or losses)
  realised through this flurry of trading activity.\n\nTo get a feel for how widespread
  this would be in the lead up to the end of the financial year, we asked Sharesight
  users during May if they intended to sell loss-making investments in their portfolios
  before June 30 in order to offset gains they had made during the year and found
  that almost half of respondents (44%) planned to do so.\n\nLooking at the spread
  of responses by investors we found:\n\n* 22% were very likely to\n\n* 22% were likely
  to\n\n* 8% were undecided\n\n* 18% considered themselves unlikely to sell down investments\n\n*
  31% were very unlikely to\n\nWhile a lot could change before EOFY, these responses
  say a lot about investors' willingness to crystallise losses in order to offset
  gains and place themselves in the best tax position to ensure a fresh start for
  the next financial year.\n\n![chart survey tax-loss-selling-2020 (1)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5Kz8XJLXdg83SLV5oG5tEu/fb96b85fe728aa915677d7218b6fb804/chart_survey_tax-loss-selling-2020__1_.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Investors need to stay on top of their portfolios\n\nThe market volatility caused
  by COVID-19 has seen many retail investors adopting a more active approach to investing.
  This includes an increase in trading activity and considering strategies such as
  tax loss selling. \n\nIf this is an approach you’re considering, it’s important
  to stay mindful of how this trading activity will impact your capital gains tax
  liabilities come the end of the financial year. Dedicated tools like [Sharesight’s
  Unrealised CGT report can help](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/).
  \n\n*We recommend that you always speak with your financial advisor and/or accountant
  to get a professional opinion and fully understand how these issues impact your
  personal financial situation.*\n\n## Sign up for Sharesight today\n\nJoin [over
