:title: The tax admin trap for Australian ETF investors
:content: "###### Disclaimer: Sharesight does not provide tax or investment advice.
  The buying of shares can be complex and varies by individual. Seek tax and investment
  advice specific to your situation before acting on any information in this article.\n\n*This
  piece was originally published on the [Morningstar website](https://www.morningstar.com.au/stocks/article/investing-basics-australias-etf-tax-admin-nig/204940)*\n\nExchange-traded
  funds continue to gain popularity with self-directed investors and it's easy to
  see why. They offer access to a basket of securities, often with low management
  fees, conveniently rolled-up into one security that trades like a stock on the exchange.\n\nLaunched
  in 1993, assets invested in ETFs globally broke through the $5 trillion mark in
  2019. On the back of this, Bank of America strategists now predict the ETF market
  will hit $30 trillion in assets under management by 2030. That’s on par with the
  GDP of the entire US economy.\n\nLooking at our own data on ETF popularity from
  over 100,000 DIY investors and financial professionals who track their portfolio
  and investment performance with Sharesight, 36 per cent of self-managed super fund
  (SMSF) users bought or sold an ETF in 2019, a significant increase on a figure of
  only 5 per cent in 2009. \n\n![SMSF ETF data](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4sILBmxPzxDvbrqFUuM2zt/85c8753449111f472e205908293ac870/SMSF_ETF_data.png?w=950)\n\nDespite
  these advantages, ETFs can become a tax administration nightmare for investors who
  choose to go off-platform or don't rely on a managed service.  \n\n## ETF tax admin
  in Australia\n\nETFs create tax complications because the Australian Taxation Office
  (ATO) classifies them as trusts, not ordinary company shares. Complicating matters
  further, the ATO changed the rules around investment trusts in 2016 by creating
  the Attribution Managed Investment Trust (AMIT) regime.\n\n### What is an Attribution
  Managed Investment Trust?\n\nTo understand [Attribution Managed Investment Trusts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/),
  a good place to start is Managed Investment Trusts (MITs). An MIT is a trust structure
  that allows investors to purchase \"units\" in the trust to access the underlying
  investment activities the trust is set up to undertake, generally investing in shares,
  bonds, or property.\n\nIn 2016 the Australian government overhauled MITs with the
  aim of making fund administration easier and the sector more competitive globally
  by introducing AMITs.\n\nThe AMIT structure allows trustees to \"attribute\" taxable
  income to investors, without the need to make a distribution payment to unit holders.
  Removing the need to pass through all income immediately, as with traditional trusts.\n\nThis
  change has implications for how the cost base is handled and introduces several
  complications for investors at tax time.\n\n### An example: Vanguard Australian
  Shares ETF (ASX: VAS)\n\nIf we look at an AMMA statement from Vanguard’s VAS shares,
  which paid four dividends throughout the financial year this statement is from,
  those payments morphed into **17 distributions and two capital gains components**
  on the annual taxation statement. In turn these correspond to 10 items on an individual
  tax return. Staggering complexity for just one buy!\n\n![VAS AMMA statement](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/pFJOYYVM08nUtH5Cb7nko/0725fe93f851308510176ba1cdc8adb9/VAS_AMMA_statement.png?w=950)\n\n*Why
  does this happen?*\n\nVAS invests mostly in ASX shares, whose companies in turn
  pay dividends, are subject to franking credits and which undergo corporate actions.
  This creates all sorts of tax implications. VAS also invests in unlisted securities,
  derivatives and overseas companies each with their own tax nuances.\n\nAs time goes
  by, you receive VAS distributions in cash (usually quarterly or half yearly), along
  with a simple statement from the registry showing the net payment. At the end of
  the year, the registry will send you a final AMMA statement.\n\nThese final statements
  contain all the component and subcomponent information and are far more detailed
  than what you received during the year. This information can retroactively modify
  your cost base and taxable dividend income, making your tax lodgement very difficult
  and risking investors paying more tax than they need to.\n\n## ETF investors need
  to be mindful of the tax implications\n\nETFs opened a world of opportunities for
  investors. I use them myself as a building block for my portfolio. But one thing
  we’ve learned from our users at Sharesight is that with this ease of access to investments
  opportunities through ETFs, comes additional tax administration burdens that investors
  need to be mindful of.\n\nTo help limit this ETF tax admin burden on investors we’re
  working with our partners at [Computershare](https://www.sharesight.com/au/partners/computershare/)
  to automatically provide accurate AMIT trust distribution data directly within Sharesight.
  Securing this data takes time, but we’re looking forward to having this available
  for the most recent financial year soon.\n\n \n### FURTHER READING\n- [5 ways Sharesight
