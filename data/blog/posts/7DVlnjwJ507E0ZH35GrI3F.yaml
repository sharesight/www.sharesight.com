  What is the Bursa Malaysia (KLS) exchange?\n\nThe [Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad](https://www.bursamalaysia.com/)
  (formerly known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) was established in 1930 and
  is the primary securities exchange in Malaysia. It allows investors to trade in
  stocks, ETFs, bonds and derivatives, as well as a range of Islamic stocks that are
  Shariah-compliant. \n\nBursa Malaysia also owns the[ Labuan International Financial
  Exchange (LFX)](https://www.bursamalaysia.com/trade/market/labuan_international_financial_exchange),
  which allows investors to trade in multicurrency instruments and securities. This
  is compatible with Sharesight, which supports [67 global currencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-investments-in-67-different-currencies-with-sharesight/)
  and includes the impact of [foreign exchange rates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  in calculating investment performance. \n\nSharesight users can track more than
  900 stocks and ETFs on the Bursa Malaysia exchange, with more continually being
  added. This is in addition to stocks in [major Asian markets](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)
  such as the Tokyo (TYO), Hong Kong (HKG), Singapore (SGX) and Bombay (BSE) stock
  exchanges. \n\n## How to track the Bursa Malaysia exchange on Sharesight\n\n1. If
  you’re not using Sharesight yet, sign up for a [FREE account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
