:title: A seriously flawed business model
:url_slug: a-seriously-flawed-business-model
:content: "In my previous blog I highlighted the need to [invest in companies with
  a sound business model that is sustainable in the long term](/blog/so-whats-it-to-be-a-dog-or-a-lame-duck/).
  Sounds good eh? But what the heck is a business model and how do you know if it
  is sound?\n\nWell, and I’m sorry if you think this is a copout, the easiest way
  to answer the question is to discuss a business model that is demonstrably not sound.
  For example the one under which many, if not most, finance companies operate.\n\nFinance
  companies do the same thing as the major trading banks – they lend money. So why
  have the big banks in NZ survived for many decades while finance companies fall
  over at regular intervals and have unacceptably short life spans? It’s all to do
  with the business model under which they operate.\n\nIn essence the major banks
  adopt a business model that calls for a risk profile that gives them a good chance
  of surviving a 1 in 50 or 1 in 100 year business downturn. On the other hand one
  could be forgiven for wondering whether some finance companies have any sort of
  risk strategy at all let alone clearly articulated business model. If they do, it
  is obviously calibrated, whether they realise it or not, to survive a 1 in 5 or
  1 in 10 year downturn but not much more. This is just not good enough.\n\nA number
  of finance companies demonstrated their inadequate business models very graphically
  in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s by collapsing and, for reasons best known to
  themselves, a further 20+ finance companies have decided to prove that history does
  repeat by collapsing over the last 2 years or so.\n\nPut simply, the finance company
  business model involves lending money in circumstances that the major banks deem
  to be too risky. It is profitable business when the economy is booming but it is
  a recipe for disaster when one of the inevitable low points in the economic cycle
  arrives.\n\nIf you doubt what I’m saying look at the excuses finance companies trot
  out when the proverbial hits the fan. For example ‘Hanover, a New Zealand business
  with the size and strength to withstand any conditions’ is at a \"standstill.” Apparently
  this is as a result of a number of factors, including a loss of investor confidence
  in the finance sector, a weak property market and the global credit crunch. These
  things have occurred repeatedly in the past and will do so again and, despite what
  the finance companies claim, they are not the problem. The problem is that their
  business models have not been designed to cope with them.\n\nHanover is not the
  only failed finance company to blame the property market. Some finance companies
  have a large percentage of their book exposed to property development. Others have
  a huge exposure to second-hand cars. And it is not uncommon for them to have 30-40%
  of their lending exposure to one or two clients. \n\nCompare this with a major bank
  whose business model would severely restrict, if not totally forbid, any exposure
  to property development or second-hand cars and would not countenance an exposure
  of even 1% of its book to a single client let alone 10, 20 or 30%. And if the Banks
  do finance property development, you can bet your bottom dollar their business model
  will require first ranking security: not the second or third ranking position finance
  companies seem happy to accept.\n\nAnother crucial thing is that Reserve Bank demands
  that the major banks’ business models include sufficient equity to cover the losses
  that might occur in a serious downturn. This is not demanded of finance companies.
  It will be interesting to see whether the Hanover shareholders, who have the personal
  resources to inject enough equity to cover investor losses, actually do so.\n\nThere’s
  a lot more to a comprehensive business model than what I have mentioned of course.
  But the point is that, almost by definition, finance companies are likely to have
  a flawed business model with an unacceptably high credit, liquidity and operational
  risk profile. Otherwise they would end up in the same space as the major banks where
  they simply would not be able to compete.\n\nI know it is a bit late now to say
  don’t invest in finance companies but if you are lucky enough to still be around
  for the next finance company boom in 10 years time or whenever, you will see history
  repeat - again. My advice is don’t be tempted to join the high flyers: keep your
  feet firmly on the observation deck.\n\n<small>*This information is not a recommendation
