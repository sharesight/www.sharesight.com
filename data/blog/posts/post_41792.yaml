:title: Our take on the budget
:url_slug: take-budget
:content: |-
  The recently released Australian Budget was a win for small business. We'll have to wait and see what happens after the Senate sinks it teeth into it, but we think all tech companies should be cautiously optimistic. The prospective crowdfunding avenue and the further changes to equity awards are significant developments.

  ![Budget 2015 - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/55UTgXcM9qM6ek8gC2ymwo/f2f43d68199d6a00799b812de85a046b/featured_budget-2015.jpg?w=950)

  We have a rich history of connecting DIY investors with capital markets in this country (namely to resources and banks). Now's our chance to continue, but this time in the tech sector. This is Australia's start-up moment and it shouldn't be squandered. Time to diversify!
