:title: Sharesight Stock Picking Competition - Final Results!
:url_slug: sharesight-stock-picking-competition--final-results
:content: "In the lead up to 2018 we emailed [Sharesight](/) users asking them to
  nominate one stock (from select markets) they believed would be the top performer
  for the 2018 calendar year (January to December). We then constructed a Sharesight
  portfolio containing the nearly 100 stocks chosen, allocating $10,000 to each in
  the portfolio.\n\nNow that 2018 is over it’s time to find out which stocks performed
  best, which performed worst, and most importantly, which was the winning stock pick!\n\n![featured
  sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2c0QkcckTOG6ogCOoSG0OM/4bfa658c0ff385d657680e730f455704/featured_sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How did the overall portfolio perform?\n\nIn a word, terrible. The Sharesight stock
  picking competition portfolio had a total return (including dividends) of -17.77%
  in 2018, with a capital loss of -20.63% only offset by small gains from dividend
  and foreign exchange movements from stocks in markets outside Australia.\n\nThis
  contrasts with a -1.35% total return for the ASX200 (using the [STW.AX Spdr 200
  Fund ETF as a benchmark](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/))
  over the same period. As we noted previously, this suggests that building a portfolio
  that consists entirely of growth stocks that might be potential winners in a stock
  picking competition may not be the best investment strategy.\n\n## 5 best performing
  stocks in 2018\n\n![Best Performing Stocks 2018](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7tBzjSXj3PowUwFYMHKtYZ/c2fcf76117564c06fc171d9e7db456ec/Best_Performing_Stocks_2018.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Nearmap Limited (ASX.NEA)\n\nThe Australian aerial imagery technology and location
  data company is our stock picking competition winner. The company showed strong
  momentum throughout the year, taking and holding top spot from the end of the third
  quarter after the company [broke into the S&P ASX 300 index in August](https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2018/09/07/nearmap-ltd-asxnea-and-kogan-com-ltd-asxkgn-just-entered-the-sp-asx-300-index/).
  Nearmap returned 152.10% during the year.\n\n### Cynata Therapeutics Limited (ASX:CYP)\n\nThe
  Australian based stem cell therapy company announced it has [\"met all clinical
  endpoints\" on its stage 1 trial of drug CYP-001 and is looking to stage 2 trials](https://smallcaps.com.au/cynata-therapeutics-advance-cymerus-stem-cell-treatment-phase-2-trials/)
  and has [Japanese rivals scrambling to catch up](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Japan-hurries-to-regain-lead-in-race-for-stem-cell-therapies).
  Cynata’s shares have slid compared to their highs around June, finishing up 109.68%
  for the year.\n\n### Afterpay Touch (ASX:APT)\n\n\"Buy now, pay later\" company
  Afterpay Touch looked like an early favourite to win, especially after trading at
  all-time highs above $20 during August, [before sliding almost 25% in early September](https://www.fool.com.au/2018/09/07/why-the-afterpay-touch-group-ltd-share-price-is-falling-again/)
  after Afterpay announced an [expansion into the UK after acquiring 90% of existing
  operator ClearPay Finance](https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/afterpay-announces-uk-expansion-as-sales-volume-soars-20180822-h14crh)
  and raising $104 million to fund growth, then sliding further in the fourth quarter
  to $12.40. Afterpay shares returned a still impressive 107.71% in 2018.\n\n### Seafarms
  Group Ltd (ASX:SFG)\n\nThe sustainable aquaculture company reached an major agreement
  in May with Japan based Nissui (TYO:1332) over a $24.99 million equity investment
  in Seafarms Group that would assist in the development of Seafarms’ Project Sea
  Dragon plans to build a large scale prawn aquaculture project in northern Australia
  to produce prawns for export markets. The first major piece of the project was announced
  in June, with the [acquisition of a 52ha site in Kununurra](https://thewest.com.au/business/seafarms-group-secures-kununurra-site-for-project-sea-dragon-ng-b88521387z)
  to build the processing plant for the project. This sent shares higher -- before
  settling 69.23% up over the year.\n\n### Altium Limited (ASX:ALU)\n\nThis Australian
  based PCB design software company clawed back some of its impressive gains seen
  during 2018. After hitting nearly 100% returns in September, the stock saw a total
  return of 65.54% by year end.\n\n## 5 worst performing stocks in 2018\n\n![Worst
  Performing Stocks 2018](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3lapvs6ZgkfoBa7c99Oxc2/aecefa47c09750b65057deaae50323c3/Worst_Performing_Stocks_2018.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Blue Sky Limited (ASX.BLA)\n\nAfter being the target of [short seller Glaucus back
  in April](http://www.afr.com/markets/behind-blue-skys-brutal-multiyear-war-with-short-sellers-20180406-h0yfa7),
  diversified alternative asset manager Blue Sky’s share price has not recovered since
  taking out the worst performer crown in our June update, with a total return of
  -94.53% in 2018.\n\n### Ookami Limited (ASX:OOK)\n\nAfter buying a ‘strategic equity
  position’ in [blockchain company Brontech](https://stockhead.com.au/tech/ookami-rockets-69pc-buying-piece-blockchain-biz-brontech/)
  in December 2017 (and pushing shares up 42% at the time), the stock for this blockchain
  venture company fell considerably through to June, and before settling somewhat
  to return -91.43% in 2018.\n\n### Retail Food Group (ASX.RFG)\n\nAfter [Retail Food
  Group’s horror performance in 2017](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-retail-food-group-RFG-shares-slashing-so-quickly-What-is-the-future),
  the fortunes of the company have not improved materially in 2018. The company announced
  a [$306.7 million loss after recording $427 million in asset impairments](https://www.afr.com/business/retail/retail-food-group-crashes-to-307m-loss-after-asset-impairments-store-closure-costs-20180828-h14nbd)
  and costs from closing almost 250 stores during the year. On top of the RFG’s [managing
  director Andrew Nell stepping aside in May and Richard Hinson being appointed CEO](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/embattled-retail-food-group-appoints-new-ceo-20180529-p4zi3s.html),

  online bookmaker changed its name in the third quarter after selling its ‘[TopBetta’
  and ‘Mad Bookie’ retail brands to PlayUp Limited for $6 million](http://www.abnnewswire.net/press/en/93688/The-Betmakers-Holdings-Limited-(ASX-TBH)-Completes-the-Sale-of-Retail-Assets-93688.html).
  The company also placed an additional $3 million of shares to raise funds and [acquire
  Global Betting Services and Dynamic Odds in August](http://www.gamingintelligence.com/manda/48885-australia-s-betmakers-set-to-complete-gbs-and-dynamicodds-acquisitions).
  Markets pushed the total return for TBH to  -87.25% by year end.\n\n### DigitalX
  (ASX.DCC)\n\nSpecialising in [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  initial coin offerings (ICOs) and blockchain consulting, Australian firm DigitalX
  had a horror year that saw the stock perform even worse than the return investors
  in [bitcoin](https://dqydj.com/2018-bitcoin-return/) saw during the same period,
  as well as [DigitalX clients taking the company to Australia’s Federal Court](https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-clients-file-claim-against-publicly-listed-ico-advisory-firm-digitalx).
  DigitalX ended the year down -83.45%.\n\n## Special mention - Big Un Ltd  (ASX.BIG)
  - Delisted\n\n![Big Un Ltd Delisted](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7lQSdqMWolmtTvs7b9mwm8/3d1bc525762832b6eea326847cd18544/Big_Un_Ltd_Delisted.png?w=950)\n\nSocial
  media video company Big Un Ltd had a stellar 2017, before the company unravelled
  in spectacular fashion early in 2018 collapsing -34.16% and being [delisted from
  the ASX](http://www.delisted.com.au/company/big-un-limited) after investigations
  were launched by both the ASX and ASIC into the company. [Administrators were appointed
  in August](https://insolvencynotices.asic.gov.au/browsesearch-notices/notice-details/Big-Un-Limited-Administrators-Appointed-106399311/f2f8b4f8-9e44-421e-95cf-d011360719db?appointment=Voluntary%20Administration),
  and it looks unlikely it will resume trading at this stage, though [Big Un Board
  members appear keen](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/big-un-falls-but-are-the-evertz-boys-ready-to-pick-up-the-pieces-20180827-p4zzzj.html)
  to do so.\n\nThis [story in the Australian Financial Review on the  fall of Big
  Un Ltd](https://www.afr.com/business/inside-the-boiler-room-that-is-big-un-limited-20180301-h0wv2t)
  is quite thorough and worth a read by all investors. \n\n## Congratulations to our
  winner who picked Nearmap Limited (ASX.NEA)\n\nWe’d like to thank everyone who entered
  our 2018 Stock Picking Competition, and congratulate our winner who picked Nearmap.
  We’ll reach out to the winner by email to arrange delivery of their prize, an [Amazon
  Echo (2nd Generation)](https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-echo-speaker-with-wifi-alexa-dark-charcoal/dp/B06XCM9LJ4)
  so they can quickly find out their Sharesight portfolio performance by asking Alexa
  – thanks to [Sharesights Alexa skill](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-now-has-an-amazon-alexa-skill/).\n\n##
  See how the stocks in our 2018 competition continue to perform\n\nWe’ve made the
  [2018 Sharesight stock picking competition portfolio public](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)
  for anyone to view, removing the need to be logged-in to Sharesight to follow these
  stocks in 2019.\n\n### 2018 Stock Picking Competition Notes:\n\nWe collated your
  responses (discarding invalid picks/typos/duplicates) and created a Sharesight portfolio
  with a holding of each share picked, with the following rules:\n\n- The 2018 Sharesight
  Stock Picking Competition portfolio was created with a tax residency in Australia
  (with the performance of shares in markets outside Australia subject to currency
  effects)\n\n- We \"invested\" $10,000 in each holding, but did not include brokerage
  for matters of convenience here. (Sharesight factors the impact of fees when [calculating
  portfolio performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/),
  as [reducing portfolio fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092815/how-optimize-your-portfolio-and-reduce-fees.asp)
  can improve returns).\n\n- All dividends are/will be included in the total performance
  calculation, and are reinvested. \n\n- Performance figures are total return (versus
  annualised) as none of the portfolio positions has been held for longer than one
  year.\n\n- The winner will be the person(s) who picked the top performing stock
  over the period January 1st through to December 31st 2018.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
