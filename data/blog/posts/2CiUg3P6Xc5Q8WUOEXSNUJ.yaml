:content: "The ex-dividend date is one of the four key dates you need to be aware
  of as a dividend investor, along with the announcement date, record date and payment
  date. It’s important to understand how the ex-dividend date works and the impact
  it can have on stock prices, plus how you can use this knowledge to your advantage
  in your investing strategy. \n\n**This article covers:**\n\n* [How the ex-dividend

  How does the ex-dividend date work? \n\nA stock’s ex-dividend date is usually set
  one business day before the record date. The ex-dividend date is the date by which
  you need to own the dividend-paying stock in order to receive the upcoming dividend
  payment. If you purchase shares of the stock on or after this date, you will be
  ineligible for the upcoming dividend payment and the seller will receive the dividend
  payment instead. \n\n## Important dividend dates\n\nWhen it comes to dividends,
  there are four important dates for investors to keep in mind:\n\n### Announcement
  date\n\n* The announcement date (also known as the announce date or declaration
  date) is the date on which a company’s board of directors announces the next dividend
  it will pay to its shareholders.\n\n* The announcement will include the ex-dividend
  price which will be paid to shareholders. This is typically a dollar amount per
  share owned – for example, $0.12 per share.\n\n* The announcement will also include
  the date that the dividend will be paid (the payment date), and the cut-off date
  by which an investor must hold that stock in order to earn the dividend (the record
  date).\n\n### Record date\n\n* The record date is the cut-off date established by
  the company to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend.\n\n*
  An investor must be on the company’s shareholder record on this date in order to
  receive the dividend payment.\n\n### Ex-dividend date\n\n* Once the record date
  is set, the ex-dividend date, also known as the ex-date, ex-entitlement date, or
  reinvestment date (or ex-distribution date when referring to funds or trusts) is
  determined based on the rules of the stock exchange on which the security is traded.\n\n*
  Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date.\n\n*
  This is required because when you buy or sell a stock, the trade takes one business
  day to fully settle. This is known as \"T+1\" settlement.\n\n* If you purchase and
  hold a security before its ex-dividend date, you will receive the next dividend.
  Conversely, if you purchase a security after the ex-dividend date, you will not
  receive the dividend.\n\n### Payment date\n\n* The payment date or pay date is the
  date when dividend or distribution checks are sent or deposited into investor accounts.\n\n*
  If a shareholder has opted into a company’s [dividend reinvestment plan](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/),
  then the dividends or distributions will be reinvested in lieu of a cash payment.\n\n##
  How often do dividends get paid?\n\nThe [frequency of dividend payments](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/when-are-dividends-paid-by-stocks/)
  will depend on the individual company, with some companies paying dividends monthly,
  quarterly, semiannually or annually. In some cases, this can also depend on the
  origin country of the dividend-paying stock. In the US, for example, most companies
  tend to pay dividends quarterly, while in Australia it is more common to receive
  dividend payments semiannually. It should also be noted that in some cases, a company
  may pay a special dividend in addition to its regular dividend, often due to an
  unusually strong financial performance. \n\n## An example of a dividend announcement
  and payout\n\nTo help explain how dividends are announced and paid out, here’s a
  real-life example of a recent dividend paid by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). \n\n![apple
  dividend](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/Scv4sklUwvcM6v9QwNlit/4f8edc2564d412dcc9393980cf9cd377/apple_dividend.JPG)\n<small>
  Source: nasdaq.com </small>\n\nAs can be seen from the screenshot above, on January
  27, 2022, Apple declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share, to be paid on February
  10, 2022. The dividend’s ex-date was February 4, 2022, meaning shareholders who
  owned shares in Apple prior to this date were eligible to receive the dividend,
  whereas those who purchased shares on or after this date were not. \n\nThis is how
  the dividend payout would have been calculated for a shareholder who owned 1,000
  shares of Apple prior to February 4:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><b>Shares held
  prior to dividend’s ex-date</b></td>\n    <td><b>Dividend per share</b></td>\n    <td><b>Dividend
  paid</b></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1,000</td>\n    <td>$0.22</td>\n    <td>1,000
  x 0.22 = $220</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nBased on this example, on February 10 Apple
  would have sent the investor a $220 cash dividend in the form of a cheque or bank
  deposit.\n\n## The impact of dividend dates on stock prices\n\nWhile a stock’s dividend
  history plays into its popularity amongst dividend investors, the announcement and
  payment cut-off dates also have an effect on its price. Here’s a breakdown of which
  dates to keep in mind when deciding to buy or sell a particular stock.\n\n### Announcement
  date\n\nThe announcement date is important because a change in the expected dividend
  or distribution payment can cause the security to quickly rise or fall as investors
  respond to new expectations. \n\nFor example, if a company that usually pays a dividend
  announces a dividend that is lower than expected (or no dividend at all), the market
  may interpret it as a sign that the company is having financial difficulties, and
  the price will go down. While in reality the company may have decided to use its
  profits to hire more people or increase its R&D budget, market sentiment is the
  ultimate decider when it comes to the stock’s price.\n\nOn the other hand, a dividend
  announcement naturally encourages investors to purchase stock, therefore boosting
  its price. For this reason, many companies strive to pay consistent dividends to
  their shareholders.\n\n### Ex-dividend date\n\nBecause investors know they will
  receive a dividend if they purchase a stock before its ex-dividend date, they are
  often willing to buy it at a premium. This often causes the price of a stock to
  increase in the days leading up to its ex-dividend date. \n\nThen, when the market
  opens on the ex-dividend date, the security will usually drop in price by the amount
  of the expected dividend or distribution to be paid. While this decrease is really
  based on market sentiment rather than any set rule, it makes sense because the dividend
  comes from the company’s reserves, therefore technically decreasing the value of
  the company.\n\n###### __Note:__ When a security is trading without the value of
  its next dividend payment included in its price, it is known as \"trading ex-dividend\".
  During this period, the acronym “XD” may appear next to its stock symbol on trading
  platforms.\n\nBecause the price of a security drops by about the same value of the
  dividend, buying it right before the ex-dividend date shouldn’t result in any gains.
  Similarly, investors buying on or after the ex-dividend date get a \"discount\"
  on the security price to make up for the dividend they won’t be receiving.\n\nYou
  might think it’s a good idea to buy a stock shortly before the ex-dividend date
  and sell it on or shortly thereafter, in order to make a quick profit on the dividend.
  This strategy is called \"dividend stripping\" or “dividend capture” and it is generally
  not a good one. That’s because, as mentioned above, the price of a stock tends to
  be reduced by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. So you would very
  likely just break even – and that’s not including the two brokerage fees you would
  have to pay for the buy and sell transactions.\n\n## Where to find dividend information\n\nThere
  are a few places you can rely on for dividend dates and payout amounts:\n\n### Check
  the stock or fund provider\n\nOne place you can look for dividend information is
  with the stock or fund provider. For example, the [Vanguard Australia](https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/home/en)
  website allows you to view up to 10 years of distributions for the Vanguard MSCI
  Index International Shares ETF (ASX: VGS), as seen in the screenshot below. \n\n![VGS
  distributions](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5CgPjQqG3Gb7vHbgOhycaY/426e4b250f47a9f1650cecd02fe7051e/VGS_distributions.JPG)\n\nWhen
  researching a new stock or fund you’re looking to invest in, this can be a good
  way to understand its [dividend yield](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-dividend-yield-trap/)
  and predict what future income you might expect from the security (with the understanding
  that past performance is no guarantee of future results).\n\n### Automatically track
  dividends with Sharesight\n\nIf you invest in dividend-paying stocks, the best way
  to [keep track of your dividend payments](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  is with Sharesight. This is because when you add a stock to your Sharesight portfolio,
  Sharesight automatically syncs any dividends that you have received since the stock’s
  purchase date (going back to 1 January, 2000), while also tracking any ongoing dividend
  payments you receive. You can also click on any of your stocks’ dividend records
  to view more information about the dividend and edit the data as required.\n\n![Apple

  seen in the screenshot above, Sharesight displays key dividend information such
  as the paid, ex, and announcement dates, dividend  amount, dividend type, exchange
  rate and foreign tax component. Depending on your portfolio’s [tax residency](https://help.sharesight.com/au/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/),
  other information may appear on this dividend record. For example, if the portfolio
  has an Australian tax residency, the record will also display Australian tax components
  such as the TFN holding tax and [franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/).\n\nAnother
  benefit of using Sharesight to [track your dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  is that it factors your dividends into your performance return. This is important
  because dividend payments can really add up over time, making up a significant portion
  of your return. Additionally, dividends are not usually tracked by your broker,
  so if you’re relying on your broker’s return figures, you’re [missing the full picture](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  of how your portfolio is really performing.\n\n### See upcoming dividends with the
  Future Income Report\n\nOnce you’ve added all your holdings to Sharesight, you can
  run the [Future Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/)
  to see a breakdown of all the upcoming (announced) dividends for stocks in your
  portfolio. The report estimates your upcoming dividend income based on your actual
  holdings, and provides the ex-date and payment date for each security, making it
  a useful way to project your portfolio’s cash flow, or even [track your monthly
  dividend income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-monthly-dividend-income-from-your-investments/).
