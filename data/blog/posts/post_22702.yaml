:title: How do I run an Australian capital gains tax report?
:url_slug: how-do-i-run-capital-gains-tax-reports-in-sharesight
:content: "We love blogging about [new features](/blog/the-improved-sharesight-interface-new-body-same-engine/)
  and [trends](/blog/earth-blogging-switching-apple-android/), but it’s important
  we don’t lose sight of one of the most useful and valuable features in [Sharesight](/):
  CGT (realised and **un**realised) reporting. We suppose if this were a 1980s sitcom,
  this would be the moment when the cheesy music starts and the father sits the son
  down on the lounge for a heart-to-heart chat.\n\nNormally, it costs $300 to subscribe
  to our [Aussie Investor Plan](/au/pricing/) for one year ($275 if you sign up for
  12 months). Having your portfolio's tax position calculated in two mouse clicks
  has got to be worth at least that much alone. If you disagree, how about we throw
  in unlimited holdings across three portfolios, unlimited shared portfolio access,
  support for overseas share markets, and [Xero](/xero/) synchronisation?\n\nThere
  are two capital gains tax reporting options in Australian Sharesight plans. Both
  found in the [Reports](https://help.sharesight.com/reports/) menu:\n\n## 1. Unrealised
  Capital Gains Tax Report\n**(Available in Australian [Investor, Expert](/au/pricing/),
  and Australian [Shareight Pro](/pro/) plans)**\n\nThe [Unrealised Capital Gains
  Report](/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/) calculates unrealised
  capital gains in your portfolio and the resulting taxable income that *would* arise
  if these shares were sold on the report date. The report is designed for forecasting
  purposes only, but is extremely useful as we approach tax time. Basically you can
  model your CGT liability. We’ve seen our share of market uncertainty so far in 2014.
  The ability to see the tax effect of crystallising those gains (or losses) is valuable
  for investors and professionals. Doing this with two clicks of your mouse is even
  better. The report is based on the ‘discount method’ for shares that were held for
  more than one year and the ‘other method’ for shares held for less than one year
  (you can change your discount rate on a per portfolio basis in the Settings menu).
  The report itself breaks down the portfolio’s short and long term unrealised capital
  gains, and any unrealised capital losses. Remember you can export this data to Excel,
  PDF, or better yet, you can [share access to the portfolio with anyone you wish](/blog/sharing-is-caring/).\n\n![Unrealised
  CGT Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1GW3uUI3QMCecsmsE0i26A/0926edaade6902dd9206cc9901b3c168/unrealised-cgt.png?w=950)\n\n![unrealised

  That's going to be an ugly tax bill</i></small> \n\n## 2. Capital Gains Tax Report\n**(Available
  in all Sharesight plans, except NZ)**\n\nThe Australian [Capital Gains Tax Report](/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  calculates capital gains made on shares as per Australian Tax Office rules. Here
  again, the report is based on the ‘discount method’ for shares that were held for
  more than one year and the ‘other method’ for shares held for less than one year.
  Again, you can change your discount rate on a per portfolio basis in the Settings
  menu The report itself breaks down short and long term capital gains and capital
  losses. Same as the unrealised report also provides a nice summary table at the
  bottom:\n\n![CGT Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/ruRtKoH2DuWawyEMauKQc/0ea98a2cd343a9431229ef1fa9f8267d/cgt-report.png?w=950)\n\n![CGT
  Summary](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2RJIvq6NTaySaOIcUKGIuM/2cd6cbb90e7157f704efa1590e992f1a/cgt-summary.png?w=950)\n<sub><i>You
  may export to Excel or PDF</i></sub>\n\n## But wait... there's more\n\nYou can customise
  your date ranges on both reports and you can lock in the method you've chosen. This
  means that you can alter the sale allocation methods again in the next reporting
  period without invalidating the CGT result for a previous period. Pretty cool.\n\nYou
  can also change your sale allocation method by clicking the button on either report.
  Choose from FIFO, LIFO, Maximise Capital Gains, Minimise Capital Gains, or our Sharesight
  Minimisation Method. Our in-house method is handy. We'll assume that you sell shares
  resulting in the lowest capital gains tax first. This method is more sophisticated
  than the Minimise Capital Gains method because it takes into account the discounting
  rules. The sales allocation method can be changed for specific holdings or for the
  entire portfolio.\n\n![change-sale-allocation-method](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4OyXvzeIAU4mg40UU6UQKc/f7c7e4f40fb3c8f7493f753159f4e1e1/change-sale-allocation-method.png?w=950)\n\n![sale-allocation-method](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3h9zFLymcgAKeUgkUeKQm2/054dc9e676c9ecfa0b91933a079ef27c/sale-allocation-method.png?w=950)\n\nLast
  you can choose to carry forward any losses from the previous reporting period. The
  carry-forward loss will be included in the losses section of the report.\n\n![losses-carried-forward](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4wamJ5c5lKi2gSaggUoYUO/7f23b149cfe7d066512037e2b58c5d10/losses-carried-forward.png?w=950)\n\n**Your
  time is better spent doing about a million [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEuvBqQBXvk)
  [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7hrQTeb15c) than trying to work out your
  portfolio tax liability on a spreadsheet at the kitchen table. [Make a tiny investment
  in Sharesight](/au/pricing/) and get a few hours of your life back.**\n\n### FURTHER
