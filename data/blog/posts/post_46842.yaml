:title: 'Announcing a new partnership: Republic Wealth Management'
:url_slug: announcing-new-partnership-republic-wealth-management
:content: "###### Note: this partnership has expired and this integration is no longer
  in place.\n\nWe're pleased to announce a new partner, [Republic Wealth Management](https://www.republicwealth.com.au).\n\nRepublic
  is a robo-adviser catering to financial planning companies. They take care of the
  portfolio construction, execution, and on-going management of portfolios on behalf
  of financial planning companies. The portfolios consist mainly of [ETFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund).
  \n\nRepublic and the advisers they serve will be utilising a branded edition of
  [Sharesight](/) and [our API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) to administer
  and report on client portfolios.\n\n![Republic Wealth Management - Featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/eMVmw3MNTqeKiGyukakCY/eabb55349607740eaa775281ac5cd209/featured_republic.png?w=950)\n\nThis
  B2B approach makes sense. One of the challenges for any asset manager is convincing
  people to hand over money. This is especially true in the online advice space, which
  by nature lacks face-to-face meetings and a track record. Portfolios constructed
  of low-cost ETFs backed by academic rigour are all well and good. It's difficult
  to argue that a strategy like this doesn't belong in everyone's portfolio in some
  way shape or form. The hard part is convincing people, notably younger people with
  less money, to invest.\n\nBy offering their service to dealer groups, Republic will
  have access to funds already invested in the market. Plus, their product may well
  prove to be a cost-effective (i.e. online) way for financial advisers to acquire
  clients new to the investment space - those millennials with less money to hand
  over, many of whom need some old fashioned financial advice.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n-
