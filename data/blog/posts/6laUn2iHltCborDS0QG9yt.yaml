:title: 8 New Year's resolutions for investors in 2019
:content: |-
  Stock market experts are [divided](https://www.investopedia.com/2019-stock-market-predictions-from-3-gurus-4582719) as to whether 2019 will be a bull or bear market. While no one can say for sure how things will land, there are a few things you can do to take more ownership of your portfolio and save some money in the process. So if getting your portfolio in order is a resolution for you this year, here are 8 very specific things you can do to help you get there:

  ## 1. Lower your management fees
  Most of us know that management fees eat into returns, but like a lot of “life admin”, we don’t do anything about it. Make 2019 the year you invest in yourself by cutting back on investing-related fees.

  For example, a typical managed fund might have a managed fee of 2%, whereas a comparable ETF could have fees around .2%. Over 20 years, an initial $10,000 balance with $500 monthly contributions and a 5% annual return will mean a difference of over $40,000! That’s because not only are you taking money out to cover the management costs, there’s also less money to compound over time.

  ## 2. Switch to a low-cost broker
  Since every dollar counts (especially during a market downturn), it might be time to switch to a low-cost broker. Whether you’re trading often, or buying small parcels on a monthly basis, saving $5-10 per trade can really add up in the long run. Just do your research before switching to ensure your potential new broker has the features you’re looking for, including support for things like [dividend reinvestment plans](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/), [email trade confirmations](/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-sharesight-from-100-brokers/), [third-party integrations](/partners/brokers/), etc.

  ## 3. Track your dividends
  Unless you’re 100% invested in growth stocks, you need to keep track of your dividends. They impact your returns and the tax you pay, so keeping track of them is essential. For example, if I was going by share price alone, I’d think my Canadian [RRSP portfolio](/blog/rrsp-and-rrif-canadian-tax-settings-in-sharesight-portfolios/) return was currently -1.71%. However because I track my portfolio using [Sharesight](/) -- which automatically keeps track of my (reinvested) dividends -- I can clearly see that my portfolio return is actually 7.39%.

  For more information on why you should track your dividends, see *[3 reasons why you need to be tracking dividends](/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)*.

  ## 4. Track your portfolio against the market
  Seeing negative returns in your portfolio is never fun, but by [benchmarking](/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/) your portfolio, you can understand whether your performance is tied to the overall market downturn or not.

  ## 5. Automate your future trade tracking
  Ask your broker to automatically forward your future trades to [Sharesight](/). You’ll save countless hours of manual portfolio admin every month, not to mention at tax time. Trades from over [over 100 brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/) can automatically flow into Sharesight via an API or Trade Confirmation Emails (contract notes). If your broker doesn’t provide Trade Confirmation Emails, you’ll want to set aside some time each week/month to [manually record your trades](https://help.sharesight.com/recording-trades-dividends-and-adjustments/).

  ## 6. Do as much of your own accounting and tax prep as possible
  Taking ownership of your portfolio accounting by using [Sharesight](/) can not only decrease your accounting bills, but also ensures fewer overall surprises at tax time. You can run your own [Taxable Income](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/) and region-specific tax reports such as [Australian CGT](/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/), [Canadian CGT](/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/), and [New Zealand FIF and Traders Tax](/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-nz-investors-at-tax-time/).

  ![iPads - Taxable Income Report + CGT Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2XxiDrWzssC22EMgSQUOSE/27768b37e7b6ea45105ea1bcb052f743/ipads_taxable-income-cgt.png?w=950)

  Bonus resolution: [share secure portfolio access with your accountant](/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/), instead of emailing sensitive documents back and forth.

  ## 7. Stay informed
  Understanding what’s going on the world can help you understand why your portfolio is performing the way it is, and help you to make sound investing decisions going forward. For general tech and business news, I subscribe to [Finimize](https://www.finimize.com) and [The Hustle](https://thehustle.co), and I listen to the [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/archive/) and [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) podcasts (all free).

  ## 8. Subscribe to portfolio alerts
  Sharesight’s weekly portfolio summary email provides an overview of your portfolio’s performance over the last 7 days.
