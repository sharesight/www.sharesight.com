  ## Australian Investors Association 2019 summit theme

  The theme of this year’s summit is: *Back to the Future -- Future proofing portfolios in an era of Trump, Trade Wars, Tariffs & Tax*. As stated on the summit brochure:

  > Investors have a lot to worry about, experts are predicting a 20% fall in Australian property prices, a change in government will see major tax changes including the likely loss of franking credits.

  > Global interest rates are rising, inflation is starting to rear its head again, asset valuations are stretched, disruption is everywhere and markets are once again volatile. With the majority of American economists now predicting a recession within the next two years, investors need to ensure they future proof their portfolios.
