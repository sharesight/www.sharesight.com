:title: Benchmarking now live on Sharesight
:url_slug: benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight
:content: "###### UPDATE: 30-May-2019: You may now [benchmark your portfolio against
  any stock, ETF, or fund](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)\n\nWe're
  starting 2015 with a bang by announcing a major new feature. [Benchmarking](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/)
  is now available to all clients on the [Investor, Expert](/pricing/), and [Sharesight
  Pro](/pro/) plans!\n\nUnderstanding how your portfolio is performing is a critical
  ingredient to being a successful investor. [Sharesight](/)'s performance tracking
  is all about helping you with this goal and benchmarking is the next step in this
  process. You use Sharesight, so you know exactly how your investments have performed,
  but how do they compare to the overall market? How about overseas markets? Is your
  performance strong simply because the overall market went up, or is it due to the
  individual stocks you picked, or down to your asset allocation? Lots of market uncertainty
  out there. You need to know exactly where you stand.\n\n![Benchmarking - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/XlIIqxYeaGka0IwciiGUE/1d38ddbb9e43eaa0798d45b1b50b2eed/featured_benchmarking.png?w=950)\n\nBenchmarking
  allows you to select **any ETF** on our database to use for comparison. Note that
  a benchmark is&nbsp;saved at the portfolio level, so it can be applied to all portfolios
  in your account. \n\nWithin the advanced options menu above the chart on the [Portfolio
  Overview page](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/), you'll find a new section
  for selecting your benchmark instrument.\n\n![Benchmarking your investments - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/45Hwe8EfjG0IOI2i6cUmiu/a85816a1a59b268fa3feddfacd9317ab/blog_benchmarking_1.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  common benchmark dropdown menu offers you preselected options for tracking your
  portfolio against popular market indexes. The list is made up of popular index-tracking
  ETFs on the ASX and NZX. We think this is a good starting point.\n\n![Benchmarking
  your Investments - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3qptC3fiTCSsqiws8KkqUU/df71edac2c920011b6e676a6c681ad49/blog_benchmarking_2.png?w=950)\n\nBut
  you can search for a specific security by typing in the name or code. So if you
  want to track your portfolio against a Gold ETF you're in luck:\n\n![Benchmarking
  your investments - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2EEeCgJj2UIKiOmasg8Awo/f65ae14026f14f1df0e9e3bd66639786/blog_benchmarking_3.png?w=950)\n\nClick
  \"Apply\" and the benchmark will be saved against your portfolio. You'll immediately
  notice a new line of data underneath your portfolio's capital, income, and currency
  return, which displays the selected benchmark's performance. Makes for a quick like-for-like
  comparison.\n\n![Benchmarking your investments - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3GGvD2kYz6siMIQmMAwqMi/703aa7736b665efacd1c1d2c84d84946/blog_benchmarking_4.png?w=950)\n\nAnd
  what would benchmarking be without charting? Selecting the \"graph performance\"
  option in the chart type dropdown menu will reveal your portfolio's performance
  versus your benchmark.\n\n![Benchmarking your investments - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/m743kNRGpw2UO4MI04EgK/775f78e71bfa44c6d7fafcbaa29d1185/blog_benchmarking_5.png?w=950)\n\n**This
  is where our developers added a bit of extra mustard to make Sharesight benchmarking
  better than anything else we've seen.**\n\nEven though everyone talks about \"the
  market,\" it's a difficult concept to grasp when you try to work out what your hard-earned
  dollars would have done had they been invested in \"the market.\" Indexes are theoretical,
  complex and not particularly useful.\n\nWe've chosen to compare your portfolio with
  your chosen benchmark **as if you'd invested equal amounts of real money in both**.
  When you plot your holdings on the chart, you'll see that the Y-axis scales so that
  both investments begin at the same point. Tracking your mouse along the lines will
  display a pop-up that shows how the value of each changes.\n\n![Benchmarking](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1daL8HN8Pu0e0agEQ8kM28/7efcf679f405c463d27f47c121ee000a/blog_benchmarking_6.png?w=950)\n\nThis
  is also why we've used real ETFs as our suggested benchmarks versus the broad market
  indexes. You and I can actually invest in an ETF. It's a legitimate, tradable security
  that we can actually put our money to work in. Not so with the generic market indexes
  we see in the newspaper or on TV. An ETF is similar to a traditional index in that
  it tracks a market, sector, or country, but an ETF also reflects the cost of investing
  (management fees) and factors in things like franking credits.\n\nPlease also take
  a minute to read our Help section on [how to interpret the return index graph](https://help.sharesight.com/interpreting-the-return-index-graph/).\n\nAs
  with all our new features, take some time to investigate and [let us know your feedback](https://community.sharesight.com).\n\n###
