:title: Sharesight CEO a panelist at Computershare ETF Forum
:content: "Last month, I was invited to speak at the [Computershare](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/computershare/)
  ETF Forum in Melbourne. The event brought together leaders from the asset management,
  research, accounting, and technology industries.\n\n[Computershare](https://www.computershare.com/au)
  is one of Australia’s original tech companies, and by virtue of that most certainly
  one of the world’s first fintechs. Founded in the late 1970’s, they’ve gone on to
  become massive with a market cap of about $10B. A slow and steady approach has served
  them and their investors well.\n\nA share registry might not come to mind when thinking
  about financial technology, and I’ll admit the investor experience of actually using
  a registry website isn’t exactly state of the art. I was, however, impressed by
  the questions being asked at the event and Computershare’s renewed focus on the
  ultimate end user, the mum and dad investor.\n\nSharpening this [DIY investor](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-reasons-why-buy-and-hold-investors-use-sharesight/)
  focus is certainly the rise of ETFs. \n\nWhether you’re new to investing or an institutional
  fund manager, chances are you’ve got an ETF in your portfolio. Their increasing
  popularity among investors has been [well documented](https://www.firstlinks.com.au/etf-tax-treatment/)
  in the financial press. In fact, in 2018 21% of investors tracking their [SMSFs
  on Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/smsf-unbundling--how-much-can-it-save-you-in-2017/)
  bought or sold an ETF, a significant increase on [just 3% in 2008](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/the-exchange-traded-fund-etf-tax-nightmare/).
  And because ETFs are listed investments, they’ve increased the interaction between
  investors and share registries.\n\n![Computershare ETF Event Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4J7AU2G2Pc1xaBAicuQ1IG/80373ad8894a9f185e9ec8d69d4b94e0/Computershare_ETF_Event_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  ETF Forum issues important to investors\n\n* ETFs are still growing in popularity.
  Expect to see more exotic ETFs enter the Australian market, particularly actively
  managed and alternative ETFs.\n\n* Despite the Banking Royal Commission, fee pressure
  on financial advisors, and fintech alternatives, ETF policy is still being driven
  by the big end of town.\n\n* ETF manufacturers and distributors still seem tethered
  to legacy distribution channels like financial planning dealer groups and investment
  platforms (why no ETF ads during the Australian Open, for example).\n\n* Nobody
  understands how ETF distributions actually work (massive exception to this is the
  [work Computershare and Sharesight have done](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/)
  jointly).\n\n* The [AMIT regime](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  has amplified the above complexity to the extent that even professional fund managers
  aren’t using it to lower their taxable exposure.\n\n* \"So how is this making it
  easier for the end investor?\" This question was asked by a senior Computershare
  executive and my favourite part of the day. While ETFs and their array of asset
  classes are great for the DIY investor, they’ve created a high administrative overhead.\n\n##
  Share registries’ fintech future\n\nI’ve long advocated that share registries are
  sleeping giants in the fintech world. For decades, they’ve carried out boring, but
  critical registry functions on behalf their clients: listed companies and investment
  trusts. But all that time have been ammassing two valuable assets: users and data.\n\nIf
  the trend of DIY investors gaining more access and control over their investing
  future continues (which it will) using platforms like [Sharesight](/). it will be
  interesting to see how Computershare might leverage this. \n\n### FURTHER READING\n-
