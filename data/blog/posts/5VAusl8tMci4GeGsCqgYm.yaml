:title: Wrap-up of the 2017 British Australian Fintech Forum
:content: "Last month [Sharesight](/) was invited by the Australian British Chamber
  of Commerce to [represent Australian fintech on a trip to London](/blog/sharesight-wins-spot-on-british-australian-fintech-forum/).\n\nThis
  was a terrific experience. In addition to planning our expansion into the UK, this
  trip served as an eye opener as to how far ahead the UK is regarding tech-friendly
  financial regulation.\n\n![featured - London - Bank & Bus](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4avdnhRwpyKyAU4oUCyemk/480e23461445a83b07928082cce37f4c/featured_london-bank-bus.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Open Data\n\nFirst and foremost UK banks are well down the track of the [Open Banking](http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/uks-open-banking-revolution-has-lessons-for-australia-20170424-gvr87m#)
  initiative, which mandates that all banks give customers (and fintechs) access to
  their data through a common set of [APIs](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).
  Some of the work is already complete, with the ultimate deadline in 2018.\n\nIf
  bank data and APIs bore you, just know this obliterates one of the most important
  barriers to competition in financial services. If you’ve struggled to set up a portfolio
  on Sharesight, this regulation would make that process super easy. The end result
  would function like our [Broker Import](https://help.sharesight.com/importing-your-trading-history-directly-from-your-broker/)
  feature, but for **all** investment accounts from **all** institutions -- shares,
  cash, super, platform products, etc.\n\nThese APIs will power the Sharesight UK
  solution, and we can’t wait to get started.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"

  charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n## Fintech-friendly regulation\n\nThe UK (especially
  the city of London) understands how important financial services are to the economy
  and they’ve fully embraced financial technology. Because of London’s diversity and
  talent pool, its location, and because they take a global outlook from day one,
  they have a distinct advantage over every other city in the world including New
  York and San Francisco. Brexit only seems to add to their sense of urgency in terms
  of extending their lead in fintech-friendly regulation and taxation.\n\nSome of
  the investor and startup friendly regulations include:\n\n- 25% research and development
  tax credit.\n- EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme): 30% tax credit for individual
  investors, no capital gains tax after 3 years of ownership, and generous loss relief,
  up to nearly 100% of the initial investment.\n- SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment
  Scheme): similar to the above but with 50% tax credit, plus capital gains reinvestment
  relief.\n- A planned 17% corporate tax rate.\n- Robust FCA (Financial Conduct Authority)
  sandbox with 70+ current participants.\n\nLondon’s crowdfunding market is mainstream
  enough to support mass market ad campaigns -- the Tube is plastered with equity
  crowdfunding ads touting the latest campaigns.\n\nThe UK now has two fully operational
  startup banks providing a legitimate alternative to traditional high street brick
  and mortar branches. One, Starling Bank, got up and running within a year. This
  \ demonstrates the robustness of the UK fintech market. \n\n## Aussie fintechs\n\nThe
  nine companies on the trade delegation represented Australia exceptionally well.
  Although Australia is a more challenging market from which to build a startup, these
  constraints have arguably made us scrappier and more creative. I didn’t see any
  discernible talent gap between UK and Australian fintechs.\n\nSharesight was joined
