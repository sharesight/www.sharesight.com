  You might already be aware of our [knowledge base](https://help.sharesight.com) and [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/sharesightltd), but did you know you can find answers to your queries from inside your [Sharesight](/) portfolio? Here’s how:

  ## Search the Knowledge Base
  The Help tab within your Sharesight portfolio is designed to guide you to the answers to your questions and provide useful tips for getting the most out of Sharesight. We’re confident that our extensive knowledge base will help solve the vast majority of your Sharesight-related questions.

  Using the knowledge base search is easy. From the Help tab, simply search for your topic in the search bar. Should you not find the answer to your question, or if the specific help content does not appear, simply follow step 2 in the screenshot below and browse to the Help site directly to read further.

  ## Contact Customer Support
  One of the many benefits of [upgrading to a paid plan](/pricing/) is the ability for Investor, Expert and Pro plan clients to receive personalised email support from our team in Sydney. If you’re not finding your answer within the knowledge base search detailed above, or you have a specific question about your account or invoice, you may opt to email our customer support team directly. To do so, simply click on the “Contact Customer Support” button within the Help tab. Clicking on the button will open a window where you can write your query and send it to our support team.

  ### A couple things to keep in mind when emailing our support team:

  - In order to serve you as efficiently as possible, please provide as much information as possible. Attach a screenshot or file if this helps clarify your issue.

  - We will do our best to respond to you ASAP (typically within 1-2 business days).

  ## Post on the Community Forum
  The [Community Forum](https://community.sharesight.com) provides a way to connect with other Sharesight customers, learn handy tips and tricks, and to take a deep dive into the more nuanced areas of portfolio administration, such as complex corporate actions.

  Also, if you’re on a Free plan, you may post your questions or feedback to the Community Forum and we’ll do our best to respond in a timely manner. You may find that other Sharesight customers lend you a hand before we do!

  ### Just a couple things to keep in mind when posting to the forum:

  - Please search for your question before creating a new topic, as it’s possible that your question has already been posed (and answered) in the forum.

  - All posts in the forum are public and can be viewed by other Sharesight clients and Sharesight staff, so do not share sensitive information in your post.
