:title: Over 200,000 global investors track their portfolios on Sharesight
:content: "We are excited to announce that Sharesight has reached over 200,000 global
  users!\n\nFor those who remember, it was not long ago that we announced our [150,000
  user ](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-passes-150000-users-worldwide/)[milestone](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-passes-150000-users-worldwide/).
  \n\nSince then, markets around the world have continued to experience a whirlwind
  of activity and an influx of new investors. Alongside this heightened market activity,
  we have also seen a surge of new users at Sharesight. And thanks to Sharesight’s
  award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features, we now have over **200,000 empowered investors** in
  **103 countries** tracking more than **2.5 million holdings** with Sharesight. \n\n![200k

  A brief history of Sharesight\n\nFrom our beginnings in 2007 to becoming a powerful
  portfolio tool trusted by experienced investors around the world, there has been
  plenty to celebrate at Sharesight. For example, there was our first paying user
  in 2008; expanding our user base to 50 countries by 2017; and just last year reaching
  150,000 users from over 100 different countries. \n\n![Sharesight timeline to 200k
  users 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/30KJyi54TFFD75RJeVrkSb/ba361c77a639273a099e1165cc3e0427/Sharesight_timeline_to_200k_users_1.jpg?w=950)\n\nNow
  is an equally exciting time for Sharesight, with rapid growth in our user base as
  well as the expansion of our teams in Australia and New Zealand. \n\n\"As a bootstrapped
  company from New Zealand, it took us a while to reach [100,000 users](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-hits-100000-users/),
  yet only 18 months to get from 100,000 to 200,000,\" says Sharesight CEO Doug Morris.
  \n\n\"We attribute this rapid growth to the significant investments we’ve made in
  our product and marketing teams following a successful capital raising in early
  2020. This scale of growth has continued to increase in 2021, and we expect this
  trend to continue as investors look to our portfolio tracking tool to help them
  make better decisions about their investments.\"\n\n## What’s in store for 2021?\n\nCurrently,
  Sharesight supports **179 brokers**, **83 currencies** and countless **global markets**,
  with the goal to continue expanding the Sharesight ecosystem and improving the user
  experience for investors across the world. \n\n\"We have big plans for our core
  offering for Australian and New Zealand customers while we build out our product
  for investors worldwide,\" says Doug. \n\n\"We have definitely seen significant
  growth in the number of Australian users tracking their portfolio with Sharesight,
  but we are also quickly gaining traction with global investors. There has been a
  large influx of users from the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and the UK specifically,
  and we are working on further expanding our offering to reflect this.\"\n\n## Looking
  forward to the next 200,000 \n\nAchieving more than 200,000 global users is something
  we’re very proud of, and we would like to thank all of our loyal users for helping
  us reach this goal. As an independent and trusted portfolio tracking software, it
  is our goal to empower our users to become better investors, and we look forward
  to welcoming new users from around the world. \n\nWhy track your investments with
