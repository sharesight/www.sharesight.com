:title: 4 reasons SMSF trustees should be tracking dividends
:content: "Investing in dividend-paying stocks through a __self-managed super fund
  (SMSF)__ is a common strategy adopted by trustees, particularly when these dividends
  include franking credits that carry potential tax advantages. For SMSFs in the drawdown
  phase, dividend stocks can also be an attractive source of extra income in retirement.
  However, it is important to remember that with dividends come tax implications,
  and SMSF trustees need to track their dividends not only for tax purposes, but also
  to monitor their expected future dividend income and to get the complete picture
  of their investment portfolio performance. \n\nThis article will explain the 4 reasons
  why SMSF trustees should be tracking dividends, and how using a portfolio tracker
  like Sharesight can help save SMSF trustees time and money running their SMSF.\n\n![Why
  SMSF trustees should track dividends](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6HeMUeNCNJdEI2Yrv53LPF/9443e4066852582125818bc171d82441/Why_SMSF_trustees_should_track_dividends.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  1. Your broker doesn’t give you the information you need\n\nManually tracking your
  dividends can be a tedious and time-consuming process, especially because you can’t
  get the information you need from your broker. With **dividend payouts** for example,
  listed companies, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and managed funds outsource the responsibility
  of tracking who owns shares and who is paid dividends to any of the six Australian
  share registries. This means that in order to record your payouts, you will either
  have to painstakingly sort through stacks of paper statements, access multiple online
  registries, or a combination of both. \n\nUnfortunately, even if you have your dividends
  deposited into your brokerage account, the broker will not be able to calculate
  the **dividend yield** from it because they have no visibility on the source of
  the cash. Without using a portfolio tracking software, you will need to calculate
  your dividend yield manually, which can be complex and subject to inaccuracy, especially
  if you have a large portfolio. \n\nWith Sharesight, however, dividends and distributions
  are [automatically tracked in your portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/),
  as shown in the screenshot below. This means SMSF trustees can spend less time on
  tedious portfolio admin, and more time focusing on their investment decisions. \n\n![Track

  Sharesight automatically records all of your dividend payments and shows their impact
  on your returns. </small>\n\n## 2. Franking credits impact your dividend income\n\n**Franking
  credits** can be a real asset for SMSF trustees. Received during an SMSF’s accumulation
  phase, franking credits can offset the tax payable on dividends, and can be used
  in general to reduce or eliminate taxes paid on SMSF income such as capital gains
  and rental income. This makes stocks with fully franked dividends a popular choice
  for SMSF portfolios. It is important, however, for SMSF trustees to understand the
  impact of franking credits on dividend income and how this affects their **tax returns**.
  \n\nManually calculating the tax implications of franking credits can be a time-consuming
  process. Once again, looking at the bank account the share registry deposits dividends
  to will be of no help, because it only lists the net amount paid. The share registry
  can provide you with the information you need, but you will still likely need to
  access multiple registries to create a portfolio-wide tax picture. \n\nSharesight
  helps SMSF trustees avoid this long-winded process by [automatically recording franking
  credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/)
  and clearly differentiating between the **net dividend** and the **tax credits**,
  as can be seen in the screenshot below. This makes it easy for SMSF trustees to
  calculate the taxable income on their investments, without the hassle of trying
  to chase down and verify this information at tax time. \n\n![Dividends paid Sharesight

  Sharesight automatically tracks dividends on holdings, clearly showing the impact
  of franking credits on dividend income. </small>\n\n## 3. DRPs affect your cost
  base\n\nSome SMSF trustees choose to take advantage of **dividend reinvestment plans
  (DRPs)** as a way of growing wealth in their portfolio while avoiding costly brokerage
  fees. Unfortunately, reinvested dividends can make it complicated to calculate a
  portfolio’s returns due to their impact on a holding’s **cost base**. \n\nBecause
  DRPs are managed by share registries, this means brokers have no visibility into
  reinvested dividends, leaving it up to the investor to keep track of them. DRPs
  can be a pain to track manually because when dividends are reinvested, shares are
  purchased at the current market price (sometimes at a discounted rate). This means
  that the cost base and amount invested is always fluctuating, which will have an
  impact on **capital gains tax (CGT)** should you ever wish to sell your shares,
  not to mention the added layer of complexity in tracking your returns.\n\nWith Sharesight,
  investors can [automatically track reinvested dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/),
  as seen in the screenshot below, including the ability to [track residual dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-drp-residual-balances/).
  This gives investors the freedom to enable DRPs on their investments without having
  to worry about the admin involved in tracking fluctuating cost bases for their portfolio.

  Investors can easily track reinvested dividends by switching on Sharesight’s Auto
  Dividend Reinvestment feature. </small>\n\n## 4. You need to view dividend income
  at a glance\n\nFinally, for SMSF trustees who plan to rely on dividend income in
  their retirement, it is important to be able to view dividend income at a glance.
  Using a solution like Sharesight, not only is it easy to track dividends as they
  are paid, but you can also track the value of dividends that have been announced
  using the [Future Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-monthly-dividend-income-from-your-investments/),
  pictured below. This can be a useful way for SMSF trustees to see their expected
  income from investments and prepare plans to reinvest funds or extract the income
  for living expenses. \n\n![SMSF Future Income Report Sharesight 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/19XNSfheTd14WRAOjVIBTA/b83cdeb1fa14a78f1a6873aed66bd116/SMSF_Future_Income_Report_Sharesight_3.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
  Sharesight’s Future Income Report displays expected upcoming dividends and interest
  payments based on a user’s current portfolio. </small>\n\n## Track your SMSF with
  Sharesight\n\nOverall, using a portfolio tracker like Sharesight can be extremely
  valuable for SMSF trustees, as it gives you the ability to track the performance
  of both SMSF and personal investment portfolios to give you the complete investment
  picture of *all of your investments in one place.*\n\nPlus, with **automated dividend
  income tracking**, including the ability to track **franking credits**, Sharesight
  makes it easy to calculate the dividend income generated from your investments.\n\nThis
  significantly lessens the time SMSF trustees need to spend searching for records
  and making manual calculations. Combined with Sharesight’s powerful tax reporting
  built for the needs of SMSF investors, trustees have more time to focus on making
  investment decisions and planning for their retirement. \n\n[Sign up for a free
