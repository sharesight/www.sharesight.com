:title: Greetings from the Brisbane Xero Roadshow
:url_slug: greetings-from-brisbane
:content: |-
  We love heading to Brisbane. The weather’s great, the people are friendly, and Queensland teems with accountants and financial advisers. It’s always interesting to see the difference in perspectives on the financial services market from one Aussie state to the next. Queenslanders never fail to strike us as a lot who simply rolls up their sleeves and gets stuff done. We like that.

  ![Brisbane Xero Roadshow](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2P6f6PVzIsGiM0ScmYMWIU/ee0fb406f0ddb1ef63b2894410e4d9a2/Brisbane.png?w=950)

  In addition to meeting with a handful of strategic clients (and prospects), we pitched our tent on the first leg of the Xero Roadshow. What a turnout! Nearly 400 accountants, bookkeepers, and financial advisers came to learn about Xero and meet a select group of add-on partners.

  Our expo stand was inundated after Xero used a [Cashbook + Sharesight](/xero/) example as an ideal (and mission-critical) process for financial advisers. There is no other tool in the industry that brings that level of automation to advisers, whilst allowing them to stay in constant contact with their clients through our “share access” feature. Considering most industrial-strength investment platforms only spit out one report per month (!!), Xero and Sharesight bring a whole new level of transparency and communication to the game.

  Most advisers we spoke with couldn’t believe how cost effective [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) is as well. They couldn’t believe our pricing starts at $12 per month. As one adviser told it, he’d be “crazy” to recommend anything other than the most cost-effective way to invest. Gone are the days of impenetrable bank-aligned vertical integration. Sharesight’s tracking and reporting functionality is a part of that story.

  We were also happy to have the chance to chat to the other selected add-on partners like [enableHR](https://www.enablehr.com.au), [Fathom](https://www.fathomhq.com), [Spotlight](https://www.spotlightreporting.com), [Receipt Bank](https://www.receipt-bank.com), and [Invitbox](https://www.invitbox.com). We might just connect to some of these add-ons directly one day. More on this in the future...
