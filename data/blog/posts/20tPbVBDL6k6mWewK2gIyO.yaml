:title: 8 tips to get your portfolio on track today
:content: "Consumer culture demands that certain times of the year are *the* time
  to buy specific things we <del>need</del> want. This relentless conditioning by
  retailers isn’t unique to one country.\n\nAustralians buy cars at EOFY and the Brits
  queue up for clothes on Boxing Day. Growing up in the States, I recall an endless
  stream of commercials for President’s Day mattress sales (bizarre, but true). Back
  then \"zero money down and no payments for 18 months\" was too complex a financial
  concept for a kid to grasp. Thirty years later I’ve come to realise it’s a dubious
  technique to encourage people to finance things they can’t afford.\n\n**What if
  we looked at these annual milestones differently? What if we maximised the money
  we save rather than justifying ways to spend it?**\n\nIn Australia alone, [60% of
  adults own an investment](https://www.asx.com.au/documents/resources/2017-asx-investor-study.pdf)
  according to the ASX. Of those 11M people, almost a third own shares directly. But
  how effectively has this money been put to work?\n\n> Getting your investment portfolio
  on the right track today creates an outsized impact on the gains you’ll realise
  in the future.\n\nEven though Australia has a high rate of per capita investment,
  I suspect a good portion of it is poorly managed.\n\nWhile the superannuation system
  mandates that people invest, it also creates a lazy, overpriced marketplace. A self-managed
  superannuation fund ([SMSF](/blog/smsfs-up-20-since-2012/)) can be an investor’s
  best friend, but how to explain that over [26% of SMSF funds sit in cash](https://www.ato.gov.au/About-ATO/Research-and-statistics/In-detail/Super-statistics/SMSF/Self-managed-super-fund-quarterly-statistical-report---June-2016/?page=3#SMSFannualdata),
  with another 30% dangerously overweight local shares?\n\nHere are eight principles
  to get your portfolio on the right track:\n\n![featured - 8 principles to invest
  by](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/tKiChi86TmGsQOcgIEYiM/00539094f348ef81f69386820024be46/featured_8-principles-to-invest-by.png?w=950)\n\n##
  1 - Confirm the value of your assets\nIf I asked you what your online brokerage
  account plus superannuation plus employee shares are worth, could you give me an
  accurate figure?\n\nTreating your investments like a savings account is a mistake
  because even a healthy, growing balance might be a red herring.\n\nA singular balance
  figure can be elusive due to the complex data plumbing behind the financial services
  industry, but if you don't know what you're working with, chances are you've already
  designated this to the too hard basket.\n\nIf you’re already tracking your holdings
  using [Sharesight](/), you can cross this item off the list. Otherwise follow our
  guide on [how to get set up your share portfolio](/blog/5-easy-steps-to-get-organised-at-eofy/).
  You only need the most basic of information to get started. An accurate opening
  balance is the first step towards becoming a successful investor.\n\n## 2 - Calculate
  the performance of your portfolio\n\nDo you remember doing compound interest calculations
  manually in economics class? Not fun. Calculating the true performance of an investment
  is really hard, let alone for an entire portfolio. While price to price calculations
  are simple, and charting tools ubiquitous, annualising them to add real-life context
  and to compare to alternative options is difficult.\n\n> If you’re tracking your
  portfolio in a [spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/),
  I guarantee you’ve made an error. Even if you do hold a CFA degree, you’re ignoring
  one of the most basic principles: the time value of money. \n\nUnfortunately if
  you’re relying on your broker for this information, you’re not much better off.
  It’s important to understand [why your broker’s performance numbers are useless](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/).\n\nDividends
  add yet another level of complexity. Last year the ASX 200 generated almost 7% in
  dividend income. How do you track the dividend impact on your return, or if you’ve
  opted in to a [dividend reinvestment plan](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)?\n\nAnd
  while it might be fun to debate its market impact, Amazon’s acquisition of Whole
  Foods won’t fit neatly in cell ‘Sheet2!Q17’ in your precious Excel spreadsheet.
  That’s because accounting for [corporate actions](/blog/corporate-actions/) is not
  something that lends itself well to manual record-keeping. This was made all too
  clear to me recently when [a corporate action seriously tripped me up](/blog/corporate-actions-and-your-investment-performance/).\n\nAs
  you can see, manually tracking portfolio performance is tricky and time-consuming.
  Better to outsource it to a purpose-built product and focus on investment ideas
  instead.\n\n## 3 - Consider what else you could have done with your money\n\nEverybody
  wants to beat the benchmark. That’s a given. But to fully embrace benchmarking is
  to honestly evaluate opportunity cost and use it to inform your investing decisions.\n\nThe
  market is on an eight year bull run. It won’t last. This demands that you keep a
  close eye on your performance and consider a plan B. You might have a defensive
  portfolio in mind, or look to an index to weather a bear market.\n\n![Benchmarking
  - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/XlIIqxYeaGka0IwciiGUE/1d38ddbb9e43eaa0798d45b1b50b2eed/featured_benchmarking.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  popularity of ETFs, for example, means you can actually invest in the benchmark,
  or any combination of benchmarks for that matter. The choice between active and
  passive investing is not binary. Savvy investors are using ETFs to get exposure
  to niche asset classes and run a “core/satellite” approach. And from there, [portfolio
  benchmarking](/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/) provides a true apples-to-apples
  comparison.\n\n## 4 - Understand the true drivers of your performance\n\nWas it
  the market as a whole that contributed to your gains, or a specific sector? Can
  you point the smart investment decisions you made, or are you just a boat on a rising
  tide?\n\nThe S&P 500 and the ASX 200 both returned about 18% over the past 12 months
  -- terrific results, but due to different phenomena.\n\nFor the S&P 500, tech companies
  have been on an absolute tear (until recently) and now comprise over 10% of the
  index’s market cap. The “FAANGs” (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google)
  explain much of the US market’s strong performance.\n\n![screencapture - sharesight
  public portfolio - faang](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/57eDbrSAmQSo6gaaoMokcA/25e4297337aeca424381187debcfbac5/screencapture-sharesight-public-portfolios-faang.png?w=950)\n\n\nIn
  Australia, bank shares and traditional financial services companies generated most
  of the the local index’s performance. Macquarie, NAB, ANZ, IOOF, and BT are all
  up over 30% in the past year, including dividends. Even better were some of the
  resource companies, with South32 and Fortescue up over 60%.\n\nOne way to help decipher
  your return is by applying [Factset-powered groupings](/blog/updated-industry-classification-data/)
  to your portfolio. If you want more flexibility, create your own investment categories
  using [custom groups](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/).\n\nOnce your portfolio matches
  your worldview, you’ll want to decompose your return profile. Here’s [how I do this
  with my own portfolio](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/).\n\n##
  5 - Determine how much you’re paying to invest\n\nFees are a necessary evil for
  all investors. Our research shows that a self-directed investor may sacrifice as
  much as 20% of their total return to fees every year. If you’re paying for advice
  and relying on expensive platforms, that jumps to 50% of your take home gains!\n\nOnce
  you’ve connected your online broker to Sharesight, we’ll automatically track the
  fees you pay each time you trade. Once you begin treating Shareight as your investing
  source of truth, it’s easy to switch to a low-cost broker like our partner [CMC
  Stockbroking](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/stockbroking).\n\nIf you prefer professional
  management, the range of ETFs is growing rapidly. These are far cheaper than managed
  funds, and you can find an ETF proxy for most fund strategies.\n\n> A self-directed
  investor may sacrifice as much as 20% of their total return to fees every year.
  If you’re paying for advice and relying on expensive platforms, that jumps to 50%
  of your take home gains!\n\nIf you’re keen to use managed funds, check out ASX [mFund](https://www.asx.com.au/mfund/)
  or [uXchange](https://uxchange.com.au). These offer ways to cut-down on the transaction
  and administration costs associated with unlisted funds. Remember to research the
  manager’s fee (ICR), however, as Australia has some of the most expensive managed
  funds in the world.\n\n## 6 - Keep an eye on interest rates\n\nI’ve never experienced
  a high interest rate environment in my adult life, which means I’m not prepared
  for what rising rates will do to my portfolio. It also means that I’ve never paid
  too much attention to bonds, fixed interest, or term deposits because their yield
  has always been so poor.\n\nHistory tells us that rates have to go up eventually.
  Where did all the money go that central banks printed post GFC? Interest rates should
  have a significant impact on share prices -- especially bank shares due to their
  dependency on the housing market.\n\nI subscribe to [Grant’s Interest Rate Observer](https://www.grantspub.com)
  and keep an eye on the research that [PIMCO](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/insights/?r=Individual&l=United%20States&s=true&lang=en-us),
  a well-respected fixed income fund manager publishes.\n\n## 7 - Listen to the ideas
  of others\n\nPeople overexpose their portfolios to industries they know (i.e. work
  in) and suffer from home country bias. My portfolio, whilst minimally exposed to
  Australia, is certainly overweight in technology stocks because my wife and I both
  work in the industry.\n\nI subscribe to Morningstar’s [US](https://www.morningstar.com)
  and [Australian](https://www.morningstar.com.au) websites. While their value-based
  model doesn’t produce many buy recommendations in a bull market, their fair value
  metrics and economic moat scoring are still useful for assessing companies on a
  holistic, long-term basis. Plus, they have loads of analytics on funds and ETFs.\n\nAn
  ETFs that tracks Morningstar’s “Wide Moat” stocks kept pace with the S&P 500 in
  the past year, but has returned 24% annualised since it launched in late 2007.\n\nI
  also pay for Motley Fool in the [US](https://www.fool.com) and [Australia](https://www.fool.com.au).
  They do have a particular marketing style, but their underlying stock recommendations
  are insightful, high conviction, and transparent. They focus relentlessly on ideas,
  which means their analysts are always on the hunt in any market environment.\n\nI’ve
  built Motley Fool’s Dividend Investor portfolio in Sharesight. Annualised, over
  three years their picks have returned 12% compared to the ASX 200’s 8%, including
  dividends.\n\n![logos - research providers](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/89bZinSvSwKeCmqCoE2om/3ae0fc61b030217d36443422a1070b93/logos_research.png?w=950)\n\nTheir
  pick of Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API) generated a 137% annualised return,
  while G8 Education yielded a whopping 11.5% of dividend income (they’ve since recommended
  selling these positions).\n\nSome of the most respected fund managers publish their
  own research as well. If you’re curious about a local strategy or an overseas market,
  use Morningstar to find out who the best managers are and check out their websites.
  Most will have a “News & Insights” section.\n\n[Platinum](https://www.platinum.com.au/Insights-Tools/The-Journal)
  produces some of Australia’s best commentary while [Oakmark](https://www.oakmark.com/News.htm),
  based on the US publishes great insights -- they were recently named the international
  equity manager of the year by Morningstar.\n\nIt also pays to read up on macro investment
  themes and policy. [Firstlinks](/partners/firstlinks/) produces a weekly newsletter
  that is packed with terrific content.\n\n## 8 - Tend your portfolio like a gardener\n\nFinally,
  take a long-term approach. Setup your portfolio to succeed based on what will happen
  in the future and be patient. Think about how much time you’re realistically willing
  to spend managing your investments. “Analysis paralysis” and too much turnover will
  both kill your return.\n\n![screenshot - portfolio alert settings](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2E5bYrC5gM66E4AkGi2YQC/dbeff6e3886fb9e240c5a3a0e61fe4a9/screenshot_portfolio-alert-settings.png?w=950)\n\nTake
  the time to do your research and stay organised as your dividends tumble in. Set
  price alerts in advance and think hard about when to take money out of the market.
  Even a losing investment is not a total waste -- if you’re on top of it you can
  [apply the capital losses to your tax bill](/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/).\n\n###
