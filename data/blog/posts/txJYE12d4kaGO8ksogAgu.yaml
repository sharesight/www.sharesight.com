:title: New and improved Sharesight features in 2017
:content: "2017 was a busy year for [Sharesight](/) - we celebrated [our tenth birthday](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesights-10-year-fintech-journey/),
  we were nominated for and won a number of awards, and we added a suite of new and
  improved features in order to improve Sharesight and make tracking the true performance
  of your share portfolio easier than ever.\n\nLet’s dive into the details of the
  key Sharesight enhancements in 2017:\n\n## Contribution Analysis Report\n\nWe launched
  our [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  feature to clients on [Expert](https://www.sharesight.com/pricing/) and [Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/)
  plans. The Contribution Analysis Report allows investors to analyse the drivers
  behind a portfolio’s performance, be they stock selection, [asset allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/),
  or exposure to certain countries, sectors, or industries.\n\nWe further enhanced
  the Contribution Analysis Report feature in October, allowing the report to be run
  across a [Consolidated View of multiple portfolios](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/new-functionality-for-consolidated-views/).\n\n##
  20-minute delayed pricing\n\nWe launched both [20-minute delayed pricing for NZX
  holdings](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/introducing-20-minute-delayed-pricing-for-nzx-holdings/)
  in addition to [20-minute delayed pricing for ASX holdings](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/introducing-20-minute-delayed-pricing-for-asx-holdings/)
  to allow investors to track performance throughout the day in near-real time.\n\nThis
  means that the [add holding](https://help.sharesight.com/setting-up-your-holdings/),
  [add/edit trades](https://help.sharesight.com/recording-trades-dividends-and-adjustments/)
  and [Share Checker](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-can-i-quickly-check-share-performance-and-dividends/)
  screens now display the latest 20-minute delayed intraday price we’ve received from
  both the NZX and ASX!\n\n## New Partner Centre\n\n![featured - Sharesight Partner
  Centre](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1D1dDdQMOYi66U082OSSYU/e95709f462211deb79ca004d08a0bc69/featured_sharesight-partner-centre.jpg?w=950)\n\n2017
  was a massive year for Sharesight Partner news. Underpinning our commitment to supporting
  the vibrant ecosystem of Sharesight Partners, we [launched the Sharesight Partner
  Centre](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/introducing-the-sharesight-partner-centre/).
  It showcases our industry-leading data and research partners, and lets you easily
  find innovative brokers, robo-advisers, accountants and advisors that can help you
  on your investment journey.\n\n## Canadian mutual fund support\n\nWe launched a
  massive addition to our portfolio database: [over 38,000 Canadian mutual funds were
  added](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-canadian-mutual-funds-with-sharesight/),
  with 10 years of historical prices plus ongoing price and distribution data updated
  automatically. \n\nThis is in addition to the nearly [10,000 ASX and NZX managed
  funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/managed-funds-live-on-sharesight/) available
  on Sharesight since 2014.\n\n## New and improved help website\n\n![featured - sharesight
  help website](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/50TCqFvaJOE2YCYq4yEc2k/b846778e7b319321f89da8eae79c158b/featured_sharesight-help-website-3.png?w=950)\n\nWe
  launched our [new help website](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/new-and-improved-sharesight-help-documentation-website/),
  with a fresh design that works across desktop and mobile devices, localised content
  for various regions, and an easy-to-use search function. \n\nThe new help website
  has been regularly updated with new help content since launch, with help pages specific
  to your region, including help on our dedicated tax reports that conform to New
  Zealand’s Inland Revenue Department (IRD), Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and
  Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules (with more countries on the way).\n\n## New tools
  to import your trading history into Sharesight from more places\n\nWe built tools
  that make it easy to import your trading history from:\n\n- [Google Finance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-your-google-finance-portfolio-into-sharesight/)
  \n- [Yahoo Finance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/easily-import-your-yahoo-finance-portfolio-into-sharesight/)\n-
  [Canadian broker Questrade](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-your-questrade-trades-into-sharesight/)
  (Massive news for Canadian investors!)\n\n## Sharesight20 trading insights\n\nWe
  launched the [Sharesight20 weekly trading snapshot](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/get-weekly-sharesight20-asx-nzx-trading-snapshots/)
  - a weekly update of the top 20 shares traded by the Sharesight userbase on the
  NZX and ASX markets over the previous 7 days.\n\nWe also launched a deeper dive
  into the news and corporate actions driving the activity across the top 20 shares
  traded in these markets with a [monthly Sharesight20 trading update](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20-october-trading-snapshot/).\n\n##
  We made it easier to manage corporate actions\n\nSharesight handles the vast majority
  of corporate actions – such as dividends and share splits – automatically. But when
  two companies merge into one (commonly known as a takeover or merger) it can mean
  a bit of manual portfolio admin for investors. To help alleviate that pain, we built
  the the [Merge Holding feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-merge-holding-feature/).\n\n##
  More sources for company news in your portfolio\n\nIn addition to Google News and
  [Livewire updates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/livewire-market-insights-within-your-portfolio/),
  we partnered with [Firstlinks](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/firstlinks/)
  to bring their exclusive investing insights [directly into your Sharesight portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cuffelinks-insights-now-available-within-sharesight/).\n\n##
  Public Portfolios\n\nWe launched [Public Portfolios](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-sharesight-public-portfolios/),
  which allows sharing of a “Sharesight light” portfolio that can be viewed by anyone
  -- no login required. These will be  used to track the upcoming [Sharesight 2018
  stock picking competition](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/).
  Stay tuned for more details!\n\n## Here’s to an even bigger 2018!\n\nThese are just
  a few of the new and improved Sharesight features from 2017. We also made a number
  of behind the scenes improvements, such as moving to an Amazon Aurora Database,
  and improving the speed of performance calculations by almost 5x in some cases.\n\nWe’ve
  got a pipeline full of new features planned for 2018. We thank you for your support
  in 2017 and look forward to bringing these to you in the new year.\n\n### Further
