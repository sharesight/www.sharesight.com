  The main focus for February was the launch of our revamped [plans and pricing](https://www.sharesight.com/pricing/), including additional portfolios and expanded reporting for some plan types. The Sharesight development team also worked on additional broker support as well as technical enhancements to our [Xero integration](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/) and the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).
