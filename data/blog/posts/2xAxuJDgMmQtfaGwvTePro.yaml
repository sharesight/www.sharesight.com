:content: "Each year, Sharesight20 looks back at the top 20 buy and sell trades made
  by Sharesight users throughout the year. Welcome to the 2020 edition of the Sharesight20ASX
  snapshot, where we explore the top trades users have made in stocks on the ASX this
  year, plus the market-moving news behind these stocks.\n\n## Sharesight20 top 20
  ASX stocks traded in 2020\n\n![Top20 ASX YTD](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4WpaC5QJO0OshlMbuiDCmr/461b9c3a2aa0372d7c84dcb270ae4c23/Top20__ASX_YTD.png?w=950)\n\nThis
  yearly Sharesight20ASX snapshot saw the rise of buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) stocks
  Afterpay (ASX: APT) and Zip Co (ASX: Z1P), both of which were bolstered by the growing
  adoption of BNPL methods driven by Australia's economic downturn and a shift to
  online shopping amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional blue chip stocks such as
  the big four banks were also heavily traded by Sharesight users, in a tumultuous
  year for the firms that resulted in massive fines, plummeting share prices and COVID-related
  losses. \n\nOverall, it was a challenging year for the ASX, with steep losses during
  the height of Australia’s lockdown in March. Share prices have since recovered however,
  with the index trending towards pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLet’s look at the news behind
  the key stocks in this year’s snapshot:\n\n### Zip Co (ASX: Z1P)\n\n* **January:**
