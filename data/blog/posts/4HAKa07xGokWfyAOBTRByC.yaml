:title: EOFY checklist for Australian investors
:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not
  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant to obtain
  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nWith the Australian FY20/21 financial
  year rapidly drawing to a close, the month of June presents one last opportunity
  to get on top of your investments and understand what the tax implications are —
  before it’s too late.\n\nFor tax purposes, each financial year is seen as a snapshot
  in time used to assess the tax payable by individual Australians. Because of this,
  the timing of *when* investment income is earned, or when investors realise capital
  gains has important tax implications.\n\nThis means prepared investors, armed with
  the full picture of their investment situation, are in a position to decide whether
  to bring forward the sale of particular investments to realise a capital gain or
  loss in the current financial year (to offset existing losses or gains), or to hold
  off a sale to fall in the subsequent financial year.\n\nAre you a prepared investor?
  If not, there’s still time to paint the full picture of your investments and make
  the most of the opportunities it presents this financial year — here’s how:\n\n1.
  [Take stock of your stocks (and unlisted investments)](#take-stock-of-your-stocks-and-unlisted-investments)\n2.
  [Paint your financial picture](#paint-your-financial-picture)\n3. [Put yourself
  in the best tax position](#put-yourself-in-the-best-tax-position)\n\n![EOFY checklist
  for Australian investors](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6FTh7vSGMHQhxsuPHPUL4r/7cf14388b8736ca705f863c2f1806c75/EOFY_checklist_for_Australian_investors.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Take stock of your stocks (and unlisted investments)\n\nFirst, you need to find
  out what investments you own, and the number of shares/units you own in each.\n\nYou
  could turn to your [broker](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-sharesight-from-100-brokers/)
  or fund manager for this information, and if you only own investments through a
  single entity that makes it easy. But for investors who trade across multiple brokers,
  or who also own [unlisted investments](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/the-essential-guide-to-investing-in-unlisted-property-trusts/),
  it’s best to consult Australia’s share registries (Link Market, [Computershare](https://www.sharesight.com/au/partners/computershare/)
  and Boardroom being the most common) for records of the investments you own.\n\nOnce
  you have this information, you’ll need to put it together in one place. While some
  investors build a [spreadsheet to do this, it is much easier to use Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  to track all your investments in a single place. If you don’t have a Sharesight
  account - take a second to [sign-up for a FREE account now](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  - before finishing this article.\n\n## Paint your financial picture\n\nNow you need
  to understand your income and capital gains made on your investments during the
  current financial year.\n\nShare dividend and fund distributions are often a significant
  stream of income for Australian investors, particularly among self-funded retirees.
  Records of the income paid is available by running [Sharesight’s taxable income
  report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report/).
  Once you have this information, you can easily calculate the total income received
  from dividends and distributions.\n\n![taxable-income-report-au-2020-sharesight-min](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2iL679mmX0jmn4ZVVXsVjf/3dd9cb55144789e8517b3d24867dfc08/taxable-income-report-au-2020-sharesight-min.png?w=950)\n<small>Click
  on image to enlarge</small>\n\nHave you sold investments this financial year? There
  are capital gains tax implications if you realised capital gains or losses on the
  sales. To find out, you’ll need to find the cost price of any investments sold,
  and the price / quantity sold during the year from the broker or fund manager involved.
  \n\n[Calculating the capital gains](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/)
  on investments from this point is where it starts getting more difficult, as Australia
  permits multiple methods to calculate capital gains tax on shares. Using different
  sale allocation methods such as first-in first-out (FIFO) and last-in first-out
  (LIFO) can impact the cost price of the shares sold (and thus the capital gain made)
  if multiple parcels of shares were purchased over time at different prices.\n\n![CGT
  Report - AU 2020 : Sale Allocation Methods](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7JNbwa7sbqfWjFFkpBAG7u/c1ab12fb71b18b04906c7ddebff91050/cgt-report-au-2020-sale-allocation-methods_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nFortunately,
  [Sharesight’s Capital Gains Tax Report](/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  makes calculating capital gains and losses on investments sold during the year easy.
  Built to Australian Tax Office (ATO) rules, the Capital Gains Tax Report allows
  investors to calculate the optimum sale allocation method for each holding sold
  for their individual tax position.\n\n![CGT Report - AU 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3z8ALDGJRx35zryCX1XCcc/7e7e4817698c7d51c7bef7d9972d6765/cgt-report-au-2020-sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nWhile
  optimising the choice of sale allocation methods is critical to not pay more capital
  gains tax than is required, at this point, knowing the size of your capital gains
  or losses realised during the financial year will let you make the most of the time
  left before EOFY.\n\n## Put yourself in the best tax position\n\nNow that you’ve
  got the full picture of your investments, do you know how your investments have
  performed? If you’ve made large capital gains during the year, there could be an
  opportunity to engage in [tax loss selling strategies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  before 30 June to minimise your taxable income.\n\nTax loss selling is a strategy
  where investors sell an investment at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability
  during the financial year. It’s a strategy investors can use year round, but is
  particularly useful leading up to the EOFY.\n\n### Tax loss selling example - Australian
  shares\nAn investor has recorded large capital gains during the year, but still
  holds BHP (ASX: BHP) shares in their portfolio purchased in 2018 at $370.80 per
  share. With BHP shares now valued closer to $310.20, the investor can sell their
  BHP shares during this financial year to realise the capital loss and offset the
  earlier gains from other sold shares.\n\nSharesight’s [Unrealised Capital Gains
  Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  makes it easy to model potential tax loss selling opportunities like the above in
  your portfolio. By running the [Unrealised CGT report](https://help.sharesight.com/unrealised_cgt_report/),
  investors can model potential tax loss selling opportunities across their portfolio,
  with a choice of sale allocation methods broken down by short and long term capital
  gains ([which incur different CGT discounts](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/Working-out-your-capital-gain/The-discount-method-of-calculating-your-capital-gain/))
  and unrealised capital losses.\n\n![Unrealised CGT Report - 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4lHyegznohsGicuZi1R4FJ/ab1f1817458011c91380566c785b879e/unrealised-cgt-report-2020_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nTax
  loss selling is [within the ATO rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/Capital-losses-on-shares-and-units/),
  but investors need to be mindful that the ATO does seek to prevent abuse of this
  strategy, and does not look favourably on wash trades, where investors sell just
  before EOFY to incur the tax loss, then repurchase the shares for a similar price
  early in the new year.\n\n## EOFY doesn’t have to be a nightmare\n\nWhether you’re
  working with an accountant or not, it's important to be a prepared investor. That
  means taking ownership of your investment decisions, tracking your own investment
  portfolio, and implementing strategies to ensure you aren’t paying more tax than
  necessary. Fortunately, with the proliferation of online tools — from your fund
  manager, to share registries to Sharesight — this is easier than ever.\n\n## Complete
