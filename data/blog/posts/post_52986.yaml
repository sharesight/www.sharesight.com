:title: The ten year gap in financial services technology
:url_slug: the-ten-year-gap-in-financial-services-technology
:content: "In my estimation, technology in traditional financial services lag other
  industries by about a decade. Having trouble remembering what your online life was
  like in 2006? Here's a benchmark: Facebook, Twitter, and the iPhone are each more
  than 10 years old.\n\nSure, the word [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology)
  has been all the rage the past couple of years, but it's not a good sign when the
  word \"tech\" is wrenched into a moniker to explain what the companies involved
  actually do. We don't refer to Uber as \"taxitech,\" just like we don't think of
  Airbnb as \"hoteltech.\" It just works. It's how we live.\n\nI'm not sure who coined
  the term _fintech_, but I can confidently say it's been popularised by incumbents
  who look quizzically at tech companies (including [Sharesight](/)) as a paddock
  for propeller-heads. Recently one banker asked me how things were going at the \"$2
  shop\".\n\n![10 year gap - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6IX7vAsrOEmEmS6SICO84u/3ebad33d9ebb6ae2056b09637670a3c0/featured_10-year-gap.jpg?w=950)\n\nIn
  reality, we in the fintech industry are busy testing ideas and innovative technologies
  that make everyday life better for those who depend on the [dusty realm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsOjfoA4TQ)
  of financial services. Some of us are outsiders set on challenging the banks head
  on, while others come from the industry and seek to improve it.\n\n> Every day,
  clients of financial advisers, accountants, and fund managers are finding ways to
  access their data and take matters into their own hands — for better or worse.\"\n\nA
  recent report by PwC highlighted just how much catching up financial services companies
  have to do on the tech front. According to their survey, 69% of high-net-worth individuals
  use mobile/online banking, with 40% using self-directed and execution-only investment
  services, like a low cost online broker. Of those with more than $10M, only 22%
  are \"very satisfied\" with their existing service.\n\n**That means wealthy people
  are dissatisfied and their assets are portable. That must terrify those reliant
  on vertical integration.**\n\nSo this bodes ill for professionals on the wrong side
  of technology. Every day, clients of financial advisers, accountants, and fund managers
  are finding ways to access their data and take matters into their own hands — for
  better or worse. Sure there's dissatisfaction with the banking industry, but technology
  (particularly mobile) is allowing us to do this in all other facets of life. There's
  no stopping this trend.\n\n> The truth is, the most successful fintech companies
  are the ones redefining how people are organising themselves around financial products.
  And the financial professionals who understand this have a head start.\"\n\nThis
  is not a surprise to us. While we see the best financial professionals seeking services
  like Sharesight and our family of connected products, we also talk to those that
  just don't get it. \n\nSome fintech companies are doing some really cool stuff with
  technology — blockchain, or the way our developers have applied new JavaScript frameworks
  to Sharesight, for example. But the truth is, the most successful fintech companies
  are the ones redefining how people are _organising themselves_ around financial
  products. And the financial professionals who understand this have a head start.\n\nWe've
  recently started profiling our financial adviser clients and one common thread is
  none rely on an out-of-the-box tech solution. Instead they let their clients dictate
  which apps and services they use - not just for product selection, but access too.\n\nThe
  banks who persist building or dictating the tech platforms their wealth management
  teams use may not find their client relationships totally severed. Instead, their
  assets under management won't grow, and they won't know who else is giving their
  clients advice.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Blog -- [Why does finance hate technology?](/blog/why-does-finance-hate-technology/)\n-
