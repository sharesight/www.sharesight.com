:title: How to handle the 2016 Telstra buy back
:content: "Following the sale of its investment in Autohome and the announcement of
  a $1.5 billion capital management program, Telstra recently proposed, and successfully
  completed, a $1.25 billion off-market buy back tender. \n\nTelstra gave its shareholders
  the option to offer a discount between 6-14% on the going price, as at Monday, 3rd
  October. Telstra subsequently announced that it would only buy back shares offered
  at a 14% discount. Those shareholders who held 880 shares or less, and wanted to
  participate in the offer, were required to tender all of their shares. Those with
  holdings of more than 880 shares were not required to tender their whole holding.\n\n![Featured
  - 2016 Telstra Buy Back](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4soE7oPdCUaMgIKy2kUIq4/2b58745bd6095c9dbfe96a609edc4583/featured_2016-tesltra-buy-back.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  structure of this particular buy back offer was comprised of a 'capital component'
  and 'dividend component'. The ATO advised that the 'capital component' would be
  $1.78 per share, so the 'dividend component' would be the final 'Buy Back Tender
  Price' less the 'capital component'.\n\nFollowing the close of market on Monday,
  3rd October, Telstra announced the following details regarding the buy back:\n\n__A.
  Market Price - $5.1482__ (calculated using the 'Volume Weighted Average Price' of
  Telstra ordinary shares on the ASX over the five trading days leading up to and
  including the Closing Date, calculated to four decimal places as determined by Telstra
  on Friday 30 September 2016)\n\n__B. Buy Back Discount - 14%__ (only those who tendered
  shares at a 14% discount would be bought back)\n\n__C. Buy-Back Tender Price - $4.43__
  (represents a 14% discount to the 'Market Price')\n\n__D. Capital Component - $1.78__
  (as stipulated by the ATO)\n\n__E. Dividend Component - $2.65__ (Buy-Back Tender
  Price less Capital Component)\n\n__F. CGT Value - $5.35__ (CGT Value means the market
  value of Telstra ordinary shares for capital gains tax purposes as determined in
  accordance with the Commissioner of Taxation's views set out and expressed in TD2004/22
  and PSLA 2007/9.)\n\nThe CGT value is to be used to calculate the __'Deemed Capital
  Proceeds'__, for Australian Capital Gains tax purposes. The 'Deemed Capital Proceeds'
  will be calculated as: \n\nCapital Component + (CGT Value - Buy-Back Tender Price)
  =<br>\n__D + (F - C) = $1.78 + $0.92 = $2.70__\n\n## How to handle the Telstra buy
  back in Sharesight\n\nThe flexibility of [Sharesight](/) makes accounting for the
  Telstra buy back a piece of cake. Sharesight allows users to add new dividends and
  trades, in addition to those that are automatically generated via our data feeds.\n\nIn
  the following example, we will assume an original holding of 880 TLS shares. You
  will need to adjust the quantity to correctly reflect your situation.\n\nFirstly,
  from the 'Overview' page, locate and click on your TLS holding. You will then be
  taken to the 'Holdings' page for TLS, as below:\n\n![Telstra buy back 2016 - screenshot

  the 'Holdings' page, click 'Enter a new Trade or Adjustment' within the 'All Trades
  and Adjustments' section. This will open a pop-up box from which you will enter
  the 'Sell' trade, which will account for the __'capital component'__. Select the
  'Sell' trade-type from the drop-down list. The date will be 03/10/2016. The Quantity
  will be whatever quantity of your holding was accepted and bought back by Telstra.
  The price will be $1.78 ('capital component' per share). You can leave a comment
  if required, to note that this transaction is part of the buy back. Click 'Save'
  to finalise this transaction.\n\n![Telstra buy back 2016 - screenshot #2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2SCykqbjUcyO04wcC4eGS2/5249cee52d61a2cee00695e34786e5ee/screenshot_telstra-buy-back-2016_2.png?w=950)\n\nOnce
  you've saved this trade, you will be taken back to the 'Holdings' page. You'll now
  need to click 'Enter a New Dividend' within the 'Recent Income' section. This will
  open up a new pop-up box, from which you will be able to enter details of the 'dividend
  component' as part of the offer.\n\nFor this example, we have changed both the 'Paid'
  and 'Ex' date to the 03/10/2016. Per the offer, the dividend component is fully
  franked, so leave the 'Unfranked Amount' field blank. In the 'Franked Amount' section,
  your amount will be the 'dividend component' of $2.65 x the quantity of shares accepted,
  e.g. 880 x $2.65. To work out the 'Franking Credits', use 'Franked Amount' x 30/70.
  Again, add a comment if preferred and click 'Save' to finalise this transaction.\n\n![Telstra

  on your original purchase date/s of TLS, Sharesight will identify any long term/short
  term gains, or losses, wherever applicable. Furthermore, when entering either of
  the above transactions, make sure you elect to send the data through to [Xero](/xero/),
  if required.\n\n## A note about performance vs. tax\n\nIt is important to note that
  the above steps will be correct from a performance perspective. This is the reason
  why, instead of selling at $2.70 ('deemed capital proceeds'), we have entered the
  sell as $1.78. The $1.78 'capital component' would be included in the payment you
  receive from Telstra, whereas the additional $0.92 ('deemed capital proceeds' less
  the 'capital component') only comes into play when assessing CGT.\n\nYou can easily
  amend the price of your 'Sell' transaction to $2.70 at any time, or keep it at that
  price permanently. If you decide to keep the price at $1.78, we suggest leaving
  a comment against the dividend transaction noting the absence of the $0.92 per share
  or, when exporting the [CGT Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/)
  to Excel, including a comment against the 'Sell' transaction advising to include
  an additional $0.92 per share when calculating CGT.\n\n![Telstra buy back 2016 -

  Please note: The ATO is due to release a Class Ruling toward the end of October,
  which will look at the treatment of this offer. That said, this post may be subject
  to change. Please note that we always advise you to consult your financial advisor
  or accountant regarding corporate actions, especially for tax purposes, as we are
  not authorised to provide financial advice.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Community
