  What is a stapled security?\n\nA stapled security is an investment product that
  is created when two or more securities are legally bound together and cannot be
  purchased separately. This is typical in real estate investment trusts (REITs),
  for example, where the trust will have its units stapled to companies that it is
  closely linked to. Stapled securities are most commonly found in Australia, but
  exist in markets around the world. \n\nStapled securities can be challenging to
  track, which can cost investors time and money when doing their tax return. According
  to the [ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/stapled-securities/),
  while stapled securities are dealt with as one unit, investors need to remember
  that they consist of multiple securities, each with their own cost base and distributions.
  This can make tax returns complicated, as the owner of a stapled security will need
  to include dividends from the company and distributions from the trust separately.
  Capital gains and losses will also need to be calculated separately for each unit.
  From a tax perspective, it is crucial that this information is properly recorded,
  especially where paid and ex dates for dividends are concerned, as well as the ‘trust’
  and ‘non-trust’ components of payouts. \n\n## Tracking stapled securities with Sharesight\n\nTo
  help users track their stapled securities, Sharesight now has the capability to
  differentiate stapled securities from unit trusts. Users with stapled securities
  will receive a prompt asking them to classify their payouts as trust or non-trust
  components, which ensures they can correctly [calculate capital gains and losses](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/stapled-securities/#Costbasecalculations1)
  alongside the rest of their investments, preventing them from paying more in tax
  than they need to. \n\n![image 1 stapled securities](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1ibFM6RwtXlrGyw4cBlm06/e9c0b1125d9c7e4ea2c526324fa6ec8e/image_1_stapled_securities.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
  A stapled security holding with distributions that need to be classified as trust
  or non-trust components.</small>\n\nTo review the distribution income and ensure
  the payout details are correct, simply click edit on the highlighted payment and
  adjust the values accordingly, updating ‘trust’ payouts to include only trust components,
  and creating a separate payout to track any non-trust components. \n\n**Ensuring
  these components are correct is particularly relevant for payouts with an ex date
  on one side of the financial year (before 30 June, for example) and a paid date
  on the other side of the financial year.** These details are also best updated at
  the end of the financial year, when investors receive their final statements for
  stapled security payouts. This is because while payout statements throughout the
  year may have component breakdowns, these values can change at year-end.\n\n![image

  A stapled security payout classified as a non-trust component. </small>\n\nProperly
  classifying payouts as trust and non-trust components will also ensure these payments
  appear in the correct section of Sharesight’s [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/).
  A useful feature for investors who need help with tax reporting, this report compiles
  a list of all dividends, distributions and interest payments within a selected period,
