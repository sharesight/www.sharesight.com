  Who is Magellan?\n\nEstablished in 2006, [Magellan](https://www.magellangroup.com.au/)
  is an Australian asset management firm that offers a range of listed and unlisted
  funds and trusts that invest in global equities and global listed infrastructure.
  The firm’s funds give Australian investors access to global stocks, with an investment
  strategy based on macroeconomic analysis and risk management to generate strong
  returns over the medium to long term. Magellan also provides insights through investor
  education articles, videos and audio, including CPD-accredited content. \n\n## Import
  your Magellan funds to Sharesight\n\nSharesight allows you to import your ongoing
  and historical trades in unlisted funds through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  feature, or you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading
  a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet\n\nOne
  simple way to import historical trades to Sharesight is by creating and formatting
  a [ spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1) filled
  with trades including fund APIR codes from your Magellan account.\n\n![image 1 Magellan](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1EL5JNV6W3KYzcdrBMSljf/339061578c7ddabda1cffc768365ba5f/image_1_Magellan.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio.\n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** This feature is designed primarily for ongoing
  trades, but it can also be used to fill in historical trades in your Sharesight
  portfolio. All you need to do is manually forward the Trade Confirmation Emails
  for the trades you wish to see in your portfolio, starting with the earliest trade
  you want included.\n\n## Get started with Sharesight\n\nJoin thousands of Australian
