  throughout the year. [Keeping track of your dividend income](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  can be a tedious process, but it is a necessary part of tax reporting for investors,
  not to mention an important part of calculating your portfolio’s performance. This
  blog will explain some of the different types of dividends, the pros and cons, the
  tax implications and how a dedicated portfolio tracking tool like Sharesight can
  help investors keep track of their dividend income. \n\n![What is a dividend (1)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2iEf3JcRRXMJNB71kStKTh/148fca1a6b6351957e504ebb4c3e2880/What_is_a_dividend___1_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a dividend? \n\nIf you are a shareholder of a company, they may pay you
  a dividend. A dividend is a small amount of money paid to shareholders either out
  of the company’s profit or by the company going into debt, as a reward for investing
  in the company. Not all companies pay dividends however; some companies choose to
  reinvest the profits they have made back into the company. \n\n## How do dividends
  work?\n\nWhen it has been decided and approved by the board of directors, dividends
  are then paid to every shareholder on a per unit basis, according to the following
  process:\n\n**Step 1:** The board of the company of which you are a shareholder
  discusses what should be reinvested in the company and whether a dividend should
  be paid to shareholders. If a dividend is decided, it is paid on a per-share basis.\n\n**Step
  2:** The decision is signed off by the board of directors.\n\n**Step 3:** The company
  declares the dividend. This announcement will also include the value per share and
  the date on which the dividend will be paid.\n\n**Step 4:** Shareholders receive
  their dividends.\n\n## Types of dividends\n\nThere are a variety of types of dividends
  a company may pay to its shareholders. These include:\n\n**Cash dividends:** Cash
  dividends are the most common type of dividends you may receive. A cash dividend
  is a cash payment deposited directly into your linked bank account.\n\n**Special
  dividends:** This type of dividend is not recurring like a cash dividend, but instead,
  it is a one-off payment. It is usually linked to a windfall or a large sale of assets.
  A special dividend is often larger than a cash dividend.\n\n**Scrip dividends:**
  Scrip dividends occur when a company is low on cash. A scrip dividend is an alternative
  for cash or legal tender offered to investors. This may take the form of credit
  but is most often a document that acknowledges a debt to the investor.\n\n**Property
  dividends:** These are assets provided to the investor instead of cash. Property
  dividends may take the form of the products produced by the company. The market
  value of the product is calculated and provided to the shareholder at the same value
  a cash dividend would be. \n\n**Stock dividends:** Rather than paying cash dividends,
  companies may offer their shareholders extra stocks in the company.\n\n**Dividend
  reinvestment programs (DRPs/DRIPs):** Similar to stock dividends, a DRIP program
  can give current shareholders a discount on shares and allow them to reinvest their
  cash dividends into the company.\n\n**Preferred dividends:** A preferred dividend
  is paid on preferred stock. When a company cannot pay all dividends, preferred dividend
  claims are prioritised over common stock dividends. \n\n## How often are dividends
  paid?\n\nHow often dividends are paid varies from company to company. A majority
  of companies who are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) will pay two
  dividends a year. The first dividend is paid halfway through the financial year.
  This is known as an \"interim dividend\" and is usually paid before a company's
  annual general meeting. The second dividend is known as a “final dividend”. Paid
  at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a final dividend is a percentage of
  earnings paid out after the capital expenditures and working capital. \n\nListed
  funds (ETFs) tend to pay dividends quarterly rather than semi-annually. Meanwhile,
  it isn’t uncommon for smaller companies to not pay dividends at all and instead
  reinvest their capital into the company for the shareholder’s future benefit. \"Special
  dividends\" can also be paid at any time, with a one-off payment occurring if the
  company experiences a large sale of assets or a windfall of some type.\n\n## How
  are dividends paid?\n\nWith the redistribution of a company’s profits to its shareholders,
  dividends can be paid in a variety of ways. This includes:\n\n**Dividend check:**
  This is a relatively standard practice where dividends are mailed to the shareholder.
  Dividend checks are usually mailed after the [ex-dividend date](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/ex-dividend-dates-and-their-impact-on-stock-prices-explained/),
  which is when the stock begins trading without the previously declared dividend.\n\n**Cash:**
  Cash is also a common way dividends are paid. Cash is paid into the shareholder’s
  nominated bank account at the same time as dividend checks.\n\n**Stock:** Shareholders
  may be paid in the company’s stock to the value of the dividend. Also known as [DRP/DRIP](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-dividend-reinvestment-plans/)
  (dividend reinvestment programs), being paid in stocks allows the shareholder to
  increase their investment in the company over time.\n\n## Are dividends a steady
  form of income? And are they taxable?\n\nIn Australia, any dividends you earn as
  a shareholder are considered taxable income, although this varies according to the
  country in which you live. There are two types of dividends in terms of tax in Australia;
  franked dividends and unfranked dividends. \n\n**Franked dividends:** This is a
  dividend that has a tax credit attached. Established in Australia in 1987, franked
  dividends were created to avoid shareholders paying double tax. When a shareholder
  pays tax with a franked dividend, they will only be taxed on the dividend portion,
  minus the franking credit.\n\n**Unfranked dividends:** Unfranked dividends have
  had no tax paid on them, so there are no franking credits with which to offset the
  tax you will need to pay on your dividend. \n\nIt can be complex and confusing to
  calculate taxes on your investment portfolio, and using a dedicated portfolio tracking
  tool (rather than a spreadsheet) can be revolutionary. Built specifically for self-directed
  investors, Sharesight’s [investment portfolio tax reporting](https://www.sharesight.com/au/investment-portfolio-tax/)
  can help simplify the process.\n\n## What are the pros and cons of dividends? \n\nCompanies
  that pay dividends distribute their net income amongst their shareholders. This
  extra income can be beneficial but is not always reliable. So what are the pros
  and cons of dividends?\n\n**The drawbacks of dividends:**\n\n* Dividends can be
  unpredictable. Depending on decisions made by the board of directors, you may or
  may not receive a regular dividend on your shares, meaning dividends cannot be relied
  on as a steady stream of income.\n\n* If dividends are being paid on a stock, it
  means less money is being invested back into the company, which can be disadvantageous
  for the company in the long term. Companies that reinvest their income may grow
  more rapidly and expand more than those which redistribute their net income. Therefore,
  paying dividends may indicate a company has no plans for growth.\n\n* There can
  be taxation implications associated with dividends and losses resulting from this.
  Firstly, the company pays tax on its profits. Secondly, depending on the country
  you live in, you will need to pay a differing rate of tax on the dividends you receive.\n\n**The
  benefits of dividends:**\n\n* Dividends provide you with income, even if it is not
  reliable. This is a great way to receive a return as a shareholder, without selling
  your shares. Dividends are also a form of passive income which requires no outlay
  of time and effort from you in order to earn money.\n\n* Dividends provide you with
  more money to invest. Reinvesting your dividends allows you to become an even larger
  shareholder in the company without risking money from any other part of your income.\n\n*
  Dividend income may be tax advantaged compared to capital gains on investments (varies
  by country/investment type). \n\n## How to calculate dividend per share (DPS)\n\nMany
  companies follow what is known as a consistent [dividend payout ratio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-the-dividend-payout-ratio-dpr/).
  When this is the case, the company will consistently pay a percentage of its earnings
  to shareholders in the form of dividends per share (DPS). DPS is the sum of all
  declared dividends issued by the company you are a shareholder in, paid per outstanding
  share. \n\nCompanies will declare a dividend of **X** cents per share. To calculate
  dividend per share (DPS), you will need to multiply this by the number of shares
  you hold. Manually calculating dividends and accessing all the metrics required
  to determine the dividends you will be paid can be complicated. This is where Sharesight
  can take the hassle out of tracking your investments, giving you a running list
  of all your [dividends and distributions](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  over any period of time, as well as any [upcoming (announced) dividend income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/).
  \n\n## What is the average dividend payout?\n\nThe average dividend payout varies
  between companies and between payments of dividends. The average dividend yield
  across the Australian stock market is [around 4%](https://www.firstlinks.com.au/dividend-yields-australia-high).
  This is twice the average across the globe.\n\n## Track your dividends with Sharesight\n\nKeeping
