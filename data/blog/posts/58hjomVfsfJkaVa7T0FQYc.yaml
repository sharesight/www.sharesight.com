:title: Performance of the top 20 SMSF shares in FY19/20
:content: "###### Disclaimer: Sharesight does not provide tax or investment advice.
  The buying of shares can be complex and varies by individual. Seek tax and investment
  advice specific to your situation before acting on any information in this article.\n\n*This
  piece was originally published on the [SMSF Connect website](https://smsfconnect.com/article/performance-of-the-top-20-smsf-shares-in-fy19-20).*\n\nSharesight
  is an award-winning online portfolio tracker and performance reporting tool used
  by SMSF trustees to take the admin hassle out of tracking their SMSF investments.\n\nSMSFs
  make up roughly 35% of the portfolios tracked in Sharesight by Australian investors.
  From these portfolios, we’re able to generate insights into the investment trends
  of trustees and the investments used to construct self-managed superannuation funds.\n\nTo
  help SMSF trustees compare their own portfolios to their peers, we’ve crunched the
  numbers on the 20 most commonly held shares within SMSF portfolios tracked in Sharesight,
  and how those shares have performed during the most recent financial year.\n\n![Top
  SMSF shares](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2UMkmhJFtMUcjtugsjPok5/5c969ff62121f457d4d20d59b8497d9b/Top_SMSF_shares.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  20 most held shares in SMSF portfolios\n\nWhen looking at SMSF portfolios in Sharesight,
  possibly unsurprisingly, investors primarily hold high-yield finance shares with
  a history of paying dividends that include franking credits. The remainder is a
  mix of Australian growth stocks (such as Afterpay (ASX: APT) & Appen (ASX: APX))
  and ETFs to gain broad exposure and help meet portfolio diversification goals.\n\n![Top
  SMSF shares 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3gGpN0J4OaWqvYmTf5KJSi/2b669029b312fe083b824be6f8d6a678/Top_SMSF_shares_2020.png?w=950)\n\nMost
  interesting this year was the appearance of the BetaShares Australian Strong Bear
  ETF (ASX: BBOZ) in SMSF portfolios, an ETF that aims to provide a [negative magnified
  return of 2-2.75x the movement in the ASX 200](https://www.betashares.com.au/fund/australian-equities-strong-bear-fund/)
  accumulation index. This ETF is believed to be part of a defensive strategy by some
  SMSF trustees to hedge against COVID-related market risks to their portfolios in
  2020.\n\n## How did these investments perform in FY19/20? \n\nTo get an understanding
  of how a basket of these 20 shares would have performed for SMSF trustees during
  the last financial year, we created a portfolio in Sharesight with an equal weighting
  for the 20 shares. We \"purchased\" a single parcel of each share (worth $10,000)
  on 1 Jul 2019 and used [Sharesight’s Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/performance_report/)
  to calculate the annualised return including dividends (total annualised return)
  through to 30 June 2020.\n\n## Total return in FY19/20\n\nWhen we run [Sharesight’s
  Performance Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  on this portfolio we see the impact of 2020’s COVID market volatility first hand,
  particularly through the large falls in capital value in the finance sector. However
  for SMSF investors primarily holding these shares for dividend income, these falls
  may not be an immediate concern.\n\nThese falls in capital value across the SMSF
  Top 20 portfolio wiped nearly 10% off its value, however this was offset by dividend
  income yielding 3.22%, delivering a total return for the portfolio of -6.36% during
  the financial year.\n\n![Performance of SMSF shares 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3Gi6yJSrHrdIdvmzPC6Yu5/6364f01c85e780d787defe6a3a6449ed/Performance_of_SMSF_shares_2020.png?w=950)\n\nAmong
  the top performers were Zip Co Limited (ASX: Z1P), returning nearly 69% and CSL
  Limited (ASX: CSL), returning over 33% over the period. At the other end of the
  spectrum, online travel firm Webjet Limited (ASX: WEB) was hammered by the impacts
  of COVID on the outlook for travel, down 73% during the financial year.\n\n### Dividend
  returns\n\nIf we run the same performance report and sort holdings by dividend return,
  we can examine the drivers of income for SMSF portfolios.\n\n![SMSF dividend shares
  2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/558WMRRKA0Jdnl4P5zh0QW/d2790815b29a0e96573861e672d5df34/SMSF_dividend_shares_2020.png?w=950)\n\nSMSF
  trustees that invest for dividend income saw dividend yield above 5% from 6 of the
  20 shares in the portfolio in FY19/20, led by Commonwealth Bank (ASX: CBA) and BHP
  Group (ASX: BHP).\n\n### Franking credits highly desired by SMSF investors\n\n[Sharesight’s
  Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/) allows us to
  look at all the dividends paid during the year by shares in the portfolio, as well
  as highlight the strong preference of SMSF investors for Australian shares that
  pay fully franked dividends.\n\n![Franking Credits SMSFs 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4iVAl9fm04S7XnhmdxRCza/811af9e2be7ea718df31e20c1c9eac18/Franking_Credits_SMSFs_2020.png?w=950)\n\nOf
  the shares in the SMSF Top 20 that paid dividends during the financial year, all
  except CSL (ASX: CSL) and Vanguard’s international shares ETF, (ASX: VGS) were either
  partially or fully franked, highlighting the importance of franking credits as a
  consideration of trustees seeking the best returns from their SMSF within Australia’s
  tax regime.\n\n## SMSF Top 20 portfolio diversity\n\nBy looking at the portfolio
  diversification, and grouping shares in the portfolio by industry classification,
  we see that finance and banking shares make up a significant percentage of the portfolio
  which could present [concentration risks](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/articles/insights/research-commentary/portfolio-construction/over-concentration-risk.jsp)
  if this was a real SMSF portfolio.\n\n![SMSF portfolio diversity](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5kxURuB5qRGlnlWXDfNpgG/4981f70085d6bac5ad61f286c621d67f/SMSF_portfolio_diversity.png?w=950)\n\n##
