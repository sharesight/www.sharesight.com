  This month the product team continued to enhance and rollout our new trade importer UI which makes it much easier to import trading data into Sharesight regardless of source. We are also taking an ‘API first’ approach to redesigning several core parts of our UI and plan to make these new API endpoints publicly available in our new V3 API in due course.
