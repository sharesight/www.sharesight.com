:content: "If you’re a dividend income or dividend growth investor, tracking the value
  of dividends from your investments over time is essential, particularly if you rely
  on dividend income to fund your lifestyle. While there are a number of ways to track
  dividend performance in Sharesight, one of our users shared a trick he uses to track
  his dividend income on a monthly basis to help manage cash flow. \n\nWe love it
  when investors find creative ways to use Sharesight, and we found this method so
  useful that we thought it was worth sharing with you.\n\n![How to track monthly
  dividend income from your investments](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4s1SfjWNkoff1mtvIdNjnB/622043f85a482f9c43b9def19f1d5225/How_to_track_monthly_dividend__income_from_your_investments.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Get all your investments into Sharesight\n\nThe first step for any dividend investor
  is to [get all their investments into Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/au/adding-your-investments-into-sharesight/),
  including any [investment property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and fixed income securities.\n\n![Dividend income portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4qAdObUvya8OyUtGZrsNIr/679c22678639ebf9f37b8e459d75ac74/Dividend_income_portfolio.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Use the Future Income Report to see income on a monthly basis\n\nIn this particularly
  unique method, our user shared how he uses the [Future Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/)
  to look at historical dividends.\n\nThis differs somewhat from the typical use of
  the Future Income Report, which is to [view upcoming declared dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/).
  Because of this, the default time period for this report is set to the following
  12 months.\n\n![View upcoming dividends](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4qnHUTjCUT52X4oOUJaPup/4570f64b32f801181c04bfd150d92742/View_upcoming_dividends.png?w=950)\n\nHowever,
  using the date filter you can set the date range for the report to *any* time period,
  including the past. To view a monthly snapshot, just set the date range as the start
  and end of the month in question.\n\n![Company dividends by month](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5bV6fjnzGT7GEytnrp9oEd/fcb3d50061de3b0a269805c31c758f13/Company_dividends_by_month.png?w=950)\n\nWith
  the date filter set, the report will show every dividend and distribution paid by
  investments in your portfolio. The report also includes the date each dividend was
  paid, the [ex-dividend date](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/ex-dividend-dates-and-their-impact-on-stock-prices-explained/),
  the total value of the dividend, plus the value of any tax or [franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/dividend-franking-and-performance/)
  (as applicable to some ASX-listed stocks).\n\n![Historic dividend payments](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3PASdO4B3hJjkyUUT7GBPT/b002d2384eaa2a2586fb4a7c99e06d57/Historic_dividend_payments.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  view a summary of *just* the total dividend income received each month, you can
  change the Future Income Report view using the \"advanced options\" menu to instead
  just show monthly totals over your set time frame.\n\n![Monthly dividend income
  totals](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3UxGBTwFlKhrLurkByCO2H/9c49e5ebd0d1cd0e20d47708347e71de/Monthly_dividend_income_totals.png?w=950)\n\nAfter
  selecting the ‘show monthly totals’ filter, your dividend income is calculated by
  month over the date range.\n\n![Dividend income paid per month](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6hGPsrtIK2cHPLdfv71Fnu/b30bdb582ddad7156cfb4f6925ea11e9/Dividend_income_paid_per_month.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Export it to a spreadsheet to build your monthly dividend income statement\n\nAny
  report in Sharesight can be [exported to a spreadsheet in Excel or Google or to
  a PDF](https://help.sharesight.com/exporting-a-report/). Using a Google spreadsheet,
  you could look to build a monthly income graph to see if your dividend income fluctuates
  in predictable ways at certain times each year -- allowing you to better smooth
  out this cash flow variability over the long term.\n\n## Sharesight – built for
  dividend investors\n\n[Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/) was built for the
  needs of dividend investors just like you to make tracking dividend income portfolios
  easy. With Sharesight you can:\n\n* Automatically [track your dividend and distribution
  income](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/) from stocks, ETFs, LICs and
