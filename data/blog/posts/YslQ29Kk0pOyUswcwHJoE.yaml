:content: "Warren Buffett is definitely a believer in self-education. He reads for
  five or six hours per day, which allows him to keep on top of business and finance
  news, discover new ideas and hone his critical thinking skills. \n\nWhile reading
  is wonderful, there’s an even more efficient way to consume knowledge – podcasting.
  Unless you’re a speed-reader, you listen faster than you read, which is why podcasts
  allow you to learn faster than books. They’re also more flexible, because you can
  listen to podcasts everywhere you can read books – as well as when you’re exercising
  at the gym, commuting to work or doing household chores.\n\nSo here are 10 podcasts
  for investors to subscribe to, no matter where in the world you are.\n\n![top podcasts
