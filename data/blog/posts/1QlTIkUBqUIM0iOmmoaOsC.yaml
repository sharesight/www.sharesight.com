:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only
  and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice
  and should not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nFor Canadians
  filing their taxes for the 2020 tax year we've put together the below with important
  tax dates, as well as some helpful [Sharesight](/) features that can save Canadian
  investors both time and money this tax season.\n\n## Canadian tax features within
  Sharesight\n\n1. [Canadian tax settings](#canadian-tax-settings)\n2. [Canadian Capital
  Gains Tax Report](#canadian-capital-gains-tax-report)\n3. [Taxable Income Report](#taxable-income-report)\n\n![Sharesight

  Important Canadian tax filing deadlines\n\n**MARCH 1, 2021 -- RRSP contribution
  deadline**<br>\nThe final date for your RRSP contributions to be eligible for the
  2020 tax year.\n\n**APRIL 30, 2021 -- Income tax filing AND payment deadline**<br>\nLast
  day for individuals to file *and* pay their income taxes for the 2020 financial
  year.\n\n**JUNE 15, 2021-- Tax deadline (self-employed)**<br>\nThe deadline to file
  your 2020 taxes if you're self-employed\n\n## Canadian tax features within Sharesight\nWith
  all your dividends automatically captured and in one place, Sharesight makes tax-time
  a breeze. You can save yourself potentially thousands of dollars in accounting fees
  (including hundreds spent on CGT reports alone) by running your own tax reports
  and sharing them with your accountant. Here's how:\n\n### 1 -- Canadian tax settings\nInvestors
  with a Sharesight portfolio tax residency set to “Canada” have a choice of the following
  tax settings which conform to [Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax.html)
  (CRA) tax reporting rules:\n\n| Tax Entity Type     | Notes     |\n| ----------
  | ---------- |\n| Non-registered | Standard tax rules apply.|\n| Registered Retirement
  Savings Plan (RRSP)| Non-resident withholding tax does not apply for US stocks.|\n|
  Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) | Non-resident withholding tax does not
  apply for US stocks.|\n| Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) | Income from Canadian
  investments will be treated as non-taxable by default and not appear on the Taxable
  Income Report. Non-resident withholding tax still applies.|\n\n### 2 -- Canadian
  Capital Gains Tax Report\nThe [Canadian Capital Gains Tax Report](/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/)
  available on our Investor and Expert plans, calculates capital gains made on shares
  using the 'Adjusted Cost Base' sale allocation method as per CRA rules. It breaks
  down short and long term capital gains and capital losses, and allows you to customise
  your discount rate and sale allocation method. It even lets you “carry forward”
  losses from the previous reporting period:\n\n![cgt report - canada 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2HgKKQ40OfmVHHs72AX6FV/5b011e5543183879229ca990cc3ff084/sharesight-cgt-report-canada-2019.png?w=950)\n\n>
  For $25 per month I was given back about 15 hours\nof my life usually devoted to
  manually calculating CGT.<br>\n<cite>STEPHEN COLMAN, SHARESIGHT CLIENT</cite>\n\n###
  3 -- Taxable Income Report\nThe [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/)
  takes it a step further by breaking down all dividends over any time period, organised
  by local/overseas income, as well as non-trust/trust income (such as ETFs).\n\n![taxable
  income report - canada 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/514HuvARbvD0zStTsOQ7fG/4890c70d522d30622e183aa38d5f6080/sharesight-taxable-income-report-canada-2019.png?w=950)\n\n###
  BONUS -- Portfolio sharing\nAnother essential tax-time feature is the ability to
  [share your portfolio](/blog/sharesight-portfolio-sharing-now-on-all-plans-even-free/).
  Rather than printing-out and forwarding your Sharesight tax reports, you can securely
  share portfolio access directly with your accountant and/or financial advisor. With
  all your portfolio data in one place, they’ll have everything they need to prepare
  your tax documents. Available on all Sharesight plans, portfolio sharing ensures
  everyone’s on the same page and focusing on what really matters -- not just at tax-time
  but throughout the year.\n\n## Simply the best portfolio tracker for Canadian investors\n\nOver
