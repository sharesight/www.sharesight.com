:title: Sharesight teams up with CMC Markets Stockbroking
:url_slug: sharesight-teams-up-with-cmc-markets-stockbroking
:content: |-
  We are excited to announce that we have partnered with [CMC Markets Stockbroking](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/) to integrate our two services. This allows CMC Markets Stockbroking customers to link their CMC online broking account to a [Sharesight](/) portfolio and have all past and future share trading transactions automatically recorded into Sharesight.

  ![featured - CMC + Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2N93kMKHi3V8JwwPAfcEOI/5c653cf29d1b0cd6f169f353ec37e884/featured_cmc-sharesight.png?w=950)

  CMC Markets Stockbroking clients will be spared the task of having to manually enter all their historic trades when setting up their Sharesight portfolio and any future share trades will be automatically synchronised to Sharesight. Best of all, customers with small portfolios will be able to take advantage of Sharesightâ€™s new free plan to manage their portfolio in Sharesight at no cost. Our standard [Investor and Expert plans](/pricing/) will also be available to customers who require the additional functionality.

  The CMC partnership is another significant step towards our ultimate goal which is to make life easier for investors by fully automating the administration and management of investment portfolios.

  We are working hard to ensure similar functionality is available to all share market investors. We are in discussions with a number of other brokers about providing similar functionality and our ultimate goal is to provide seamless connections to all brokers in Australia and NZ. **Feel free to let your favourite broker know that you would like them to implement this service as well!**

  ## How do I connect my account to CMC?
  <del>If you are a CMC client this functionality will be rolled out over the next month. CMC will host a dedicated page on their site which will provide customers with the opportunity to create a new Sharesight account or link an existing account. Transactions will then be automatically recorded in Sharesight as soon as a trade is completed in the CMC system.</del>

  If you're already a CMC client, simply login to your [CMC Markets Stockbroking](https://oaf.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/onboarding-start?product=stb) account and navigate to  **Account > Tax & Portfolio Reporting**. From there, you'll be able to create a new Sharesight account or link an existing account. Transactions will be automatically recorded in Sharesight as soon as a trade is completed in the CMC system.<sup>1</sup>
