:title: 3 reasons why Australian investors need to be tracking dividends
:url_slug: 3-reasons-why-australian-investors-need-to-be-tracking-dividends
:content: "Income received from share dividends is a critical part of household income
  for many Australians, particularly [self-funded retirees](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/).
  In this age where the RBA cash rate has hit record lows with few signs of moving
  higher in the near future, investing in listed companies that pay dividends is one
  of the best places to achieve higher investment yield.\n\n[Dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  might seem ‘unsexy’ compared to tracking capital growth, but dividends have a material
  impact on your investment returns, particularly when they include franking credits,
  so it’s critical to ensure you’ve got the complete picture.\n\nOnly tracking the
  cash you receive from dividends doesn’t go far enough. To get the full picture of
  the impact of dividends on your investment performance, you need to understand:\n\n-
  [How much cash you receive from dividends](#tracking-cash-income-from-dividends)\n\n-
  [The dividend tax implications](#dividend-tax-implications)\n\n- [The impact of
  dividend reinvestment](#the-impact-of-dividend-reinvestment)\n\n![Australian dividend

  Tracking cash income from dividends\n\nUnderstanding which investments cash dividends
  come from and how they impact your investment return is an admin nightmare. Listed
  companies, [exchange traded funds (ETFs)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/),
  and managed funds outsource the responsibility of tracking who owns shares, and
  who is paid dividends to share registries.\n\nIn Australia there are six different
  share registries. The most common ones investors will encounter are [Computershare](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/computershare/)
  and Link Market Services. This means that to get an accurate record of dividends
  received across an investment portfolio, investors will often need to pull together
  dividend data from the web sites of multiple registries, or pour over mailed dividend
  statements for each holding.\n\nFor one of the holdings in my portfolio, Telstra
  (ASX:TLS), the registry electronically deposits cash dividends to my bank account.
  This is great (some companies send paper cheques instead), but even though the dividend
  is deposited to an account with the same institution that I use for brokerage, the
  broker has no visibility on the source of this cash, so they can’t calculate the
  dividend yield from it.\n\nUsing a dedicated investment portfolio tracker like [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/)
  can help remove this admin nightmare. Sharesight sources dividend information directly
  from over 30 stock exchanges around the world, automatically calculating your dividend
  yield for each holding regardless of whether the dividend is paid electronically,
  or via cheque.\n\n![Telstra dividend performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/474YWgD8Q9gEb2tpRGjQrG/5298dfb52859257670d4a3554c94d9b9/Telstra_dividend_performance.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  Telstra’s case, over the past year, I can see that dividends accounted for over
  6.25% of my total return. Not only that, but by looking back over the entire period
  I’ve held Telstra shares I can see every dividend received since I first bought
  TLS.\n\n## Dividend tax implications\n\nDepending on the investment type and your
  home country, dividend income is typically taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.
  In Australia however, there is added complexity from dividend [franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/)
  as well as the [attribution managed investment trust tax components](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/australian-etf-distribution-components-now-available-for-fy1920/)
  used by ETFs and managed funds.\n\nLooking at the bank account the registry deposits
  dividends to won’t help, because you’ll only see the net amount paid. Going to the
  registry for the information needed to calculate dividend tax implications is a
  good start, but the registries fall short in two ways. One, you will likely still
  need to rely on multiple registries to compile a portfolio-wide tax picture. Two,
  they will sometimes only provide you with the most recent financial year’s data
  for free, charging you a fee if you need access to information from previous years.\n\nFortunately,
  Sharesight receives the same dividend and franking credit information the registries
  do (minus the official statements). This means that any franking credits are automatically
  recorded and can be used to easily calculate your taxable income on these investments.\n\n![Tracking

  it a step further, this also means that it’s quite easy to calculate the impact
  of dividends on your taxes across your investment portfolio, as these figures are
  wrapped up into a single [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/)
  which breaks out non-trust from trust income, and domestic from foreign income.\n\n##
  The impact of dividend reinvestment\n\nAssuming you don’t immediately need the cash
  income from dividends, some Australian companies allow you to automatically reinvest
  dividends in the company via their registry. This allows you to stay as fully invested
  as possible, without incurring additional transaction costs. Unfortunately, [dividend
  reinvestment plans (DRPs)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  further complicate managing your investment portfolio for the following reasons.\n\nFirst,
  because the DRP is managed by the share registry and not your broker, the broker
  will have no visibility into dividends that are reinvested. Second, when a dividend
  is reinvested, shares are ‘bought’ for you at a specific price. This means that
  the cost base and the amount invested is constantly changing and will have tax implications
  when disposing of the shares. It also makes it difficult to calculate your true
  performance, with any return calculations reliant on the cost base.\n\n![Dividend

  use dividend reinvestment plans personally for any ETFs I own when they are available,
  with Sharesight able to automatically calculate the impact of dividend reinvestments
  on my cost base and performance figures.\n\n### How to track dividend reinvestment
