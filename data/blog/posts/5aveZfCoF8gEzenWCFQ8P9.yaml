  can automatically import trades directly into their Sharesight portfolio, giving

  Who is Ally Invest?\n\n[Ally Invest](https://www.ally.com/invest/) is a US broker
  with an online trading platform that provides self-directed trading and managed
  portfolio services. The broker offers trading fees from $0 for US stocks and ETFs,
  as well as portfolio management with no advisory fees. Ally Invest gives US investors
  access to US stocks, ETFs, options, mutual/managed funds and fixed income investments,
  as well as forex trading through affiliate company [Ally Invest Forex](https://www.ally.com/invest/forex/).
  Other features include stock screeners, third-party research and charting capabilities,
  as well as a range of investor education offerings. Sharesight supports Ally Invest
  in addition to other US brokers that use [Apex Clearing Corporation](https://www.apexclearing.com/)
  to process trades, such as M1 Finance. \n\n## Import your Ally Invest data to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to import your historical and ongoing trades in US stocks and ETFs through
  the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) feature,
  or you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading a [spreadsheet
  file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet\n\nOne
  simple way to import historical trades to Sharesight is by creating and formatting
  a [ spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1) filled
  with trades from your trading account.\n\n ![image 1 Ally](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5o1M8Irarg8lrvCvQPjw78/b7b37350bc2bb245863effcad7a95c5a/image_1_Ally.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio.\n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** This feature is designed primarily for ongoing
  trades, but it can also be used to fill in historical trades in your Sharesight
  portfolio. All you need to do is manually forward the Trade Confirmation Emails
  for the trades you wish to see in your portfolio, starting with the earliest trade
  you want included.\n\n## Get started with Sharesight\n\nJoin thousands of investors
