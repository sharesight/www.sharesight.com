:content: "Did you know that Sharesight allows investors to track more than just stocks?
  In addition to support for mutual/managed funds in Australia, New Zealand and Canada,
  Sharesight tracks the price and distribution information for over **12,000 mutual
  funds in the United Kingdom**, one of more than [40 global stock exchanges and mutual
  funds](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)
  that we support.\n\nSharesight has fund data from [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/)
  dating back as far as 1 January 2000, with prices updated daily by end-of-day, UK
  time – making it easy for UK investors to track the performance of multi-asset investment
  portfolios in a single place.\n\n![Sharesight UKmutualfunds 0](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4odwBMqExvKzNgRu89zSMY/3a00e163bb6ca751eb33f1c6671bb6dd/Sharesight_UKmutualfunds_0.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a mutual fund?\n\nMutual funds give investors access to a diversified collection
  of stocks and/or bonds across a range of sectors and markets in a single fund. Mutual
  funds offer scale, diversity, reduced risk and less exposure to market volatility
  than investing in a single company or industry would, making them appealing to investors
  looking for a convenient and professionally managed product.\n\nThe main advantages
  of mutual funds include:\n\n* **Managed by professionals:** Funds are managed by
  experts who regularly monitor the fund’s performance\n\n* **Diversification:** Investors
  can spread their money across a wide range of investments, with tailored products
  that correspond to different investing strategies, assets and risk tolerances\n\n*
  **Affordability:** Investing in a managed fund is more cost-effective than investing
  in a basket of individual stocks\n\nMutual funds have historically been a popular
  choice in the United Kingdom, with these investors [preferring funds](https://www.theia.org/sites/default/files/2019-09/IMS%20Chapter%205.pdf)
  that prioritise outcome and allocation, as well as Targeted Absolute Return. \n\n##
  UK mutual fund support in Sharesight\n\nSharesight supports all UK mutual funds
  covered by Morningstar price data — over 12,000 — which will continue to grow as
  additional mutual funds enter the market and are included in the Sharesight database.\n\nAs
  users add UK mutual fund investments to their portfolios (details below), they can
  get the full picture of their investment performance by viewing their fund investments
  with the rest of their holdings, whether they be stocks, ETFs or even custom investments
  such as property or term deposits. This makes it easy for investors to see the impact
  of specific investments as part of the overall return of their portfolio. \n\n![Sharesight

  How to track UK mutual funds in Sharesight\n\n1. Sign-up for a FREE [Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  account.\n\n2. [Add your holdings](https://help.sharesight.com/au/getting-started-with-sharesight/)
  to your portfolio(s) by searching for the fund’s name or ISIN identifier in the
  FundUK market. You can also use the [Sharesight File Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  to bulk import trades to your portfolio. \n\n3. Sharesight converts the prices and
  valuations of your holdings from their listed market to your portfolio’s base currency.
  It also automatically calculates any currency fluctuations on a daily basis and
  backfills past distributions (and continues to add new ones as they are announced).\n\n![UK

  Knowing your fund’s unique ISIN identifier will make it easier to import your trades
  to Sharesight. </small>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is an ISIN?</summary>\n<br>\n<h2>What
  is an ISIN?</h2>\n<p>An International Securities Identification Number (or ISIN)
  is a unique 12-digit code that identifies a specific security. Unlike ticker symbols,
  which are specific to stock exchanges, the ISIN is universally recognisable. This
  makes it easy to identify the specific fund you are looking for in Sharesight. </p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Already
