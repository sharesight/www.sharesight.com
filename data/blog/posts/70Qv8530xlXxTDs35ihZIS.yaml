:title: What is the Foreign Investment Funds (FIF) Tax in New Zealand?
:url_slug: what-is-the-foreign-investment-funds-tax-on-shares-in-new-zealand
:content: "###### Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and
  does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and
  should not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser or
  accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nThe [foreign investment
  fund (FIF)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/)
  taxation regime in New Zealand is broadly designed to prevent taxpayers from using
  investments in offshore entities to avoid or defer their tax obligations. These
  rules apply to offshore investments held by New Zealand-resident taxpayers and target
  overseas companies who do not pay dividends.\n\nThe tax implications of the FIF
  regime mean it’s necessary to understand which investments are considered foreign
  investment funds under the rules, how to calculate FIF income and how it impacts
  portfolio returns.\n\n## Why does NZ have a FIF regime?\n\nIn order to diversify
  their portfolios beyond the opportunities available domestically, many New Zealanders
  invest in overseas companies or unit trusts.The FIF rules impose a tax on the underlying
  income that is derived from such investments, both to ensure a fair playing field
  and to encourage investment in NZ-domiciled companies.  \n\nTo illustrate how common
  it is for New Zealand-based investors to invest internationally, 52% of all Sharesight
  users in NZ own direct holdings in markets outside New Zealand. This increases to
  almost 90% of New Zealand-based investors on Sharesight paid plans. \n\n## What
  is a FIF?\n\nNew Zealand Inland Revenue Department (IRD) [defines a FIF](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/Project/IR/PDF/ir461.pdf)
  as:\n\n- a foreign company\n- a foreign unit trust\n- a [foreign superannuation
  scheme](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2014-faqs-foreign-super/frequently-asked-questions)
  (prior to 1 April 2014)\n- a FIF superannuation interest (from 1 April 2014)\n-
  an insurer under a life insurance policy (and the policy is not offered or entered
  into in New Zealand).\n\nWhile the FIF rules serve as an incentive to invest locally,
  they largely exempt small foreign investments of [less than NZ$50,000](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/Project/IR/PDF/ir461.pdf).These
  were first introduced as part of a [tax reform package on 1 April 2007](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2010-dd-international-tax-review-non-portfolio-fifs/overview)
  to remove inconsistencies in the old rules. The rules were [amended in 2014](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/topical-issues/proposed-changes-foreign-superannuation-tax-rules).\n\nThere
  are also different rules for holdings of [10% or more that may apply](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/).
  A FIF [does not include](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/Project/IR/PDF/ir461.pdf)
  term deposits, bonds, debentures, money lent, foreign employment, pensions, qualifying
  foreign private annuity or rental investments.\n\n## How is FIF income calculated?\n\nThe
  rules for FIF were at least in part defined by [New Zealand legislation before ](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2010-dd-international-tax-review-non-portfolio-fifs/overview)[2007](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2010-dd-international-tax-review-non-portfolio-fifs/overview)
  but reform aimed to simplify the process by introducing the Fair Dividend Rate Method
  (FDR) and Cost Method (CM). This means that since July 2011, investors need to consider
  the following [five calculation methods](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/documents/forms-and-guides/ir400---ir499/ir461/ir461-2019.pdf)
  depending on their type of foreign investment and information they have available.
  These are:\n\n• fair dividend rate (FDR)\n\n• comparative value (CV)\n\n• cost method
  (CM)\n\n• deemed rate of return (DRR)\n\n• attributable FIF income method.\n\nRetail
  investors tend to choose [the FDR method](https://help.sharesight.com/au/fdr_income_fif_reports_page/)
  as this ensures a flat tax is paid of 5% on the share portfolio’s opening market
  value each year. The excess return is effectively tax free and generally only shares
  held at the start of an income year are taken into account, with purchases and sales
  of shares during the year excluded. However, shares that are purchased and sold
  in the same income year are taxed on the lower of 5% of their cost or the actual
  gains made on these \"quick sales\" - the term for a sale of shares in a company
  are bought and sold within the same income year.\n\nInvestors can also use the [Comparative
  Value (CV) method](https://help.sharesight.com/cv_method_fif_reports_page/) which
  determines taxable FIF income from the change in value of the investment each tax
  year, with an adjustment for capital gains and dividends In some cases it is possible
  to [switch between FDR and CV](https://www.markhams.co.nz/news/september-2018/foreign-shares-and-fif)
  each year to achieve the best tax outcome.\n\nThe [claiming of FIF losses](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/Project/IR/PDF/ir461.pdf)
  has its own set of complexities and is best discussed with a tax agent or financial
  adviser.\n\n## Exemptions to FIF rules in NZ\n\nA full list of exemptions to the
  FIF rules is contained in the [New Zealand Income Tax Act 2007](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0097/latest/DLM1512301.html)
  and these are best discussed with your tax agent or financial adviser as general
  tax rules will still apply. However, the key exemptions for New Zealand residents
  to be aware of are:\n\n* the total amount of investment of a natural person or eligible
  trust doesn't exceed the NZ$50,000 threshold at any time in the year. This cut off
  is intended to reduce compliance costs for investors with relatively small amounts
  invested offshore.\n\n* Australian listed shares are generally exempt from the FIF
  rules and are taxed in the same way as NZ investments. This means dividends are
  taxable when received and capital gains are tax free. However, the investment must
  [listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/foreign-investment-funds-fifs/foreign-investment-fund-rules-exemptions).
  To help investors decide whether or not an Australian company satisfies the exemption
  criteria, New Zealand Inland Revenue have listed companies that qualify for the
  exemption from the FIF rules on its website.\n\n* Where an investor’s interests
  are 10% or more of the direct income interest, the FIF rules are suspended. For
  example, if a New Zealand resident owns more than 10% of the shares in a foreign
  company then, to encourage foreign ownership, the tax does not apply.\n\n* Land
  investment outside of New Zealand does not fall under FIF as the rules deal mainly
  with shares. But, like any of the above investments which are exempt from FIF, these
  may fall under other existing tax rules, where investors are generally taxed on
  dividends rather than capital gains.\n\nFor more detail on these points, [click
  here](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/Project/IR/PDF/ir461.pdf).\n\n## FIF superannuation
  interests rules\n\n[From 1 April 2014](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2014-faqs-foreign-super/frequently-asked-questions),
  unless they are a \"FIF superannuation interest\" investments in foreign superannuation
  schemes were no longer taxed under the FIF rules. In this context, a FIF superannuation
  interest is defined as:\n\n·       an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme
  acquired while the investor was a resident in New Zealand, or treated as a New Zealand
  tax resident under a [double tax agreement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double_taxation.asp),
  or\n\n·       an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme where the investor
  complied with the FIF rules for an income year ending before 1 April 2014, returned
  that income in their income tax returns filed before 20 May 2013 and continue to
  return the income on that interest in succeeding years.\n\nInvestments in foreign
  superannuation schemes that is not considered a \"FIF superannuation interest\"
  are [taxed under different rules](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/foreign-investment-funds-fifs).\n\n##
  FIF tax issues to avoid\n\nThere are various exemptions from the FIF rules and [common
  pitfalls](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/documents/forms-and-guides/ir400---ir499/ir461/ir461-2019.pdf)
  that can be avoided:\n\n·       Transitional residents should ensure they are not
  taxed on their foreign investment income during their transitional period. This
  temporary tax exemption on foreign investment income expires after 48 months. All
  other residents are required to return dividends as received from foreign investments
  that are exempt from the FIF regime, such as Australian shares. Dividends received
  from investments that are subject to the foreign investment fund regime must not
  be returned when received as the income is calculated under the FIF rules.\n\n·
  \      From 1 April 2014, lump sum withdrawals or transfers from foreign superannuation
  funds are generally excluded from the FIF rules and will be taxed at time of withdrawal
  or transfer.\n\n·       Generally pension payments are taxable in New Zealand. However,
  some offshore social security pensions are not required to be returned in New Zealand.\n\n·
  \      Some investors are able to calculate their FIF income under the FDR or CV
  method and they can return annually the lesser of the two. Any losses must be reduced
  to nil. However, these losses must not be included as part of overseas income.\n\n·
  \      For some investments, New Zealanders are not allowed to use the FDR method.
  These investments are usually called FDR prohibited or CV enforced investments.
  In such cases income is calculated under the comparative value method for as long
  as the person owns the investments.\n\n## NZ investors can calculate FIF income
