:title: What are custodial vs. non-custodial investments?
:url_slug: what-are-custodial-vs-non-custodial-investments
:content: "If you’ve ever heard the term \"custodian\" used in association with investing,
  you may be wondering what exactly this means. In this blog, we take a deep dive
  into the purpose of a custodian and the difference between custodial and non-custodial
  investments, as well as some of the potential risks associated with holding investments
  through a custodian. Keep reading to learn more. \n\n![What are custodial vs. non-custodial
  investments](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3xDlai1c0o1bBlZRZpkgEa/137fa43c28eeed94644b4159138a80fe/custodial_investments_feature_image_2.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a custodian?\n\nA custodian is an organisation or company that holds securities
  or investments on behalf of investors for safekeeping purposes. The concept of a
  custodian is to act as an intermediary and to prevent securities or investments
  from being stolen or lost. Custodians may hold assets in physical or electronic
  form.\n\nAn example of custodial investment assets would be holding a direct share
  like Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) through an investment platform, not
  a stockbroker. \n\nIn these instances, the investment platform may use a custodian
  to hold the investment on behalf of the investor. As part of this arrangement, it’s
  important to note the investor is not the legal owner of the investments. The investment
  platform will then recuperate the cost from their clients in the form of administration
  or custodian fees.\n\n## What is an investment platform? \n\nAn investment platform
  is similar to a broker in which it allows you to transact online to buy, hold and
  sell securities and managed funds. Platforms can also offer a more diverse range
  of options including wholesale managed investments, private equity, and term deposits.
  However, in the case of an investment platform, they in ‘most’ cases use a custodian
  to hold investments on behalf of clients and may charge administrative fees or custodial
  fees. There is also an administrative element as part of the platform's service
  offering. \n\nThe increasingly popular investment platforms in Australia include
  Hub24, Praemium, BT Panorama, NetWealth, Macquarie WRAP. They are often referred
  to as ‘administrators’ as they charge an administration fee, not a technology or
  service fee. \n\nThe aforementioned investment platforms all have similar arrangements
  where they may use a custodian to hold investments on behalf of their clients. As
  such, there are associated fees for this service. To find out if your investment
  platform is using a custodian, refer to the most recent Product Disclosure Statement
  (PDS) or their contact for customer support. \n\n## What are non-custodial investments?\n\nNon-custodial
  investments are where an investor or adviser on their behalf trades or has assets
  in the name of the investor. Often this occurs directly through a stockbroker like
  SelfWealth, Bell Potter, or Commsec, for example. \n\nUnder this arrangement using
  Australia as an example, the investor would have a holder identification number
  (HIN) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) which is known as [CHESS](https://www.commsec.com.au/support/help-centre/About-the-sharemarket/What-is-CHESS.html#:~:text=What%20is%20CHESS%3F%20CHESS%20stands%20for%20Clearing%20House,shareholdings%20and%20manage%20the%20settlement%20of%20share%20transactions.).
  When an investor or adviser executes trades on their behalf, the investor is registered
  on the ASX’s registry CHESS as the legal and beneficial owner.\n\nIn this instance,
  the investor will receive mail, notification of corporate actions, and statements
  including dividends or distributions. These types of communications aren’t received
  by the investor if there is a custodian holding the investments, however. In this
  case, the custodian would receive these updates and the investment platform would
  be responsible for informing the investor. \n\nWith non-custodial investments, the
  investments are held in an investor’s name with them as the beneficial owner. This
  means there’s not an associated third party risk or any administration or custodial
  fees applicable. The investor or adviser on their behalf can purchase more units
  or sell units on an exchange at the market price. \n\n*Note: For US holdings via
  an Australian broker there are instances where these are held via a custodian.*\n\n##
  What are the risks of using a custodian?  \n\n[Stockspot](https://www.stockspot.com.au/)
  founder and CEO [Chris Brycki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brycki/) shares his views
  about the risks of using a custodian in an interview with the ABC. \n\nAccording
  to the [article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-05/share-custodians-holding-your-stocks-explainer/13177716),
  Brycki’s firm has avoided using custodians for its investors.\n\n\"When that company
  goes belly up, you become a secured creditor and you actually have to chase your
  investments,\" he explains.\n\n\"So you're not only wearing the risk of the share
  market, you're risking your money with a counter-party that you're not sure how
  creditworthy they are.\"\n\nThis isn't just a hypothetical risk. Several major stockbroking
  and funds management firms have collapsed in Australia over recent years, with their
  clients often waiting years to access their investments, or what's left of them.\n\n\"You
  may not end up getting all of your money back,\" Brycki warns.\n\n\"So, in some
  recent cases, it may be somewhere like 80 to 90 cents in the dollar — you may be
  lucky and get more, but you could also be unlucky and get a lot less.\"\n\nAccording
  to Brycki, that means it's important to know who you're dealing with before you
  hand over your money.\n\n\"If you are investing with a nominee company or a custodian,
  what's important to uncover is who the custodian really is and is it a trustworthy
  business.\"\n\nRead the full article by the ABC [here](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-05/share-custodians-holding-your-stocks-explainer/13177716).\n\n##
