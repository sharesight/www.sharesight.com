  ## 2. [Capital gains tax calculator for Australian investors](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)

  Calculating capital gains on share trading in Australia can be quite complicated, with the choice of a number of different sale allocation methods, as well as different CGT discounts depending on the length of time the shares were held. Fortunately [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/) includes a powerful Australian Capital Gains Tax Report that helps investors easily calculate their CGT obligations.

  ## 3. [How to calculate franking credits on your investment portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/)

  When introduced in Australia 1987, the original intent of the dividend imputation regime was to stop the double taxation of company dividends. Australia was the first country in the world to introduce this double taxation avoidance regime. As part of this regime, the concept of ‘franking credits’ was introduced. In this post we dive into what franking credits are, and how to calculate them with Sharesight.

  ##  5. [How to track a dividend reinvestment plan](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)

  Also known as DRPs or DRIPs, dividend reinvestment plans (or distribution reinvestment plans if referring to funds or trusts such as ETFs and REITs) allow you to automatically reinvest your dividends in new shares rather than receiving cash. Because DRPs are an automatic purchase or ‘buy’ trade, they can affect the cost base for your shares and complicate capital gains tax calculations when the time comes to sell. With Sharesight [tracking DRPs is easy for NZX and ASX shares](https://help.sharesight.com/drp/), and we even detail how to track DRPs on other markets in this article as well.

In this article we share three tips to maximise the size of your investment portfolio in time for retirement.

  ## 7. [Calculating taxable gains on share trading in New Zealand](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculating-taxable-gains-on-share-trading-in-new-zealand/)
