:title: The time is now for financial planners to embrace fintechs
:content: "###### NOTE: A version of this article first appeared at [Adviser Innovation](http://www.adviserinnovation.com.au/2017/12/08/time-now-financial-advisers-embrace-fintechs/).\n\nRecently
  the Financial Planning Association of Australia (FPA) released a [white paper](https://fpa.com.au/fintech/)
  on fintech titled “Mapping Fintech to the Financial Planning Process - Why Fintech
  is Not a Threat.” \n\n“Not a threat” meaning fintech provides an opportunity for
  financial advisors as opposed to eating a financial planner's lunch.\n\nThe FPA
  has done a commendable job assessing the landscape, asking the right questions,
  and separating out what really should concern financial planners. Disruptive moments
  are paired with opportunity and they’ve navigated this thoughtfully throughout the
  report.\n\n## Where the fintech ‘threat’ exists\n\nThe FPA is an industry body,
  so it’s natural that they focus on their members: financial planners. What was lacking
  in my opinion, however, was due focus on the end-client and how financial advisors
  should respond to a fractured landscape. Plus, there’s a misplaced assumption that
  people will continue to reliably turn to traditional financial advice in the future.\n\nSure,
  money that’s already advised may leak out to fintech challengers, but the bigger,
  unaddressed threat is technology beginning to capture clients and their assets before
  they ever become advised in the first place.\n\nI’m the CEO of a fintech, so my
  opinion is biased, but if you’re a financial planner reading this white paper and
  learning a bunch of new stuff about technology - you’re in trouble. Certainly in
  trouble when it comes to new client acquisition and engaging a younger audience.\n\nThose
  [professionals using Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/) tend to be the
  most open to using new client-led technologies. With that in mind here are some
  of our takeaways, taking into account our experience as a fintech:\n\n## Why financial
  planners need to focus on client engagement\n\nThe very nature of our solution means
  that it works best when shared with the end-client, and suits clients needing constructed
  portfolios of listed securities. In other words, [advisors using Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/financial-advisors/)
  are already off-platform, tend to be independent or family offices, and usually
  rely on engagement to prove a fee for service model.\n\nThe FPA report highlights
  client engagement throughout:\n\n*While process matters, engagement and the connection
  to the financial planner is a key element to the enhancement of the financial planning
  process as viewed from the lens of the client. For the fintech industry to present
  their most significant contribution in the area of engagement uplift presents the
  financial planner with an exceptional technological opportunity to engage clients.*\n\nWhat
  strikes us about our [advisor partners at Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/financial-advisors/)
  is their willingness to use a wide spectrum of web-based solutions, especially mainstream,
  off-the-shelf tech. Put another way: a mobile-first product from Silicon Valley
  will be better than custom-built dealer-group software (I should know, I used to
  build custom software for financial advisors!). \n\n![Featured-Financial-Advisers-Fintech](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5xPFzaIUfei682GMMMuckO/fd20e39097e90f4c7064d5a966adca04/Featured-Financial-Advisers-Fintech.jpg?w=950)\n\nThe
  FPA report identified this nicely as well:\n\n*The financial planner authorised
  through a dealer group expects that such technology will come to his or her attention
  via the dealer group, though dealer groups rarely (if ever) has a fintech manager
  or lead investigating such technologies.*\n\nOperational technology is difficult
  for small businesses, especially those encumbered by strict regulation. We find
  that when we’re onboarding a financial advice client, we end up doing a bit of pro
  bono digital ops and marketing as well.\n\n## Fintech products can deliver a better
  fit for clients\n\nThe FPA does a nice job classifying fintechs, and giving examples
  of how some are deployed. They also acknowledge the [dizzying array of new products](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/where-sharesight-fits-in-fintech-australias-ecosystem-map/)
  coming to market. From the FPA:\n\n*What is lacking however is an understanding
  by financial planners, associations, AFSLs and regulators of what is available,
  how it works and whether or not these solutions actually deliver what they say they
  do or will.*\n\nOne thing the report doesn’t address is that once advisors start
  using these services, fintech solutions will have different levels of staff and
  client adoption not to mention very different product and service offerings -- this
  will be a mess operationally. \n\nThink of these like apps on your mobile phone,
  rather than all-in-one business software. At Sharesight, we know that the portfolios
  tracked by a certain client only represents a percentage of their total client base.\n\nProduct
  customisation typically won’t be an option either. Many advisors accustomed to the
  top-down model of enterprise software deployment are in for a surprise. Those leveraging
  fintech successfully will understand that fintechs solve 98% of a hyper-specific
  problem really well, and will bring themselves to ignore the remaining 2%.\n\nAdditionally,
  most fintechs operate at scale, some globally. Some may send staff to an advisor’s
  office for in-person training, others may [respond via Twitter](https://twitter.com/sharesight).
  These service models will take some getting used to. That’s not to say fintechs
  don’t provide quality client service, but it’s worth keeping the price tag in mind
  when expecting a face-to-face meeting with a sales rep.\n\n## Getting a second opinion
  aka “Hey Google, what are the best investments?”\n\nWhile the FPA report covered
  client engagement well, they didn’t cover trends within the self-directed market
  (we note this was an FPA report). To be a successful financial advisor in the fintech
  age is to acknowledge what happens outside of their purview or when a prospective
  client leave their office. \n\nPeople Google everything and spend hours each day
  on social media apps. This means they’ll be targeted by a range of products by virtue
  of their browsing history (Spaceship super, anyone?).\n\nPlus, the experiences we
  have online these days are so much better than what traditional financial services
  offer. Try comparing booking a holiday on Airbnb with checking your super balance.
  Fintechs are exploiting this. The FPA (actually Matt Heine from Netwealth) did a
  nice job acknowledging something we’ve been saying:\n\n*There needs to be due attention
  paid by the financial planning profession. Clients are not comparing the services
  of a financial planner any longer to banks and institutions. Rather they are starting
  to compare all services to the information flow that is timely and relevant from
  Amazon, Facebook and Google. They engage with Uber, Menulog, Netflix, Virgin Active,
  the weather, Qantas, Red Energy, the Post Office, myGOV, Medibank, Opal, and just
  about every aspect of day to day life via technology including apps.*\n\n## What
  happens if these Fintechs, you know, talk to each other?\n\nThe FPA report identified
  fintech challengers in isolation, with each corresponding to a specific part of
  the advice chain. While that was mostly true, a trend we’re seeing - and helping
  to propagate - is increasing connectivity between challenger solutions.\n\nWe often
  hear incumbents talking about how fintech X or Y wants to put them out of business
  or take over a major share of someone’s “wallet.” In reality, fintechs are run by
  ex-financial services people hell-bent on fixing a specific problem. Since they’re
  operating at scale, they don’t care about things outside of a very narrow lens.\n\n##
  How financial planners can win with fintech\n\nAdvisors need to get digital fast.
  Their websites need to evolve from what amounts to a brochure into an engaging experience
  that captures prospects’ details. Advisors will also need to embrace a gradation
  of services. Some clients will still want to delegate everything, some will want
  more control. Advisor fee models will need to adapt to this.\n\n[Overnight disruption
  in financial services is an illusion](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/where-is-the-uber-of-australian-wealth-management/),
  but advisors will see fewer clients and asset flows as the industry comes under
  more pressure from all sides. Rather than viewing fintechs as a threat to their
  business, financial planners should take the time to examine the opportunity that
  they can bring. The time is now for financial planners to embrace fintechs.\n\n###
