:title: Sharesight connects to amscot Stockbroking and State One
:content: "The team at [Sharesight](/) are excited to announce that [amscot Stockbroking](/partners/amscot/),
  along with associated brands amscot Advisor Services & [State One Stockbroking](https://www.stateone.com.au)
  can now connect their trading accounts directly to Sharesight. They’ve joined the
  growing ecosystem of [Sharesight connected brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/sharesight_connect/)
  that use the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) to give their
  clients access to the comprehensive portfolio and tax reporting, dividend tracking
  and performance analysis offered by Sharesight. \n\n![Featured-Sharesight-amscot-stockbroking](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/19UTUYZqYeIGcaaQuKemYw/db2591b727cec1dc8141f5594668cc29/Featured-Sharesight-amscot-stockbroking.png?w=950)\n\nInvestors
  with amscot Stockbroking on the [amscot Value plan](https://www.amscot.com.au/Rates)
  can buy or sell shares on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) from just $9.90
  for trades up to $12,850 (or only 0.077% -- whichever is greater) which we think
  is great value and one of their key strengths in the Australian market.\n\nBoth
  amscot and State One clients can connect their trading accounts directly to Sharesight
  and gain access to [Sharesight’s performance tracking](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/),
  [tax reporting](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/), and our award-winning
  [connection to Xero](/xero/). This will import your trading histories, including
  past buys and sells, dividends, and corporate actions all across to Sharesight in
  just a few clicks. Ongoing trades get automatically recorded in Sharesight as well.\n\n<div
