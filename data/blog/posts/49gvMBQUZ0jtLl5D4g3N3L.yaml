The Firebug openly shares his investing strategies and goals, with monthly updates on how he’s tracking. He also interviews other young investors who are on their way to reaching financial independence, as well as industry leaders such as best-selling author Peter Thornhill and Sharesight’s own [Doug Morris](https://www.aussiefirebug.com/portfolio-reporting-sharesight/).
