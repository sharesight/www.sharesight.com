:title: The Australian Tax Office, big data, and you
:content: "Right now I’m sitting in the Qantas lounge at the Melbourne airport and
  everyone is watching me.\n\nNot literally. I’m just one of the many generic-looking
  guys working away on their laptops. But digitally, I’m bleeding out loads of information.
  \n\nMy travel itinerary and check in data has been fed into an algorithm that combined
  with my frequent flyer profile has ranked me in terms of how the airline will next
  market to me. My computer is connected to the Qantas wi-fi so in theory they could
  determine my age, interest, and income range.\n\nYou are a walking data generator,
  and this is potentially a future financial horror show. \n\nJust as for-profit corporations
  like Qantas leverage this to \"personalise\" your experience, the Australian Tax
  Office has begun watching you too.\n\n## The Australian Tax Office, big data, and
  you\n\nRecently the ATO and ASIC [announced](https://www.afr.com/news/ato-set-to-target-share-profits-in-latest-data-matching-crackdown-20181029-h179l9)
  they will begin big data analysis on four year’s worth of DIY investor share trades
  to sniff out tax cheats. That equates to 500 million trades. Mine are in there,
  and so are yours.\n\nNothing is a secret, think about it.\n\nYou use a highly regulated
  bank and online broker to trade shares. Those shares are listed on the ASX - an
  institution so vital to the Australian economy that a [2011 merger with the Singapore
  exchange was scuttled for national security reasons](https://www.smh.com.au/business/how-the-asx-sgx-merger-failed-20110421-1dqb2.html).
  The ownership and dividend ledger is maintained by share registries - also publicly
  listed companies. \n\n## The information the ATO holds on you\n\nIn the words of
  ATO Assistant Commission Kath Anderson, \"share information would complement records
  already held from brokers, share registries and exchanges.\"\n\nThat means they
  know everything. Except whether or not you were wearing pants when you made the
  trade (which assumes you have electrical tape on your computer camera of course).\n\nAside
  from [institutional dark pools](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp),
  there is no way to trades shares anonymously and it was only a matter of time before
  the ATO started mining the history. Our online broking partners have been telling
  us this for years.\n\nFortunately the ATO is being merciful. They’re giving investors
  the opportunity to correct genuine errors without incurring a penalty, including
  a 28 day period to respond in order to correct information.\n\nThey [do state, however](https://www.afr.com/news/ato-set-to-target-share-profits-in-latest-data-matching-crackdown-20181029-h179l9),
  that \"shareholders are advised to keep good records of their purchases and sale
  prices, as well as the cost of brokerage fees. Where part of shareholdings are sold,
  records about the remaining shares should be maintained, required when calculating
  capital losses or gains.\"\n\nThat’s basically the opening sentence of the [original
  Sharesight business plan](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/these-two-reasons-are-why-i-founded-sharesight/).\n\n##
  How Sharesight helps you avoid the ATO’s trap\n\nSharesight enables investors to
  track their [true performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/),
  and provides reliable [tax reporting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/improved-taxable-income-report-for-australian-investors/).
  In order to do this, we ask investors build an accurate record of their investment
  history. Where imitators ask you to create a quick and dirty watchlists, we go the
  extra mile by recreating your cost base history, including corporate actions, and
  by factoring in dividends. It’s available anywhere via a browser, it’s always up
  to date, and we’re an independent company unlinked to any financial institution.\n\n![Retail
  Food Group Performance 2018](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Z92bzIbzOkKYyYom2coeQ/6862fcc361f6cac48d4f86f17ee3ffae/Retail_Food_Group_Performance_2018.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  the vast majority of cases, we estimate that investors run afoul of the ATO due
  to poor record-keeping. Our software works hard to help you build your investment
  history and track your trading activity on an on-going basis so you’ll never be
  out of line.\n\nThere is no better way to stay on top of your portfolio’s history
  than by using Sharesight. If you’re at all unsure about how to handle something,
  use our sharing feature to bring your accountant into the fold.\n\nOur software
  is trusted by hundreds of thousands of investors and has been heavily tested by
  the the likes of PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG so they can use if for their clients.\n\n##
  Don’t fall into the ATO’s big data trap\n\nThe ATO is just one of many government
  departments getting in on big data. Almost anything that can be tracked these days,
  is tracked. If you’re doing something as common as share investing, it will pay
  to be [organised with Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-easy-steps-to-get-organised-at-eofy/)
  and stay out of the crosshairs of the ATO’s big data program. Sign up for a free
