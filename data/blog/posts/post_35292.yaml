  years ago my son Scott and I developed [Sharesight](/). We began by asking ourselves
  a few basic questions, which turned out to be awfully relevant for investors of
  all stripes.\n\nWhen you have finally paid off your mortgage and you ready to do
  some serious saving, where is the best place to put your hard earned cash? \n\nIn
  the bank? Debentures? Bonds? Buy a rental property? Or maybe you could stick it
  in the share market? Surely not the share market. Everyone has heard of the Wall
  Street crash and the periodic crashes that have followed.\n\nWhen I eventually became
  mortgage free I did some research to answer the big “where to invest” question.
  To my surprise I discovered that over the long term the share market was hard to
  beat despite the well-publicised crashes.\n\nNext question: Who should I use to
  manage my share investments? More research and another surprise. Most investment
  advisors struggle to outperform market averages. Worse still they charge like wounded
  bulls but provide you with a very basic record of your investments to say the least
  and no meaningful performance information at all.\n\nThe solution was obvious. I’d
  do everything myself. Problems solved. Well... not quite. Two things drove me nuts.\n\n1.
  Record keeping for tax and accounting purposes was a time-consuming pain in the
  neck.\n\n2. How could I be certain share market investing was the best option?Working
  out the true, annualise return on my shares was damn tricky. No wonder investment
  advisors don’t do this for their clients.\n\nTo solve these problems Scott and I
  developed Sharesight. Not just for me but for all investors who have the problems
  I did.\n\nIn Sharesight your record keeping is automated. Your trades, dividends,
  share splits, dividend reinvestments and much more are all recorded for you.\n\nYou
  will love our tax reporting and you can see the true annualised return of every
  share you own and for your total portfolio over any time period you choose.\n\nBut
  wait – there’s more. Sharesight has been going 7 years now and has developed a host
  of other features over that time. Many of them kindly suggested by our customers,
  so please [keep the feedback coming](https://community.sharesight.com).\n\n![Sharesight
