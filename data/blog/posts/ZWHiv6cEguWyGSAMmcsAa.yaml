:title: Where Sharesight fits in FinTech Australia’s ecosystem map
:content: "###### Update: [Fintech Australia](https://fintechaustralia.org.au/) has
  released an updated version of the [Fintech Australia member ecosystem map](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152543317@N06/37968432886/in/dateposted-public/),
  which now includes 162 fintech startups an increase of 43 over the original map.
  We've updated the image below to reflect the latest version of the map (you can
  find the original still [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152543317@N06/34645579553/in/dateposted-public/)).
  \n\nThe team at [Sharesight](/) is excited by Australia’s fintech industry body
  releasing their first [member ecosystem map](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152543317@N06/34645579553/in/dateposted-public/).
  The map illustrates where the 119 members fit within the Australian fintech ecosystem
  and how the various sub-sectors overlap and connect.\n \n“The map is arguably the
  best visual representation yet of our fintech industry, which is the largest startup
  sub-sector in Australia according to the most recent [Startup Muster survey](https://www.startupmuster.com/Startup-Muster-2016-Report.pdf),”
  said FinTech Australia CEO Danielle Szetho.\n \nThe ecosystem map shows that the
  Wealth & Investment sub-sector -- where Sharesight exists -- is Australia’s largest
  fintech innovation area.\n\n![37968432886 bb117a9585 k](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/dtUPyVfpjaUCY0Wug4Scm/ba6b7fe2eccef8c1a3531fd77cbdec64/37968432886_bb117a9585_k.jpg?w=950)\n\nSharesight
  is a [founding member of FinTech Australia](/blog/sharesight-founding-member-of-fintech-australia/)
  and earlier this year FinTech Australia named Sharesight the [2017 “Finnies” award
  winner](/blog/sharesight-wins-2017-finnies-award-for-excellence-in-industry-collaboration-partnerships/)
  for Excellence in Industry Collaboration and Partnerships (Australia). Sharesight
  is strongly committed to using [APIs](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) and
  open data architectures to establish beneficial partnerships with other fintech
  and industry players in the ecosystem, believing it creates the best outcomes for
  customers.\n\n<div align=\"center\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p

  services used to be an impenetrable, vertically integrated, bank-dominated industry.
  This is changing. If you think of this like a column of children’s’ blocks, it’s
  been toppled over and consumers now have the ability to rebuild it to their needs.
  We have work to do, but it is happening. We are 100% committed at Sharesight to
  being a part of the “Rebel Alliance” -- and partnering with others in the Australian
  fintech ecosystem.”\n\n>We are 100% committed at Sharesight to being a part of the
