:title: Announcing a new partner - Bank of Queensland
:url_slug: sharesight-bank-of-queensland
:content: |-
  We're excited to announce Bank of Queensland is now offering their clients access to [Sharesight](/). Bank of Queensland's unique owner-branch model is well suited to our values at Sharesight. BOQ serves the communities they operate in, just as we like to serve investors.

  ![Bank of Queensland + Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7oaMSko0M06Qu06Ek0m2wi/28bdd1799fe24f8a1aa04ac9f3064de9/featured_boq.png?w=950)

  Investors using [BOQ Trading](https://www.boq.com.au/personal/investing-and-superannuation/boq-online-share-trading) can link to Sharesight for performance tracking, tax reporting, and our award-winning connection to [Xero](/xero/). Portfolio histories, including past buys and sells, dividends, [DRPs](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/), and corporate actions are all available on Sharesight in just a few clicks. Ongoing trades are automatically recorded as well. It's easy to import portfolios from other brokers for a total wealth perspective.

  Bank of Queensland offers their clients low-cost brokerage rates, market leading research, charting, [mFunds](/blog/asx-mfund-now-available-on-sharesight/), and analytical tools for active traders. And with the addition of Sharesight, all investors -- those with a few shares and those [running an SMSF](/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/) -- will benefit from an easy-to-use, but powerful portfolio platform that connects to a growing ecosystem of investor-friendly applications. We focus on making it easy for investors to gain an accurate picture of their portfolioâ€™s performance and to end the [reliance of spreadsheets](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/) and manual efforts. Welcome Bank of Queensland clients!
