  July 2020 edition of the Sharesight20ASX monthly trading snapshot, where we look
  at the top 20 trades Sharesight users made on the ASX during the month. \n\nHere
  are July’s top 20 ASX trades.\n\n## Sharesight20 top 20 ASX trades July 2020\n\n![Sharesight20
  monthly snapshot ASX July 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2lJ1VLdWDBadUD0VLloqGI/aa1bc1c214f60376c683adf320541f21/Top20__ASX_month_July2020.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  July’s Sharesight20ASX snapshot, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) sector topped the
  list in both buy and sell trades, led by Zip Co (ASX: Z1P) and Afterpay (ASX: APT).
  Biotech giant CSL (ASX: CSL) also proved popular, likely due to increased hype around
  the company’s role in Covid-19 vaccine trials and manufacturing. As always, ETFs
  were in demand, with investors focusing less on bear-themed ETFs than in recent
  months, and instead betting on the long-term recovery of the economy. \n\nLet’s
  look at the news behind the key stocks in this month’s snapshot:\n\n### Zip Co Ltd
