:content: "Investors using [Wealthsimple Trade](https://help.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/1500003651162-What-is-Wealthsimple-Trade-)
  can automatically import historical and ongoing trades in Canadian and US stocks
  and ETFs, as well as any of the [cryptocurrencies supported by Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/).
  With support for [over 200 global brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  and automatically updated price and dividend information on more than 240,000 stocks,
  ETFs and [mutual funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-canadian-mutual-funds-with-sharesight/),
  Sharesight is the ultimate tool for Canadian investors to track *all of their investments
  in one place*. To learn more about how investors benefit from tracking their Wealthsimple
  Trade investments in Sharesight, keep reading. \n\n![Track Wealthsimple trades](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6aqbRFDV4d2hKmu01qgfSu/c085cfd08fdb7622811c9ab354c0656e/Track_Wealthsimple_trades.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is Wealthsimple Trade?\n\n[Wealthsimple Trade](https://help.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/1500003651162-What-is-Wealthsimple-Trade-)
  is Wealthsimple’s self-directed investment platform for Canadian investors. It offers
  two different types of accounts: Trade or Crypto. Trade accounts allow investors
  to buy and sell stocks and ETFs on Canadian exchanges, while Crypto accounts allow
  investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through a personal (non-registered) account.
  Sharesight supports automatic tracking for both Trade and Crypto accounts. \n\n##
  Why you should track Wealthsimple trades with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your Wealthsimple
  trades to Sharesight (along with the rest of your investments), you can easily [track
  your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/au/investment-portfolio-performance/)
  across different brokers, asset classes and over 40 global markets, including the
  **CNSX**, **CVE** and **TSE**. Investors also gain access to Sharesight’s advanced
  performance and [tax reporting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-ways-sharesight-helps-canadians-at-tax-time/)
  designed for the needs of self-directed investors. \n\nSharesight also offers a
  range of powerful reports for investors including Performance, Portfolio Diversity,
  Contribution Analysis, Multi-Period, Multi-Currency Valuation and Future Income
  (upcoming announced dividends). The ability to track cash accounts, property and
  [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio.\n\n### Track your dividend income\n\nUnlike other portfolio
  trackers, Sharesight automatically [tracks dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  (including [dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/))
  and takes this into account when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make a significant contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the value of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more than
  just capital gains in its performance calculations.\n\n![Canadian dividend stock
  example](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1z4oktldaDDnY5qbM1DRaG/ec481e599505ebd524556fc0cd8ef797/Canadian_dividend_stock_example.JPG)\n\n###
  Calculate your capital gains tax\n\nSharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/)
  is the ultimate CGT calculator for Canadian investors. The report automatically
  determines capital gains made on sold shares as per the [Canadian tax rules](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4037/capital-gains.html),
  eliminating the need for investors to make manual calculations, which can be complex
  and subject to error. Other convenient features include the ability to optimise
  your tax position by carrying losses forward, as well as a breakdown of your portfolio’s
  short-term and long-term capital gains and losses.\n\n## How to import your Wealthsimple
  trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight makes it easy to import your historical and ongoing
  Wealthsimple trades through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/au/contract_notes/)
  feature, which allows you to automatically import your ongoing trades to your Sharesight
  portfolio by having your trade confirmations forwarded to your unique portfolio
  email address. You can also import your historical trades using the Trade Confirmation
  Emails feature, however for bulk imports with a large number of trades, it is recommended
  you upload your trades via [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).\n\n##
