:url_slug: track-cash-accounts-in-sharesight
:content: "Using Sharesight, you can easily track the cash held in your brokerage
  account along with the rest of your investments – giving you a clear picture of
  your cash flow and showing you the amount of investable cash you have available
  at any given time. Investors who use [Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/) will
  benefit from the ability to integrate [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/au/)
  with any bank or brokerage cash accounts using Xero bank feeds, making it easy to
  track cash balances and display reconciled trades and payouts automatically. [Sharesight
  Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/) users can also take advantage of our integration
  with [Macquarie CMA](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-integrates-macquarie-cash-management-account/).
  To learn more about how investors can benefit from using Sharesight’s Cash Account
  feature, keep reading. \n\n![Track Cash Accounts along with the rest of your investments

  What is a cash account?\n\nAn investor’s \"cash account\" is an account held by
  their broker, where investors deposit money when they intend to trade. The broker
  will use funds in the cash account when an investor buys shares, mutual funds, or
  other investments on offer. This cash account is also the account a broker will
  deposit the proceeds from any sales made or dividends received.\n\n## How does the
  Sharesight Cash Account work?\n\nThe Sharesight Cash Account feature is available
  to Sharesight users on [Investor, Expert](https://www.sharesight.com/au/pricing/)
  and [Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/) plans. To [add a Cash Account](https://help.sharesight.com/au/creating-a-cash-account/)
  to your Sharesight portfolio, simply click on the ‘Add Holding’ dropdown menu on
  the Portfolio Overview page and select ‘Add Cash Account’. From there you can specify
  the name and currency of the Cash Account which will be tied to the portfolio (including
  its tax residency). You also have the option to connect a [Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-cash-fixed-interest-investments-via-xero/)
  account (for Investor, Expert or Pro users) or a [Macquarie CMA](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-integrates-macquarie-cash-management-account/)
  account (for Pro users).  \n\n![Sharesight link a cash account 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/pp1ajFLivyxLjbuJZXaG8/0e8d6db2ec6ec2784fc8bb84909cfcbf/Sharesight_link_a_cash_account_1.jpg?w=950)\n\nOnce
  you have [added transactions to the account](https://help.sharesight.com/au/adding-a-transaction-to-a-cash-account/),
  you can view the balance of the account at a glance on your Portfolio Overview page.
  \n\n**Note:** The value of your Cash Account is included when calculating your portfolio’s
  value, but does not impact the [percentage return figure](https://help.sharesight.com/au/performance_calculation_method/).\n\n###
  Automatically sync Cash Account transactions to your portfolio\n\nSharesight users
  can automatically sync transactions to a Cash Account/s, provided that the currency
  matches their portfolio currency. To enable this feature, simply click the ‘Settings’
  tab and choose ‘Basic details’. You will have the option to elect a Cash Account
  to automatically sync buy and sell trades, as well as a Cash Account to automatically
  sync payouts (dividends and distributions). \n\n![Sharesight cash account settings

  Investors may choose to elect different Cash Accounts for trades and payouts, or
  they can elect the same Cash Account, as seen in the example above. </small>\n\nTo
  sync historical transactions to your Cash Account, or to remove synced transactions,
  simply click into the Cash Account, select ‘Manage Synced Trades & Payouts’ and
  choose the relevant date range. \n\n## Why should investors track their cash accounts
  with Sharesight?\n\nWith Sharesight, investors can easily track their cash accounts
  alongside investments across multiple global markets, brokers and asset classes.
  Tracking a cash account helps you monitor the movement of your money (cash flow)
  into and out of your portfolio, and allows you to see your investable cash at any
  given moment. This gives you the complete picture of your investments including
  the value of cash you have on hand that is not fully invested. Investors who track
  Cash Accounts in their portfolio will also benefit from the ability to leverage
  Sharesight’s powerful suite of performance and tax reporting tools. \n\n### Determine
  your asset allocation\n\nSharesight’s [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculate-investment-portfolio-diversification-sharesight/)
  is an easy way for investors to determine their asset allocation and evaluate their
  investing strategy. The screenshot below, for instance, shows a portfolio with a
  59.68% weight in ordinary shares; 32.29% ETFs; 4.53% currency investments; and 3.50%
  cash. Should the investor feel that they are overweight in ordinary shares and underweight
  in cash, for example, they can rebalance their portfolio as necessary.\n\n![Sharesight
