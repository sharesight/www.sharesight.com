  ETFs and mutual/managed funds](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),
  Sharesight is the ultimate tool to track *all of your investments in one place*.
  \n\n![Automatically track Bell Potter trades](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3w8ChVJBLAsCgXewJFX2Wr/8c5c34c93412d7b1e82a242c682c858a/Automatically_track_Bell_Potter_trades.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is Bell Potter?\n\nFounded in 1970, [Bell Potter](https://bellpotter.com.au/)
  is an Australian full service broker that allows investors to invest in Australian
  and international stocks and ETFs. The broker gives investors access to stock research
  by CitiGroup and Morningstar, as well as an online platform that features daily
  market commentary, ASX announcements and custom watchlists. \n\n## Why you should
  track Bell Potter trades with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your Bell Potter trades
  to Sharesight (along with the rest of your investments), you can easily [track your
  investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/investment-portfolio-performance/)
  across different brokers, asset classes and over 40 global markets, plus access
  Sharesight’s advanced performance and [tax reporting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-australian-investors-at-tax-time/)
  designed for the needs of self-directed investors.\n\nUnlike the data provided by
  most brokers, Sharesight takes into account the impact of capital gains, dividends,
  brokerage fees and currency fluctuations when calculating returns – giving investors
  the full picture of their portfolio’s performance. Sharesight also offers a range
  of powerful reports for investors including [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/),
  [Multi-Currency Valuation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/)
  and [Future Income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/)
  (upcoming dividends). The ability to track cash accounts, property and even cryptocurrency
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio.\n\n### Track your dividend income \n\nUnlike other portfolio
  trackers, Sharesight automatically [tracks dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  (including [dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/))
  and takes this into account when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make an important contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the value of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more than
  just capital gains in its performance calculations.\n\n![track dividends with Sharesight

  Calculate your capital gains tax\n\nSharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  is the ultimate CGT calculator for Australian investors. The report automatically
  determines capital gains made on sold shares as per the [ATO rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/Templates/Content.aspx?pageid=30591),
  eliminating the need for investors to make manual calculations, which can be complex
  and subject to error. Other convenient features include the ability to optimise
  your tax position by choosing your sale allocation methods, as well as a breakdown
  of your portfolio’s short-term and long-term capital gains and losses. \n\n## How
  to import your Bell Potter trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight makes it easy to import
  your historical and ongoing Bell Potter trades through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/au/contract_notes/)
  feature, which allows you to automatically import your ongoing trades to your Sharesight
  portfolio by having your trade confirmations forwarded to your unique portfolio
  email address. You can also import your historical trades using the Trade Confirmation
  Emails feature, however for bulk imports with a large number of trades, it is recommended
  you upload your trades via [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
