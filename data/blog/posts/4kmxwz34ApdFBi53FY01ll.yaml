:content: "It’s time to get a fresh view on your investments. Whether that means refreshing
  your investing strategy, setting new goals or exploring new ways to become a better
  investor, Sharesight has you covered. In this article we share three tips and tricks
  to get increased visibility into your portfolio’s returns while also saving time
  and money managing your investments. Here’s how to get a fresh view on your investments
  in 2022. \n\n![Fresh view on investments in 2022](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/33AqWlSlW59KhnnZXtLHWe/cfe3e967aaed4598ec3f979897336d21/Fresh_view_on_investments_in_2022.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  View your total returns, including dividends\n\nIf you’re invested in stocks, ETFs
  or managed/mutual funds, chances are you receive some dividends or distributions
  throughout the year. What many investors don’t realise is that these payouts directly
  impact your returns and are an important factor to consider when [calculating your
  investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/).
  For this reason, properly [tracking your dividend income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  is one of the best things you can do to become a more informed investor and help
  set your investment goals for the year.\n\nDone manually, tracking dividends can
  be a tedious and time consuming task, requiring you to pull information from various
  paper documents or share registries. It becomes even more complicated if you have
  overseas investments that pay dividends in a foreign currency, which means your
  payments are impacted by the exchange rate.\n\nBy using a dedicated portfolio tracker
  that automatically tracks dividends like Sharesight, it’s easy to calculate dividend
  yield, and visualise the impact of dividends on your portfolio’s returns. For example,
  in the screenshot below you can see that dividends have contributed to 7.79% of
  this holding’s total returns. If you were to disregard the impact of dividends,
  looking only at capital gains, you would think your holding’s total returns were
  only 5.85%, as opposed to 13.64%. This is a big difference, and a key example of
  how knowing your true returns is essential for evaluating your portfolio’s performance
  and setting your investment goals.\n\n![Enbridge holding example 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7JgkqswJUxlTUi4GH7Lsh2/56d64ddef3664f6cbdc126b1e3947718/Enbridge_holding_example_1.jpg?w=950)\n\n<small>

  the holding’s total returns. </small>\n\n## Visualise portfolio diversity \n\nOne
  of the best defense mechanisms for any investor is to avoid concentration risk by
  diversifying the assets in your portfolio. This could mean shifting your portfolio
  away from purely individual equities to a balance of different asset classes, or
  expanding your investments into new countries, sectors and industries.\n\nWith Sharesight,
  you can easily determine your asset allocation using the [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  which shows how your portfolio is diversified across different investment types,
  industry and sector classifications, markets and countries. Sharesight users also
  have the option to create their own [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  that align with their specific investment strategy or asset allocation target, which
  makes it easy to track your portfolio against your target and rebalance your assets
  as needed.\n\n![Diversity Report example 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/574IH7mP4ntXeRCOmQgJa/cf272ba01834cf4f385c8c9bc21b0a6f/Diversity_Report_example_2.jpg?w=950)\n\n<small>

  </small>\n\nOnce you have established your asset allocation, running Sharesight’s
  [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  will give you a clear picture of how your asset classes are actually performing.
  This will help you evaluate the success of your investment strategy and determine
  whether it needs to be revised in the coming year.\n\n![Contribution analysis example

  contribution to overall returns. </small>\n\n## See how you perform against benchmarks\n\nIn
  times of market volatility, it’s important not only to track your investment performance,
  but to put that performance into context with the broader market. One way of doing
  this is by choosing a benchmark for your portfolio that aligns with your investment
  goals. For example, you may choose an ETF or fund that tracks a certain index, or
  one that tracks a basket of stocks in a particular industry that will give you a
  like-for-like comparison with your own portfolio.\n\nWhen benchmarking your portfolio,
  the idea is that you should aim to outperform the benchmark over the year. And if
  you find you are consistently underperforming compared to the benchmark, you may
  decide to direct your investments into the ETF or fund instead, which could be an
  easy way to earn better returns.\n\nIt’s simple to benchmark your portfolio with
  Sharesight’s portfolio tracker, which allows investors to track their portfolio
  against over [240,000 stocks, ETFs and managed/mutual funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)
  from around the world. As can be seen in the screenshot below, while the sample
  portfolio is outperforming its benchmark, it is still generally following the same
  market trends. In the case of an underperforming portfolio, this is a good way to
  determine whether your portfolio is underperforming due to your own investment decisions,
  or whether it has been caused by broader market events.\n\n![Portfolio benchmarking
