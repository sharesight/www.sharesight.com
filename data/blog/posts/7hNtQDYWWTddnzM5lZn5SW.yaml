:title: Top 10 Sharesight blog posts of 2020
:content: "After a year marked by major corrections in markets around the world, and
  with a new year just around the corner, it’s time to look back  and revisit some
  of the most popular investing-related posts we’ve published on the Sharesight blog
  in 2020.\n\nGiven the turbulent market conditions investors experienced this year,
  it makes sense that our most-read post was about how to use Sharesight to navigate
  market volatility. This, along with posts about dividend tracking, calculating capital
  gains and our top 10 investing movies all made this year’s list.\n\n![top blogs
  2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4eMS94iTF34fiLjq0LTtPW/fa86b1ed18b1c65ca2eb20ff3c01c4af/top_blogs_2020.png?w=950)\n\nHere
  are some of Sharesight’s top blog posts from 2020:\n\n## 1. [4 ways to navigate
  market volatility with Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/4-ways-to-navigate-market-volatility-with-sharesight/)
  \ \n\n2020 was the ultimate year for market volatility, from the skyrocketing success
  of BNPL stocks and US tech giants, to the plummeting share prices of airlines and
  hotels across the world. Thankfully, Sharesight has a number of clever features
  to help you keep track of your performance in a volatile market, including detailed
  performance reports, [benchmarking](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/),
  portfolio sharing and the ability to [track capital gains and losses](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/).
  \n\n## 2. [How I use Sharesight as an investor](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-use-sharesight-as-an-investor/)\n\nSharesight
  executive chairman Andrew Bird shares some tips on how DIY investors can get the
  most out of Sharesight, including how he uses Sharesight to track his own investment
  portfolio. Some of his suggestions include ensuring all of your holdings are imported
  (even [custom investments](https://help.sharesight.com/unquoted-instruments/) such
  as [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)),
  [benchmarking your portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/),
  setting up [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  and running a [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/).
  \n\n## 3. [How to track monthly dividend income from your investments](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-monthly-dividend-income-from-your-investments/)\n\nIf
  you’re a dividend income or dividend growth investor, it’s important to be able
  to track the impact of dividends on your portfolio over time. While there are a
  number of ways to track dividends in Sharesight, this blog post shows how one Sharesight
  user tracks his dividend income on a monthly basis using the [Future Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/).
  \n\n## 4. [How Sharesight calculates your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)\n\nUnlike
  most brokers, Sharesight takes into account the impact of things like [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/),
  [currency fluctuations](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/intraday-foreign-exchange-rates-now-on-sharesight/)
  and the timing of inflows and outflows on your portfolio, giving investors a true
  picture of their portfolio’s performance. This blog post lists all of the factors
  Sharesight takes into consideration when calculating investment performance, and
  how these factors affect your portfolio’s returns. \n\n## 5. [Capital gains tax
  on shares in Australia - explained](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-on-shares-in-australia--explained/)\n\nTaxing
  capital gains on investments is a common practice throughout the world, but Australia’s
  capital gains regulations are some of the most complex. This blog post explains
  the various methods and requirements for calculating capital gains tax on Australian
  shares. \n\n## 6. [How much money do you need to save for retirement?](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-save-for-retirement/)\n\nOne
  of the main reasons people choose to invest is to build wealth for retirement. However,
  it can be difficult to determine how much money you will actually need when that
  time comes. This blog runs through the most important factors to consider in your
  retirement goals, and offers some tips on calculating how much money you will need.
  \n\n## 7. [How to get the most out of Sharesight’s performance tracking features](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-performance-tracking-features/)\n\nSharesight
  has a range of useful features designed to meet the needs of self-directed investors.

  reports; plus how to [export any Sharesight report](https://help.sharesight.com/exporting-a-report/)
  to an Excel, Google Sheets or PDF file format. \n\n## 8. [Explore your portfolio
  performance with the Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)\n\nSharesight’s
  Contribution Analysis Report displays how each holding inside a user’s portfolio
  contributes to their overall portfolio performance. Used in tandem with [Custom
  Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  it becomes a powerful tool that shows the components driving your returns, such
  as asset allocation or exposure to particular countries, sectors or industries.

  to get a better understanding of their portfolio’s performance. \n\n## 9. [Brokerage
  fees and your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/brokerage-fees-and-your-investment-performance/)\n\nWhen
  calculating your investment performance, [one of the factors Sharesight takes into
  consideration](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  is the impact of brokerage fees. This post explains why it is important to consider
  fees when calculating performance, and uses the latest data to show how much of
