:title: Sharesight adds 17,000 OTC equities and NYSE American market
:url_slug: sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market
:content: "Today we’re pleased to announce the addition of 3 more global stock markets
  to [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/) - adding historical, daily and intraday
  prices for more than 17,000 Over-The-Counter (OTC) equities and the third largest
  stock exchange in the USA - the NYSE American market (AMEX). With support for [more
  than 40 global markets](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),
  including leading US markets, Sharesight is the ultimate place for investors to
  track *all of their investments in one place*. \n\n![featured amex-otc-otcbb](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6flzOvpMD6QqEYGYQmCcqM/37d354f7266e80d7300e425e3764a117/featured_amex-otc-otcbb.png?w=950)\n\n##
  What is the NYSE American (AMEX)?\n\nThe [NYSE American exchange](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-american)
  (also known as the NYSE MKT), previously the ‘American Stock Exchange’ (AMEX) is
  the third largest stock exchange in the USA. It handles about [10% of all securities
  traded in the USA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amex.asp) and caters for
  growing companies, typically small caps as well as ETFs.\n\nNYSE American support
  adds nearly 400 additional trackable instruments to Sharesight. Sharesight also
  supports [15 minute delayed pricing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/)
  for the NYSE American market, giving investors the up-to-date price and performance
  information they need to make better investment decisions. You can find NYSE American
  instruments within Sharesight by searching for the ‘AMEX’ market code.\n\n## What
  are Over-The-Counter (OTC) equities?\n\n“Over-The-Counter” equities are typically
  stocks, though they can include derivatives and debt securities, as well as [American
  Depositary Receipts (ADRs)](https://www.otcmarkets.com/learn/american-depositary-receipts)
  that trade via dealer networks instead of on centralised exchanges (such as the
  NYSE). Because OTC equities don’t usually meet the listing requirements of centralised
  exchanges, OTC equities are also known as unlisted stock. \n\nStocks traded Over-The-Counter
  tend to be those of smaller companies (‘penny stocks’) with less liquidity than
  stocks listed on the major exchanges.\n\n### Other OTC (OTC)\n\nThe Other OTC Issues
  market (sometimes known as the [Pink Sheets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp),
  or OTCMKTS if you’re coming from [Google Finance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-your-google-finance-portfolio-into-sharesight/))
  tracks around 17,000 Over-The-Counter equities. If you’re an investor in OTC equities
  it’s very likely that you will find them here. When [adding a holding](https://help.sharesight.com/setting-up-your-holdings/)
  for this market within Sharesight, you can search using the ‘OTC’ market code.\n\n###
  OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB)\n\nThe [Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTC_Bulletin_Board)
  is a market operated by the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Industry_Regulatory_Authority),
  and it currently tracks around 50 stocks. Companies listed on the OTCBB are required
  to report (current with SEC filings) but have no size, governance or other requirements.
  You can search for these holdings within Sharesight using the ‘OTCBB’ market code.\n\n![Screen

  [FREE Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup).\n2. [Add your
  holdings](https://help.sharesight.com/getting-started-with-sharesight/) to your

  are announced).\n\n### Already tracking these holdings in Sharesight?\n\nIf you
