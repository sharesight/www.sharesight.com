:title: Sharesight partners with Hatch
:content: "Sharesight is excited to be working with leading New Zealand digital investment
  platform [Hatch](https://www.hatchinvest.nz/) who have made it easy for investors
  to sync their full trading history with Sharesight’s portfolio tracker. \n\nHatch,
  based in Wellington (just like Sharesight) launched in 2018 to enable investors
  in New Zealand access to world class investments and grow their wealth by investing
  in markets worldwide.\n\nBy working with Sharesight, investors trading with Hatch
  will be able to track all their holdings in one place and take advantage of [Sharesight’s
  investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  and [powerful tax reports](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-nz-investors-at-tax-time/),
  built specifically for the needs of investors in New Zealand.\n\n![Sharesight partners

  Hatch connects to the Sharesight API\n\nThis was all made possible through Sharesight’s
  powerful [API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) that allowed Hatch to quickly
  develop a solution that would allow investors to push their trading history directly
  into Sharesight. \n\n\"From start to finish, our development team was able to build,
  test, and release our Sharesight integration within 2 months\" said Hatch Head of
  Product, Natalie Ferguson.\n\n\"As a fellow New Zealand fintech we were really excited
  to work with the team at Sharesight to make tax time easy for Kiwi investors. The
  FIF calculations are no longer a barrier to diversifying our investments globally
  from New Zealand\"\n\n![Connect Hatch to Sharesight portfolio tracker](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2J1QoouhgGzExl0ny79Z7f/aec0d363c2c5db8671a384025df4b4c1/Connect_Hatch_to_Sharesight_portfolio_tracker.png?w=950)\n\nInvestors
