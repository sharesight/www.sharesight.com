  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIn this Sharesight20
  yearly trading snapshot we look at the 20 most traded stocks by Sharesight users
  on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX - also known as TSE in Sharesight) in 2019 and
  how these stocks performed during the year.\n\nLet’s dive into 2019’s top 20 trades.\n\n##
  Top 20 Toronto Stock Exchange trades in 2019\n\n![Top 20 trades on the Toronto stock

  Click image to zoom</small>\n\nInvestors using Sharesight traded Toronto Dominion
  Bank (TSE: TD) more often than any other stock listed on the TSE in 2019. Among
  the 5 most traded stocks, 3 were large financial institutions (TSE: TD, BNS & RY),
  one an energy company, Enbridge Inc (TSE: ENB), plus Vanguard’s *FTSE Canada All
  Cap Index* tracking ETF (TSE: VCN).\n\nInvestors also bought into the emerging theme
  of Cannabis/Marijuana related stocks in 2019 - with both Aurora Cannabis Inc. (TSE:
  ACB) and Canopy Growth Corporation (TSE: WEED) breaking into the 20 most traded
  stocks on the exchange.\n\nNow let’s look at the performance of these stocks in
  2019.\n\n## Top 20 TSE trades in 2019 - performance\n\nTo calculate the performance
  of these stocks during 2019 we built a Sharesight portfolio domiciled in the same
  country as the exchange (to remove the impact of currency fluctuations) that contained
  these 20 stocks and invested an equally weighted (5% of the total portfolio) amount
  in each stock on January 1st 2019 (or the first listed date for stocks that listed
  after that date).\n\nWe then ran [Sharesight’s Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  to calculate the portfolio’s 2019 performance. Here’s the results, ordered by Total
  Return.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Code</th>\n    <th>Name</th>\n    <th>Capital

  \ </tr>\n</table>\n\nCanadian ecommerce giant Shopify (TSE: SHOP) was the standout
  performer with returns of 173.61% in 2019. The top dividend performer was Enbridge
  Inc (TSE: ENB) with a healthy dividend yield of 6.97%.\n\nOf the 20, Canopy Growth
  Corporation was the only stock to record negative returns during the year, with
  the stock down 25.44% during the period.\n\nAn equally weighted portfolio of these
  20 stocks would have returned 25.86%, slightly outperforming an index tracking ETF
  such as Vanguard’s *FTSE Canada All Cap Index* ETF (TSE: VCN) which returned 22.02%.\n\n
