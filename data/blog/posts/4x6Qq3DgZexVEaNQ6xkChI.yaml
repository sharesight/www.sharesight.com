:title: 4 things investors need to know about dividend investing
:content: "With the outlook for dividend income uncertain due to the impact of COVID-19,
  it’s more important than ever for investors to stay on top of their portfolio, especially
  if dividends factor into their retirement plans. Investors with self-managed super
  funds (SMSFs) who are reliant on dividend income need to ensure they are in the
  best position to ride out economic volatility, but it will require careful management
  of their investments, including [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and accurately calculating the tax implications of capital gains and franking credits.
  \n\n![trackdividends](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/18vwpMMA85j7nbTqVTRb2Q/3aedf33dc2a10d660c77cc8304518256/dividend_investing.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Dividend investing: No longer a safe-haven\n\nDividend investing has long been a
  favourite of Australian investors. It’s a simple concept: Pick some blue-chip stocks
  with high dividends that include franking credits, hold onto them and collect the
  payments. While this generally a good strategy when the economy is going strong,
  it can come undone in the midst of an economic downturn. \n\nFor example, while
  the big banks have historically been associated with steady, sizeable dividend payments,
  the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) has recently imposed a 50%
  cap on dividend payout ratios for this year’s second-half earnings. Not only are
  investors looking at reduced dividend payments in general, but it is likely that
  many companies may forgo dividend payments altogether. \n\nIn this case, investors
  could benefit from a portfolio tracking solution that allows them to keep up-to-date
  on changes in their dividend payments, while also allowing them to forecast their
  future income based on portfolio positions. \n\n## Keeping track of cash from dividends\n\nInvestors
  with large, diversified portfolios will find that keeping track of where dividends
  are coming from and how they impact the portfolio can be an admin nightmare. \n\nListed
  companies, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and managed funds outsource the responsibility
  of tracking who owns shares and who is paid dividends to share registries, of which
  there are six in Australia. This means that to get an accurate record of dividends
  received across an investment portfolio, investors will often need to gather dividend
  data from the websites of multiple registries or pour over mailed dividend statements
  for each holding. \n\nIn the best-case scenario, investors may have their dividends
  deposited into the same account they use for brokerage. However, the broker has
  no visibility on the source of this cash, so they won’t be able to calculate the
  dividend yield from it. \n\nInvestors can do this manually in a spreadsheet, but
  it is time-consuming and becomes increasingly complex as the portfolio grows. Using
  a dedicated software solution that automates dividend tracking can take the time
  and effort out of keeping up to date, and gives investors an accurate picture of
  their dividend yield and portfolio return. \n\n## Dividends and their tax implications\n\nKeeping
  track of the income from dividends is one thing, but for many investors, particularly
  those with SMSFs, it’s crucial to understand the impact of franking credits on dividend
  income and how this affects tax returns. Dividends aren’t just classified as taxable
  income either. Some can actually change your cost-base and need to be recorded properly.\n\nIn
  trying to calculate the tax implications of franking credits, looking at the bank
  account the share registry deposits dividends to will be of little help, because
  it only lists the net amount paid. Going to the share registry for information is
  a good start, but the registries fall short in two ways: For one thing, you will
  likely still need to rely on multiple registries to compile a portfolio-wide tax
  picture; and secondly, they will sometimes only provide you with the most recent
  financial year’s data for free, charging you a fee if you need access to information
  from previous years.\n\nTo avoid this long-winded and messy process, investors should
  seek a portfolio tool that automatically records franking credits and allows them
  to simply calculate the taxable income on their investments. This will become infinitely
  valuable at tax time, saving investors the headache of chasing records and trying
  to ensure accuracy. \n\n## The impact of dividend reinvestment\n\nSome share registries
  will allow investors to automatically [reinvest their dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  in the companies that issue them, which is a good way to build wealth in a portfolio
  without encountering brokerage fees. However, DRPs can create an added layer of
  complexity when trying to calculate the true return of your portfolio. \n\nBecause
  the DRP is managed by the share registry, brokers have no visibility into dividends
  that are reinvested. This means the investor must keep track of this. In addition,
  when dividends are reinvested, shares are bought at whatever the market price is
  at the time (sometimes with a discount). This means that the cost base and the amount
  invested is constantly changing and will have tax implications when calculating
  capital gains tax (CGT), should you ever decide to sell the shares. It also makes
  it difficult to calculate the true performance of a portfolio, as any return calculations
  are reliant on the cost base. \n\nOnce again, this would require quite some time
  and effort to track via a spreadsheet, for example, especially as this is only one
  of many metrics an investor needs to track if they want to effectively manage an
  SMSF or track the returns of a dividend investing strategy. An automated solution
  could make this process vastly more efficient and give clarity on a portfolio’s
  true returns. \n\n## Dividends can be an investor’s best friend with Sharesight\n\nDone
