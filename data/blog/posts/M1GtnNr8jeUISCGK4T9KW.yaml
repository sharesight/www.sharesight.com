:title: What is a real estate investment trust (REIT)?
:url_slug: real-estate-investment-trust-reit
:content: "Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are listed investment vehicles popular
  with Australian investors because they are both easy to access and can provide a
  regular income stream from an asset class which is usually different to the rest
  of their portfolio. This diversification feature is important when constructing
  any equity or fixed-income portfolio and the potential for REITs to deliver dividend
  income, often whilst taking on less risk than a share portfolio, makes these trusts
  well worth considering.\n\n![Real Estate Invesment Trust (REIT)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5EmjVao66Imdq3DxEnvmyU/6f23c9ed906c07389ff088bd249148dc/Real_Estate_Invesment_Trust__REIT_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a REIT?\n\nREITs offer investors an alternative to direct property investing
  by offering exposure to the property market through their stock portfolio. These
  trusts are actively managed and, like managed funds, pool together investor capital.
  Investors can use REITs to access a property portfolio which may include commercial,
  industrial, retail or a mix of these real estate assets, which are not generally
  available to individual investors. Commercial properties like offices, apartment
  buildings, shopping centres and hotels are particularly popular with investors.
  REITs may either invest in property locally or internationally. In Australia, REITs
  are known as A-REITs and are [traded on the ASX](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/trade-our-cash-market/asx-investment-products-directory/areits#Australia).\n\nWhile
  REITs have the characteristics of other investment trust structures, some have a
  \"[stapled security](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stapled-securities-with-sharesight/)\"
  mechanism that consists of two or more securities (usually a company and a trust)
  that are contractually bound to form a single unit. Stapled securities are therefore
  legally bound together so that they can't be sold separately. In the case of REITs,
  many property trusts have their units stapled to the shares of companies with which
  they are closely associated. Although the stapled security must be dealt with holistically,
  the individual securities that are stapled are treated separately for tax purposes.
  Such structures can provide higher growth opportunities but also be a higher risk
  investment than a traditional REIT, while potentially having extra tax implications
  for investors.\n\n## Costs of REITs\n\nREITs are generally run by specialist property
  managers, responsible for selecting investment properties and managing tenants,
  maintenance and rental. This professional management can potentially offer [significant
  benefits but comes at a cost](https://www.canstar.com.au/investor-hub/explainer-reits/),
  with management fees that may include both a base fee and a performance fee. There
  may also be additional fees such as acquisition and divestment fees. REITs which
  hold properties in foreign jurisdictions may also be subject to taxation by the
  relevant jurisdictions. Investors can find information on these fees in the REITs’
  prospectuses and financial statements.\n\n## Types of REITs\n\nGlobally there are
  [many types of REITs](https://www.jbwere.com.au/blog/2017/03/what_are_reits_), which
  can be broadly classified by how they are traded (private versus public), type of
  assets (equity versus mortgage) and by sectors they operate in (retail, commercial,
  industrial). Initially, REITs in the US were primarily mortgage companies, investing
  in the debt used to finance real estate development. From there, equity REITs also
  gained popularity with investors who wanted to receive rental and gain income rather
  than mortgage payments. Asset classification remains a key division in the present
  with Equity REITs owning properties that provide lease income to unitholders; Mortgage
  REITs holding mortgage notes on properties, which allows them to collect principal
  and interest payments from the mortgage holders; and Hybrid REITs, which share characteristics
  of both of the others.\n\n**Most REITs specialise in one or just a few sectors,
  with REITs falling into the following common categories:**\n\n* **Office REITs**
  – owning and/or managing commercial office real estate and leasing space in these
  properties to tenants or managing office buildings owned by third parties\n\n* **Retail
  REITs** – owning and leasing retail space in shopping centres and similar assets\n\n*
  **Industrial** – owning warehouses, factories and industrial parks and earning rental
  and management income from these industrial facilities\n\n* **Hotel and leisure
  REITs** – owning and / or operating hotels, cinemas and theme parks and, in some
  cases, leasing space in these properties to retailers and long-term tenants\n\n*
  **Specialty REITs** – these REITs own and collect rent from a mixed bag of properties
  such as childcare centres, caravan parks, old age homes and medical centres\n\n*
  **Diversified REITs** – a mixture of the above\n\n## Benefits of REITs\n\nREITs
  offer investors [instant access to a large property portfolio](https://www2.asx.com.au/investors/learn-about-our-investment-solutions/a-reits)
  for a small upfront investment and may also offer diversification across property
  sectors, geographical locations and asset types. Even within the property sector,
  REITs tend to invest in a wide variety of property assets – offices, hotels, medical
  centres – with a spread of tenant types and lease maturities. While the value of
  these property assets may increase the net asset value of the REIT, these investment
  vehicles are primarily designed to provide a sustainable income stream, with monthly
  or quarterly distributions underpinned by regular rental income. However, it is
  important to note that higher income may involve higher risk.\n\nBy comparison to
  a direct residential or commercial property investment, REITs can be easily bought
  and sold on the ASX, like shares. And unlike direct property, they offer investors
  the ability to gradually build or sell part of your investment, rather than buying
  or selling an entire property. Further, REITs are professionally managed, either
  by an in-house team or a third-party property management firm, and therefore the
  individual investor does not need to worry about handling any property management
  functions.\n\n## Risks of REITs\n\nHowever, REITs aren’t riskless investments as
  all real estate can be [sensitive to macroeconomic factors and market cycles](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/a-reits-a-year-on-from-their-peak),
  impacting returns when the market environment worsens. Specifically, underlying
  assets like shopping centres may have high levels of debt, can lose major tenants
  or be poorly managed. The recent COVID lockdowns showed how susceptible office properties
  can be to staff working from home while increased on-line shopping and weak retail
  discretionary spending activity can have a big impact on retail rental conditions
  and demand for hotel rooms.\n\nWhile most REITs allow investors to diversify their
  portfolios, this point can be oversold given that some REITs concentrate exclusively
  on a few large assets or a single sector, leading to higher risks. Another potential
  risk occurs when REITs borrow funds to buy or develop a property portfolio, creating
  high levels of gearing. While gearing can multiply capital gains when asset values
  rise, it can also multiply losses when they fall, as well as creating higher interest
  costs. Similar to a managed fund, it is vital that investors do their due diligence
  and examine the management team behind the investment. Be sure to look at the level
  of debt a trust holds.\n\n## What are the differences between REITs and unlisted
  property trusts?\n\n[Unlisted property trusts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/the-essential-guide-to-investing-in-unlisted-property-trusts/)
  also offer investors access to commercial property and professional management,
  but the value of the investment is primarily influenced by movements in the commercial
  property market rather than by the broader share market. This can mean less volatility
  in the investment. There are two types of unlisted property trusts, open-ended property
  funds and fixed-term, closed-end property trusts (often referred to as syndicates).\n\n##
