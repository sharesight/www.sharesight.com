:title: How to track your asset allocation strategy in Sharesight
:content: "Legendary hedge fund manager [Ray Dalio wrote recently](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/diversifying-well-most-important-thing-you-need-do-order-ray-dalio)
  that \"diversifying well is the most important thing you need to do in order to
  invest well\". In order to diversify well, investors need to master one of the [key
  methods of portfolio diversification -  asset allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/investment-diversification-why-does-it-matter/).\n\nIn
  this post, we’ll examine how to actually keep your asset allocation on target using
  Sharesight.\n\n![How to track your asset allocation strategy in Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/e3vwWmtmIKkRmNXFn4MaJ/e493f3dbbdf7b06a9c2ec245265b64b9/How_to_track_your_asset_allocation_strategy_in_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Tracking asset allocation with Sharesight’s Custom Groups feature\n\nWhen running
  [Sharesight’s Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/),
  the default reporting groupings are based on one of six criteria: Market, Sector
  classification, Industry classification, Investment type, Country or no grouping
  at all. \n\nInvestors can, however, take a different approach to defining their
  asset allocations outside the six default criteria groups by using [Sharesight’s
  Custom Groups feature](https://help.sharesight.com/au/custom-groups/).\n\nUsing
  Custom Groups, an investor is able to assess how their portfolio is tracking against
  a self defined asset allocation target at a given point in time.\n\n### Example
  asset allocations at various risk levels\n\nAn example of asset allocations that
  align to a particular investment strategy (in this case based on risk tolerance)
  as described by Graham Hand in this [blog post](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-build-a-long-term-portfolio-in-listed-markets/)
  is below.\n\n| &nbsp;     | Conservative     | Balanced     | Aggressive     |\n|
  ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Risk
  horizon</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2 years</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">5
  years</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">8 years</span> |\n| &nbsp;            |
  &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  |\n| Australian shares\t| 6       | 20      | 30      |\n|
  Global shares     | 6       | 20      | 35      |\n| Listed property   | 3       |
  5       | 10      |\n| Australian bonds\t| 30      | 20      | 10      |\n| Global
  bonds      |\t20      |\t10      |\t5       |\n| ‘Alternatives’    |\t5       |\t5
  \      |\t5       |\n| Cash              |\t30      |\t20      |\t5       |\n| <span
  style=\"font-weight:bold;\">TOTAL</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">100</span>
  | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">100</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">100</span>
  |\n| &nbsp;            | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  |\n| Growth Assets     | 20
  \     |\t50      |\t80      |\n| Income Assets     |\t80\t    | 50      |\t20      |\n\n###
  Tagging holdings using Custom Groups\n\nUsing the above asset allocation groupings
  we could create the following in Sharesight: \n\n![Asset allocation custom groups](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5IoCOiIXXRGC3ujqSunWxW/7ecc05e49b6e91699ff1d416f7fcec01/custom-groups-asset-allocation.png?w=950)\n\nBy
  tagging holdings in a particular custom group, an investor could then run the diversity
  report to see how they are progressing against their planned asset allocation --
  then adjust their allocation by either investing more in assets that are under allocated,
  or selling assets that are over exposed.\n\n![Diversity Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/35eYHXpeabZT8M3ylK5xPY/74b6e68231a7beee53d3ff44bd097202/Diversity_Report.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  diversity report of individual components of a Custom Group looks like the below.\n\n![Custom
  Group Income Earnings](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/IaH13TEcsYemOnHnq6U4R/2ddc051ccceefc5e119a4127f3a08ccb/Custom_Group_Income_Earnings.png?w=950)\n\nInvestors
  can also explore which asset classes are contributing to their overall portfolio
  performance by running Sharesight’s [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/):\n\n![Asset
  Allocation Contribution Analysis](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/73c1KteN1bfhKG0JX5ofgg/9958bc179fda2dda0181a2b61679c077/Asset_Allocation_Contribution_Analysis.png?w=950)\n\n##
