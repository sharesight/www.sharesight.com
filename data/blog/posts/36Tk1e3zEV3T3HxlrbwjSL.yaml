  April 2020 edition of the Sharesight20 monthly trading snapshot, where we look at
  the top 20 trades on both the ASX and NZX made by Sharesight users during the month.
  After a particularly volatile March, Sharesight users looked for value opportunities,
  as well as showing continued interest in bear themed ETFs.\n\nHere’s April’s top
  ASX and NZX trades.\n\n## Sharesight20 top 20 ASX trades April 2020\n\n![Top20 ASX
  trades April 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5fRPPC0k7PrVf2LrVWmrKK/72789eada3ac0525cbd22085e06e93f5/Top20__ASX_trades_April_2020.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  April’s Sharesight20ASX snapshot the crown for the most traded stock again went
  to S&P ASX 300 index tracking ETF Vanguard Australian Shares (ASX: VAS) with investors
  considering recent falls in the index as a good opportunity to pick up the index
  at a discount. Interest in the two bear themed ETFs we first saw in March (ASX:
  BBOZ) & (ASX: BBUS) fell away slightly, though we also saw the BetaShares crude
  oil ETF (ASX: OOO) break into the monthly snapshot for the first time. \n\nLet’s
