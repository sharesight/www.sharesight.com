:content: "I read with great interest an [article](http://www.pressdisplay.com/pressdisplay/showlink.aspx?bookmarkid=6HBRJ710WH1)
  in the Dominion Post on 13 May which featured the responses from four investing
  professionals who were asked to address this issue. It has been an uphill battle
  to persuade Kiwi investors to give the share market the attention it deserves and
  I was keen to see if investment advisors are part of the problem or the solution.\n\nThe
  fact is that shares have consistently provided the best return over time so I would
  have expected that all 4 (possibly 3 given one was a trader rather than an investor)
  would have made share investment their starting point. This is not to say everyone
  should have all their investment funds in shares of course but if you are going
  to recommend an investment that is likely to give lower returns then there is surely
  a need to explain why. And one would expect the reason for not investing in shares
  to be addressed by whatever alternative investment is recommended.\n\nSo how did
  the investment advisors do against my criteria? Well, I was pleasantly surprised
  to see that two did in fact focus strongly on shares. And where an alternative was
  suggested good reasons were given. So to mix a couple of metaphors, maybe the tide
  will turn, we will see light at the end of the tunnel and more kiwis will invest
  in shares.\n\nI do have a couple of quibbles. One advisor suggested retired investors
  should generate all required income from fixed interest before considering shares.
  I think this is going too far especially for those with diversified portfolios which
  will generate reasonably reliable and consistent dividend returns. Some people will
  be retired for 25 years or more and this is a long time to be deprived of the higher
  returns shares are likely to provide. \n\nAnother advisor said that investing in
  managed funds rather than directly in shares usually provides higher returns at
  lower risk. I think this is a highly debateable statement to say the least. In my
  view a lot more should be being done to encourage Kiwis to invest directly in shares.\n\n<small>*This
