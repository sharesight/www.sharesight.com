:title: Sharesight20 January top 20 trades on ASX & NZX
:content: |-
  Last year we debuted the [Sharesight20 weekly trading snapshots](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/get-weekly-sharesight20-asx-nzx-trading-snapshots/), a weekly update of the top 20 shares traded by the Sharesight userbase on the ASX ([#Sharesight20ASX](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharesight20asx)) and the NZX ([#Sharesight20NZX](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharesight20nzx)) over the previous 7 days.

  We’ve since expanded on this with the Sharesight20 monthly trading snapshot ([click here for last month’s Sharesight20](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20-december-top-20-trades-on-asx-nzx/)), where we look at the top 20 trades on both the ASX and NZX markets among the Sharesight userbase during the current month and dig a little deeper into the news behind these movements.

  Let’s dive into January’s top trades.

  ## Sharesight20ASX January Snapshot

  The top 20 shares traded on the ASX during January are again a mix of resource companies, ETFs, plus a few outliers. The A2 Milk Company regained its most traded share status from the [November Sharesight20ASX snapshot](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20-november-top-20-trades-on-asx-nzx/) after a quiet December trading period where it fell out of [December’s Sharesight20ASX entirely](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20-december-top-20-trades-on-asx-nzx/).
