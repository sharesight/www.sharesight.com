:title: Diary of a small cap growth investor - Feb 2020 update
:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not
  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser or accountant
  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nPlenty has changed in the year
  or so since [I last shared a diary entry](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/diary-of-a-small-cap-growth-investor/)
  with you, but one thing that hasn’t changed is the importance of Sharesight in allowing
  me to be honest with myself by regularly reviewing my performance. It’s an essential
  habit for improving as an investor, but my online brokerage can’t help with it.
  That’s because when I sell a stock from my portfolio, it simply disappears, and
  I forget about how much I made -- or lost -- on the investment. \n\nAs I write this,
  we’re in the middle of reporting season, and a couple of my larger holdings have
  suffered share price drops on results. For example **EML Payments** (ASX: EML) dropped
  15%, leaving me considering whether I should sell some of my [EML Payments shares](https://arichlife.com.au/eml-payments-asxeml-1h-fy2020-results/)
  due to its optimistic valuation (and kicking myself for not having done so *before*
  the results).\n\nSo it was very grounding for me to see that, in actual fact, the
  last three months have been pretty kind to me. My portfolio has gained 8.8%, which
  is slightly better than the popular ASX 200 ETF that I use as a benchmark, as you
  can see below. In this case, getting the facts straight has helped me clear my mind.\n\n![Benchmark
  against the ASX](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/tVpGznF7kxgdsUYuhSmda/2152bf6e76777631543184526b6e4b06/Benchmark_against_the_ASX.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Which holdings let me down?\n\nOf course, that leaves me curious about *how* I’ve
  kept my head above water, and what has been dragging me down. For the last three
  months, you can see my worst four performing companies by absolute contribution
  (on the left) and by percentage fall (on the right):\n\n![Worst performing stocks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/341XvxaKaUv9prbgCtQf2T/4579467418d19a3e65f2070e00d808aa/Worst_performing_stocks.png?w=950)\n\nPrevious
  star performer **Pro Medicus** (ASX: PME) has been the biggest drag on my portfolio,
  as it has descended from heady heights achieved at the end of last year. Although
  I sold the majority of my holding at above current prices, it’s still a big holding,
  and a big drag when the share price falls. **Straker Translations** (ASX: STG) was
  the second biggest drag in absolute terms, in part because I added more as the share
  price has fallen. The market seems fairly unimpressed with the stock but you don’t
  beat the market by agreeing with it.\n\nIn percentage terms, **Gentrack** (ASX:
  GTK) was the worst loss, as it produced yet another disappointing update. I’ve finally
  sold out of that one completely, as you can see. Gentrack has been a bit of an embarrassment
  as it was one of my biggest losers when I wrote the last diary entry here, more
  than a year ago!\n\n## Which holdings performed best?\n\nInterestingly, while some
  mid-market growth stocks like Pro Medicus, **Ecofibre** (ASX: EOF), Gentrack and
  **Volpara** (ASX: VHT) have dragged me down lately, the micro-caps in my portfolio
  have held me up.\n\n![Best performing stocks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/iQPVmDrUoQYQwBuG5o9PG/6fcd8310c3cffe505f274dbe0ff1b010/Best_performing_stocks.png?w=950)\n\nI
  have a large position in **Kip McGrath Education Centres** (ASX: KME), so it doesn’t
  have to do a lot to make a difference. Meanwhile [Chant West (ASX: CWL) popped 40%
  in a day](https://arichlife.com.au/chant-west-holdings-asx-cwl-sells-its-goose/)
  when it agreed to sell one of its businesses for more than its previous market capitalisation!
  At the time of writing I am trying to sell shares in Chant West to take profits,
  and have an order in market, but have not yet succeeded.\n\n## Looking back over
  the longer term\n\nFinally, it’s always worth zooming out to get a little bit more
  perspective. Last time I took a 2-year view, but I like to look at my returns over
  a range of time periods. Today, let’s take a look at my 5-year returns:\n\n![Look
  back over the long term stock performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/66D8tfsN0k7YVqHRbL5OjQ/555d1c79fafb3bb31ca5bd2e94eb0627/Look_back_over_the_long_term_stock_performance.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  64% total return is a quasi annualised figure calculated using a money weighted
  methodology. This essentially credits me for the fact that I take money in and out
  of the market, and ignores the returns (or lack thereof) I make with cash. Because
  the amount of money I have in the market is constantly changing it’s not a true
  annualised figure in the sense a fund manager would report it, but it is a close
  proxy (assuming a minimal cash holding). \n\nIn some ways the absolute dollar figures
  are a more useful way to think about it. I have removed them from the graphic above
  for privacy, but the chart gives you a visual indication of how my  returns have
  been over 5 years. While 2016 was a tough year for me, with no progress made, 2019
  was an absolute cracker. It’ll come as no surprise that the short term loser Pro
  Medicus has been the big winner over both 1 year, and 5 year periods.\n\n## Take
  the time for an honest look back\n\nI imagine many sharesight users also had a great
  year in 2019 -- so congratulations. But whether it was a good year or not, I’d encourage
  you to take some time once in a while to take an honest look at the long term winners
  and losers in your portfolio. Only you will know why you bought and held a winner,
  or why you bought a big loser, but by keeping yourself honest you can learn from
  each investment over time. And after all, there’s no better investment than your
  own abilities.\n\n*The Author of this piece, Claude Walker, as at 9am on February
