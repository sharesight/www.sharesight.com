:title: Top 20 ASX trades by Sharesight users – September 2021
:url_slug: top-20-asx-trades-sharesight-september-2021
:content: "Welcome to the September 2021 edition of Sharesight’s monthly ASX trading
  snapshot, where we look at the top 20 trades Sharesight users made on the ASX during
  the month. \n\nIn this snapshot, buy trades were led by the Vanguard Australian
  Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS), closely followed by Fortescue Metals (ASX: FMG), which
  saw its share price strongly decline throughout September due to a sudden fall in
  iron ore prices. Sell trades were also led by Fortescue Metals, followed by BHP
  (ASX: BHP), which had a busy month planning to buy and sell off various assets.
  Overall, this month’s top trades were dominated by ETFs, with the remaining trades
  heavily weighted towards mining stocks. \n\n## Top 20 ASX trades September 2021\n\n![Top20
