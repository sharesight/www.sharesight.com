:title: What ASX moving to blockchain SHOULD mean for investors
:content: "###### NOTE: A version of this article first appeared in [Investor Daily](https://www.investordaily.com.au/analysis/42440-what-a-blockchain-powered-asx-should-mean).\n\nThe
  ASX announced it will be replacing its settlement system, known as CHESS, with a
  “[blockchain-inspired technology](http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/asx%20to%20upgrade%20to%20blythe%20master's%20blockchain-inspired%20digital%20asset%20holdings%20technology-20171206-h00avz).”
  Those of us investment nerds with an interest in financial plumbing have been keeping
  a close eye on this for years.\n\nI think this is a smart business move aimed at
  reducing operating costs and hopefully a step towards more efficient markets. In
  fact, [CHESS](/blog/what-is-chess/) was one of the world’s first electronic settlement
  systems, and the ASX has long been recognised as a leader in technology. I recall
  hearing about the ASX in my days at the Chicago Board of Trade (now owned by CME
  Group), another leader in market tech (bitcoin futures anyone?). \n\nI’ve seen this
  referred to as a “fintech revolution.” The reality is less exciting, but there is
  a chance for investors to benefit.\n\n![Featured-Doug-Morris-Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2bUTLDyCVu4MYio2I4eOO/e2a7068bd22a8b25bc33f856217f1b4a/Featured-Doug-Morris-Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\nThe
  ASX is basically transitioning CHESS to a new database run by a company in which
  they own a $40M stake. There is no open consensus approach (needed for a truly distributed
  solution), and access to CHESS data will remain private.\n\nThe ASX is a conservative
  outfit (rightly so) tasked with maintaining the stock market in the interest of
  the Australian economy - a big job! Their approach to this transition makes sense
  in that context. Not to mention, they’re a for-profit enterprise. My guess is the
  efficiencies gained will be sold as “market speed” and “price discovery” features
  to institutional trading houses and companies looking to list.\n\nThe ASX does,
  however, have an opportunity in front of them, one that would create better outcomes
  for millions of investors.\n\nIf the new CHESS system is truly what it’s cracked
  up to be, “[an immutable, synchronised record that creates a provable, single version
  of the truth](http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/asx%20to%20upgrade%20to%20blythe%20master's%20blockchain-inspired%20digital%20asset%20holdings%20technology-20171206-h00avz)”
  then fair access should be granted to all parties. That includes everyone from market
  makers to fintechs to individual investors wanting access to data that belongs to
  them.\n\nIndeed, Treasurer Scott Morrison agrees, [saying](http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media-release/128-2017/)
  “we support the ASX's commitment to designing a system that does not raise barriers
  to access for non-affiliated market operators and clearing and settlement facilities.”\n\nHistorically,
  access to CHESS data was only granted to those with a seat at the big table: prime
  brokers, banks, and financial institutions. Even though CHESS was designed to [lower
  costs for investors](http://www.asx.com.au/documents/research/chess_brochure.pdf),
  not everyone can gain access and they’re forced to rely on traditional, fee-layering
  gatekeepers. Our repeated attempts at Sharesight to access CHESS data have gone
  nowhere.\n\nIt ought to be easy for the ASX to create a permissioning system to
  allow for secure access to CHESS data on an individualised basis. No modern record-keeping
  system on the planet would be complete without one. If you’ve ever logged into something
  using your Google or Facebook account, then you’ve benefited from this type of technology.\n\nEveryone
  from technology companies, to upstart brokers, mobile apps, lenders, to traditional
  advice professionals would benefit from equal access to CHESS because they could
  in turn could provide more accurate and efficient services to their clients.\n\nThis
  would be a boon for investors because they’d enjoy more products and services, and
  ultimately lower costs.\n\nThe ASX, for its part, would benefit as well. First,
  they could charge for access to CHESS. This is no different than a software company
  licensing access to its API. Second, this would encourage more trading, and more
  capital would enter the market.\n\nWhile perhaps not a revolutionary moment, the
  ASX does have a golden opportunity to follow through on a fintech promise. Here’s
  hoping they do the right thing for Australian investors.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n-
