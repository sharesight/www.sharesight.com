:title: How zero-commission brokers have changed investing
:url_slug: brokers-with-zero-commission-trading-have-changed-investing
:content: "In just a matter of days, six of the largest brokers in the United States
  - [Interactive Brokers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-interactive-brokers/),
  TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity and Ally Invest - all announced
  they were abolishing commissions when trading stocks, ETFs and (some) options online.
  This rush from brokers to cut trading fees to zero represents a seismic shift in
  the industry, and presents a number of ramifications for both brokers and investors
  alike.\n\n## The cost of commission-free trading\n\nMany analysts say the price
  war really [began in 2013](https://snacks.robinhood.com/newsletters/3nFFPd0MfjBs5AqG8088gu/articles/5YfrqB1klOSuz0H52tu48Z/),
  when Robinhood, a Silicon Valley backed tech company, entered the American market
  with a business model built to offer zero-commission trading to investors. \n\nUnlike
  [Robinhood](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-robinhood-trades-into-sharesight/),
  the brokerage giants that have all rushed to offer zero-commission trading were
  all reliant to varying degrees on that fee revenue to support their businesses,
  with estimates on the hit to revenues for some brokers as high as 28%:\n\n<table>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <th>Broker</th>\n    <th>Impact on revenue</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>TD
  Ameritrade</td>\n    <td>28%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Charles Schwab</td>\n
  \   <td>8%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>E-Trade</td>\n    <td>17%</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<small>[Source:
  Bank of America CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/02/the-end-of-commissions-for-stock-trading-is-near-as-td-ameritrade-cuts-to-zero-matching-schwab.html)</small>\n\n##
  Zero-commission stock trading? What's the catch?\n\nBrokers still need to make money
  even if they aren’t charging commissions. Schwab for example [is the least exposed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/battle-for-client-assets-heats-up-as-brokers-cut-fees-to-zero.html)
  to the impact on revenues from adopting zero-commission trading, with a range of
  diversified alternate revenue sources, including:\n\n* Interest income from idle
  cash in brokerage cash accounts\n\n* Forex income\n\n* Wealth advice\n\n* Asset
  Management Fees\n\n* Fees on [lending securities to hedge funds](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-small-investors-lend-shares-to-hard-pressed-short-sellers)
  and short sellers \n\n## How have the markets reacted so far?\n\nAll of the listed
  American brokers to recently announce zero-commission trades have taken a beating
  on stock markets, with investors uncertain how this ‘race to the bottom’ on fee-free
  trading will hit future revenues. \n\nBelow is the performance of four of these
  brokerage stocks in 2019 in Sharesight: \n\n![Stock Brokers Performance 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7Jqgv8LeU9PUbQrSrBIRHf/0b14ff57d2d0daee2d989281f6663608/Stock_Brokers_Performance_2019.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Will other markets adopt zero-commission trades?\n\nThe short answer is, yes - competition
  from new online brokers has been increasing in countries worldwide. But in markets
  where the majority of Sharesight's users reside, there still tends to be a few dominant
  brokers with high market shares that are not yet under significant pressure from
  newer rivals to cut trading fees.\n\n**Australia:** Commsec has 53% market share
  ([Source: Investment trends](https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/commsec-profits-fall-20-8-per-cent-amid-market-turbulence-20190930-p52w6z.html)
  via SMH)\n\n**Canada:** TD Waterhouse has 45% market share ([Source: SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1085095/000095012300000595/0000950123-00-000595-d1.html))\n\n**UK:**
  Hargreaves Lansdown has a market share of 40.5% (Source: PlatforumUK D2C Market
  Update July 2019; data as at 31 March 2019 as quoted in their annual report for
  2019)\n\nMore than the competition among brokers, it's the competition between stock
  exchanges that's driving the adoption of zero-commission trading. The US has 13
  different stock exchanges on which orders can be executed. These exchanges compete
  for investors' order flows, providing opportunities for market making companies
  and high frequency traders. Brokers sell their order flows and make it available
  - generating payment for order flows as a viable revenue generating opportunity
  for brokers. This is also how Robinhood makes money.\n\nIn other markets, including
  Australia (ASX), New Zealand (NZX), Singapore (SGX) and Hong Kong (HKSE), there
  exist dominant local exchanges with little direct competition so there's no competitive
  pressure for these exchanges to compete on price for order flows. In Europe, payment
  for order flow is [restricted by regulators](https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/pfof-off-limits/).\n\n##
  Impact of zero-commission trades on investors\n\nFor a long term investor, zero-commission
  trades provide an opportunity to reduce the transactional costs of investing that
  eat away at returns. The other benefit we see is that investors can make smaller
  and more frequent trades as part of a [dollar cost averaging strategy](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/)
  without the transaction cost penalty.\n\nHowever, there is a risk that zero-commission
  trades will entice some investors to trade more frequently on short-term trends
  that carry additional risks. Those with a long term investment strategy will need
  discipline to avoid the temptation to trade in and out of holdings and stay the
  course to create long term wealth.\n\n## Track your trades with Sharesight\n\nWhether
