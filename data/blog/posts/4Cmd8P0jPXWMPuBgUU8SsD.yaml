  ## Why financial advisors are going off-platform

  According to [Platforum research](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/opinion/why-advisers-change-platform/), the key reason why financial advisors are looking to transfer away from WRAP platforms is cost; costs you will need to pass through to your client in an increasingly competitive space. Alongside this were decreased service levels and a lack of investment choices.

  This is where Sharesight Pro comes in. With lower costs and an investment agnostic platform, Sharesight Pro makes it easy for your clients to track investments directly in shares, managed funds and ETFs executed through a broker or provider of their choice. This allows you to deepen your client relationship by passing on lower costs and increasing the amount of time dedicated to providing advice.

  ## The high cost of WRAP platforms vs Sharesight Pro

  To illustrate the cost savings of moving to Sharesight Pro, let’s break down the cost of administration and account keeping fees on a $1,500,000 portfolio for three Australian WRAP platforms vs Sharesight Pro.

  |      |Platform 1     |Platform 2     |Platform 3     |Sharesight Pro     |
  | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
  |Costs on a $1,500,000 portfolio | 0 to $250,000 = 0.48% P.A $250,001 - $500,000 = 0.38% P.A $500,001 - $1,000,000 = 0.22% P.A $1,000,001 - $1,500,00 = 0.11% P.A Account Keeping Fee $180 P.A |0 to $250,000 = 0.35% P.A $250,001 - $500,000 = 0.25% P.A $500,001 - $1,000,000 = 0.15% $1,000,001 - $1,500,000 = 0.05% P.A|$0 to $250,000 = 0.37% P.A $250,001 - $500,000 = 0.30% P.A $500,001 - $1,000,000 = 0.20% P.A $1,000,001 - $1,500,001 = 0% |Sharesight Pro = $144 P.A** + Xero cashbook = $188 P.A (for transaction reconciliation purposes)|
  |Total (est) annual cost*|$3,980|$2,500|$2,675|$332|

  <small>* 1) These fees were sourced from the most recent PDS available for the platforms we reviewed when writing this article. Please refer to the PDS of your platform(s) for information specific to your scenario. 2) The calculation only includes Administration & Account Keeping Fees. The calculation excludes any international security fees, expense recovery, compliance, cash account fees, ICRS/MERS, brokerage, or any additional fees which may be applicable. 3) Please consider any insurance within your WRAP provider before changing. 4) Sharesight Pro prices in AUD excluding GST.</small>

  As you can see, these costs add up over time, and the cost savings, when reinvested over the life of your client relationship will have significant impacts on their returns.
