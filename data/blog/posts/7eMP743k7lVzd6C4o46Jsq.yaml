:title: The importance of asset allocation tracking for SMSFs
:content: "###### This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute
  a product recommendation, taxation or financial advice and should not be relied
  upon as such. Please check with your advisor or accountant before using Sharesight
  or any other tool for your SMSF, to ensure you meet the ATO’s [compliance obligations](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/SMSF-auditors/Auditing-an-SMSF/Compliance-audit/)\n\nTracking
  your asset allocation is a crucial part of maintaining a self-managed super fund
  \ – and one that is all too often put off by trustees. The ATO requires self-managed
  super funds (SMSFs) to [document their asset allocation](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/investing/your-investment-strategy/#Whatdoesgivingeffecttomyinvestmentstrate)
  and how this aligns with their investment strategy, reviewing this at least once
  per year. Ideally however, the ATO recommends that SMSF trustees review their strategy
  and asset allocation on a more frequent basis, especially in times when there is
  a market correction, a new member joins or departs the fund, or a member starts
  receiving a pension. \n\nWhile this can seem like a time-consuming process, there
  are tools available that take the time and effort out of manually tracking your
  asset allocation and investment strategy. This article will discuss recent data
  on how SMSFs are allocating their assets, and how trustees can use Sharesight’s
  portfolio tracker to automatically track their assets and get information at a glance
  about the return on their investments. To learn more, keep reading. \n\n![image

  How SMSFs allocated their assets in 2020\n\nThe year of 2020 saw a major market
  correction, causing some SMSF trustees to rethink their asset allocation and investment
  strategy. Diversification remained an important investment strategy, however, and
  is recommended by the ATO to avoid [concentration risk](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/investing/your-investment-strategy/#Whatdoeshavingregardtodiversificationmea)
  no matter what the market conditions are. \n\nBased on data from investors using
  Sharesight to track their SMSF, more than 80% of SMSF assets were concentrated in
  individual stocks, while the rest were primarily concentrated in ETFs and trusts.
  The majority of these assets were in the ASX, with only 15% in international markets.\n\nSharesight
  data also shows that the domestic stocks held by SMSFs in 2020 were largely companies
  known for sizeable dividends and good long-term performance. Meanwhile, the top
  international stocks were primarily tech-based companies concentrated on the Nasdaq.
  \n\nSMSFs continued to prioritise diversity in their asset allocation, with a leaning
  towards blue-chip companies that had proven returns over the economic cycle and
  were expected to be able to weather challenging market conditions. \n\n## How Sharesight
  helps investors track their assets\n\nTracking the asset allocation in your SMSF
  is an important part of ensuring you are adhering to your elected investment strategy.
  Sharesight’s portfolio tracker simplifies asset tracking for SMSF trustees by allowing
  investors to see all of their holdings in one place and track their asset allocation
  and investment strategy throughout the year with a range of powerful reports. \n\nSharesight’s
  [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  for example, gives investors a detailed breakdown of the asset allocation in their
  investment portfolio, including the ability to create Custom Groups. Custom Groups
  is a key feature for SMSF trustees when used with the Diversity Report, as it allows
  you to assess how your portfolio is tracking against self defined asset allocation
  categories at a given point in time. \n\nFor example, if you have an asset allocation
  target that dedicates 50% to domestic stocks, 20% to international stocks, 15% to
  property and 5% each to alternative investments, cash and domestic bonds, you may
  find it useful to group your investments under custom tags like below:\n\n![image
  1 assets](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5nMC1mHdLqO8PJyte9NFH8/d1417ee4264292cf3106fd4c61badb0a/image_1_assets.png?w=950)\n\nHaving
  established the custom groups of your choice, you can then run the Diversity Report
  to see how you are tracking against your asset allocation target. This will give
  you the information you need to adjust your assets, selling off any assets that
  are over-exposed or investing in assets that are under-represented in your portfolio.
  \n\nAs you can see in the screenshot of the Diversity Report, compared to the target
  weightings above, this portfolio is tracking significantly underweight in domestic
  stocks (19.88% vs a target of 50%) and is overweight in domestic bonds (15% vs a
  target of 5%).\n\n![image 2 assets](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1X31f2qqnlUbSIGwffeo1S/aa3b0320615543d43feee122efe000ae/image_2_assets.png?w=950)\n\nYou
  can also dive deeper into the performance of your SMSF asset allocation strategy
  using  Sharesight’s [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/),
  which shows you the contribution of each asset class to the overall performance
  of your portfolio, as seen in the example below. This is evaluated in terms of capital
  gains, dividends and currency gains, all of which are automatically tracked in your
  Sharesight portfolio. \n\n![image 3 assets](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3QgT17DzgxrdLRWUye0UyP/ad7c94fc9d936dc0dd675f13599162da/image_3_assets.png?w=950)\n\nImportantly,
  Sharesight makes it easy to track all of your holdings in one place. Not only can
  users track all of their SMSF holdings in one portfolio, but the [Consolidated View](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/)
  feature also allows you to track the performance of your investments across all
  of your portfolios at once. Displayed in the screenshot below, this is a useful
  feature if you have investments outside of your SMSF.\n\n![image 4 assets](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/40klTKlUhnyQX06Iipe7BA/dbc10ef4cf515fee62f73d23feb4cf53/image_4_assets.png?w=950)\n\n##
