:title: How to track exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
:url_slug: how-to-track-exchange-traded-funds-etfs
:content: "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are an increasingly popular type of investment
  fund that can be bought and sold directly on stock exchanges. Among Sharesight users,
  the share of ETFs within investor portfolios has grown steadily [over the last decade
  from <1% to almost 10%](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/exchange-traded-fund-etf-growth-in-investment-portfolios/)
  as investors increasingly switch from managed funds (managed trusts) to ETFs. Like
  all investments, it’s critical to track the performance of ETFs in your portfolio.

  ETF history \n\nThere is some contention over which ETF commands the title as [\"the
  first ETF\"](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/12/brief-history-exchange-traded-funds.asp).
  However, the concept of using a listed investment trust structure as a vehicle to
  invest in a broad range of underlying stocks gained traction in the early 1990s,
  with the launch of the [S&P 500 Trust ETF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spiders.asp)
  “SPDR” (NYSE: SPY) on January 22 of 1993.\n\nInitially, ETFs followed in the footsteps
  of the SPDR ETF and allowed investors to gain exposure to a fund that sought to
  replicate (minus fees) the performance of a ‘passive’ market index like the S&P
  500. Over time fund managers added \"smart-beta\" (seeking to replicate an ‘alternative’
  index) and “active” (actively managed by a fund manager with a strategy aiming to
  beat the market) ETFs to their offerings, further blurring the lines between managed
  funds and their exchange-traded fund cousins.\n\nRead our guide on [what to look
  for when buying ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-to-look-for-when-buying-etfs/)
  if you’re considering investing in exchange traded funds.\n\n## Tracking ETF performance\n\nETFs
  have an open ended structure, which means that when investors seek to purchase additional
  units of the fund, the fund manager (or issuer) can issue additional units to the
  exchange. This means that unlike [listed investment companies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/etfs-versus-lics-what-you-need-to-know/)
  that can trade significantly above or below their [Net Asset Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_asset_value),
  ETFs trade at a unit price close to the value of the underlying assets each unit
  holds. And unlike managed funds, which can have opaque price discovery, tracking
  the performance of ETFs is much like any other stock, because ETFs are listed (and
  traded) on stock exchanges.\n\n### ETF tax considerations\n\nTracking the performance
  of your ETF investments is only one part of the puzzle; managing the tax implications
  is the other. ETFs are a unitised trust structure that hold a number of underlying
  assets that each have their own tax implications on distributions earned by the
  ETF. The tax implications will vary by region; for example in the USA distributions
  earned by the ETF are typically [treated as ‘ordinary dividends’](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-taxes-introduction.asp)
  and taxed accordingly, whereas in Australia most ETFs use the [Attribution Managed
  Investment Trust (AMIT) structure](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  and are a [tax nightmare.](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  ETFs also create complexity for UK investors, as depending whether the ETF has reporting
  status or not, or whether it was purchased through an ISA or SIPP, this can have
  significant implications on [how it is taxed](https://www.justetf.com/en/news/passive-investing/how-etfs-are-taxed-in-the-uk.html).\n\nHere
  are all the ways [Sharesight makes ETF tax calculations easy.](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/)\n\n##
  How to track ETFs in Sharesight\n\nIt’s easy to track the price and performance
  of your ETF investments, with Sharesight’s support for [over 40 global stock exchanges](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/).
  Here’s how to add an ETF to your Sharesight portfolio(s):\n\n1. Sign up for a [FREE
  Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup).\n\n2. You can add
  an ETF to your portfolio(s) by manually adding a trade and searching for the ETF’s
  name in the relevant market (eg. NYSE: SPY). You can also use the [Sharesight File
  Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  to bulk import trades to your portfolio.\n\n3. Sharesight converts the prices and
  valuations of your holdings from their listed market to your portfolio’s base currency.
  It also automatically calculates any currency fluctuations on a daily basis and
  backfills past dividends and distributions (and continues to add new ones as they
  are announced).\n\n![Sharesight ETF tracking](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4tfwJRuY8Yr05qPG0lLdWI/18813df90de169a44cf5d68de04def7a/Sharesight_ETF_tracking.jpg?w=950)\n\n<small>
  With Sharesight, investors can clearly see the impact of capital gains, dividends
  and foreign currency fluctuations on the performance of their ETFs. </small>\n\n##
  ETF benchmarking with Sharesight\n\nExchange traded funds make for excellent ‘index
  tracking’ (such as the S&P 500) benchmarks because they take into account all the
  inner workings of a real portfolio, including fees, dividends and any [franking
  credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-franked-dividend/) that may apply.
  Sharesight allows investors to benchmark against ETFs as well as [any managed fund,
  trust or stock tracked by Sharesight.](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)\n\n![Tracking
