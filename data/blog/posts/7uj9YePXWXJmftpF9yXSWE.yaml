:content: "Investing in share markets may be easier than ever before but evaluating
  which shares to buy still takes some skill. Some investors are happy taking stock
  tips from friends, some follow the recommendations of professional money managers
  and still others use ratings from research providers like [Morningstar](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/morningstar/).
  Whatever the methodology, stock analysis and company research will inevitably throw
  up some terms and concepts that investors should be familiar with. \n\n![Evaluate

  What to consider when choosing to invest in shares\n\nIt is important to remember
  that selecting shares should be done as part of a broad strategy, often to build
  a diverse portfolio that aims to achieve specific investment goals. Investors should
  begin this journey by assessing their [appetite for risk](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/does-your-investment-portfolio-match-your-appetite-for-risk/)
  as this will determine the sort of companies, sectors and countries they invest
  in. It is also worth considering whether the investor aims to earn a regular [income
  from dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-monthly-dividend-income-from-your-investments/),
  chasing capital growth over the long term or a combination of the two. \n\nBuying
  shares in a company means becoming a part owner, so investors should take the time
  to research the business and [understand the sector it operates in](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tips-for-becoming-a-successful-share-market-investor-tip-5/).
  This includes both assessing the company’s management and track record and considering
  macroeconomic factors that could affect the business, like [exchange rates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/intraday-foreign-exchange-rates-now-on-sharesight/),
  disruption / competition and changes to government legislation.\n\n## Common metrics
  to evaluate shares\n\n[Valuation ratios](https://finbox.com/blog/top-12-valuation-ratios-investors/)
  are a common metric and are crucial to determining a company’s worth, with several
  in widespread use. These can be useful tools in helping investors assess the value
  of a company, compare different companies and sectors or evaluate investment potential
  on a specific metric. Four common terms and associated ratios are:\n\n### Earnings
  per share\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is a company's net profit divided by the number
  of common shares it has outstanding. It is considered one of the [most important
  methods of share price analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) as
  EPS indicates a company's profitability. The higher a company's EPS, the more profitable
  it is considered and companies that have a track record of growing their EPS each
  year are highly regarded. It is a useful exercise for investors to ascertain whether
  the EPS of a company they are considering investing in has been growing or falling
  and then try to work out the reason for this. EPS not only offers a quick insight
  into a company’s earnings growth from one year to the next but also gives a clear
  picture of earnings relative to dividends, as these are also expressed on a per
  share basis.\n\n### Price-to-earnings ratio\n\n[Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-interpret-the-pe-ratio/)
  looks at the relationship between a company's stock price and its earnings, giving
  investors a good idea of what the market is willing to pay for the company's potential
  earnings. The ratio is determined by dividing the company's current share price
  by its earnings per share. A high P/E number generally suggests investors see high
  growth potential whereas a low ratio suggests the opposite. However, earnings can
  be hard to predict as past earnings don't guarantee future earnings and analysts'
  expectations can miss the mark. Experts mainly use P/E ratios to [compare companies
  within the same industry or sector](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/use-pe-ratio-and-peg-to-tell-stocks-future/)
  and it is not considered a reliable standalone metric.\n\n### Net Tangible Assets\n\nNet
  tangible assets can be a useful metric for evaluating a company’s future profitability,
  especially in capital intensive industries. To arrive at this number, one takes
  the total assets of a company – property, plant, and equipment – and subtract total
  liabilities –goodwill, patents and trademarks. Tangible is included in the definition
  of the asset to indicate that not every asset is valued equally at all times. To
  calculate a company's [net tangible asset per share of common stock](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062515/how-are-net-tangible-assets-calculated.asp),
  the investor divides the net tangible assets figure by the number of shares of common
  stock outstanding. This metric allows investors to focus on a company's physical
  assets in isolation.\n\n### Price-to-book ratio\n\nPrice-to-book ratio (P/B) gives
  an indicator of how fairly priced – cheap or expensive – a share is at any given
  time. It is calculated by taking the current price per share and dividing by the
  book value per share. The book value of a company is a more conservative view of
  its value, as it simply looks at the difference between the balance sheet assets
  and balance sheet liabilities. This gives a good indication of what investors are
  willing to pay for each dollar of a company's net value. The P/B ratio is of particular
  interest to value investors who like to invest in companies with a [market value
  less than its book value](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010915/what-considered-good-price-book-ratio.asp)
  with the expectation that the market perception will turn out to be wrong.\n\n##
  Common investment frameworks\n\nThere are many methods for investors to consider
  when taking a view on a sector or analysing a specific company. These might be to
  consider the threat of competitors or new entrants, especially in industries vulnerable
  to disruption; the bargaining power of buyers or suppliers; and whether a product
  or service is curtailed or enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Other frameworks include
  the three Cs (Company, Competitors, Customers); the four Ps (Product, Price, Promotion,
  Placement); and SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).\n\nIt
  is also useful to keep asking and answering a set of generic questions as part of
  the analysis. Including:\n\n* How does the company make money? \n\n* Does this company
  have a competitive advantage? \n\n* How good is the management team? \n\n* What
  could go wrong?\n\n## Company reports, news and broker research\n\nCompanies issue
  annual reports and financial statements detailing their activities throughout the
  year and these are a good place to start sourcing information. By reviewing a company’s
  balance sheet, its sources of income and how it handles its cash, revenues and expenses,
  one can form a view of how it is being managed and run. This also allows for comparison
  with other companies in the same industry, sector or region.\n\nAnd while there
  are endless metrics and ratios investors can use to assess a company’s general financial
  health and calculate its intrinsic value, looking at revenue or income from a single
  year or the management team’s most recent decisions paints an incomplete picture.
  Broker reports can help with historical data, offer a well-informed narrative about
  the company and add some context to its decision-making. This detail can offer investors
  insight into the company’s resilience, reactions to challenges and ability to improve
  its performance and deliver shareholder value over time.\n\nFinally, it’s important
  to keep up with current market events and reassess investments regularly. Reading
  financial news media, and listening to [investment podcasts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/top-50-finance-and-investing-podcasts/)
  are all invaluable in this process.\n\n## Evaluate your stocks with Sharesight\n\nThousands
