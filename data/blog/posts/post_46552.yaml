  Once your historical trading or opening balance data is loaded into [Sharesight](/), the next step is [running powerful performance and tax reports](https://help.sharesight.com/reports/). And while most people are happy to simply view these reports within the Sharesight app, others also like to download the spreadsheet or PDF reports and archive or print them out. This is especially the case for our Pro clients, who appreciate being able to [customise the reports](https://help.sharesight.com/applying-your-logo-to-reports/) with their company brand and contact information.

  Up until now, Sharesight’s spreadsheet reports could only be opened in Microsoft Excel - an issue for individual investors who didn’t own Microsoft Excel (and didn’t want to shell-out the $100 or so to buy it). **The good news for these clients is that our developers have recently switched to the [OpenXML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) (XLSX) format. This file extension can be opened on multiple spreadsheet applications, including Microsoft Excel and many free platforms including [Apple Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/), [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org), and [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org).**
