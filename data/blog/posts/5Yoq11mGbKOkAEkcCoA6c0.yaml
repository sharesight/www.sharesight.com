  ### How to track Madrid, Milan, Bombay & India stock markets

  1. Sign-up for a [Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup) account.
  2. [Add your holdings](https://help.sharesight.com/getting-started-with-sharesight/) to your portfolio(s).
  3. Sharesight converts the prices and valuations of your holdings from their listed market to your portfolio’s base currency. It also automatically calculates any currency fluctuations on a daily basis and backfills past dividends (and continues to add new ones as they are announced).
