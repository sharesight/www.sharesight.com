:title: How to add Sharesight to your smartphone or tablet home screen
:content: |-
  While [Sharesight](/) offers handy [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/sharesight-reader/id1147841214?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sharesight.reader&hl=en) mobile apps, there are times when you may want to access the full Sharesight experience from your mobile device. For example, here are a few things you can only do on Sharesight.com that you can’t do on the mobile app:

  - [Add a buy/sell trade](https://help.sharesight.com/adding-buy-and-sell-trades-or-adjustments-manually/)
  - [Confirm a dividend](https://help.sharesight.com/automatically-generated-dividends-and-adjustments/)
  - [Benchmark your portfolio](/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)

  While you can always navigate to [sharesight.com](/) from your device’s browser, creating a Sharesight shortcut on your mobile device’s home screen means you won’t have to type out the full URL each time. This lets you quickly access Sharesight when you need it.

  ## Here’s how to add Sharesight to the home screen on any smartphone or tablet

  ### iPhone, iPad, & iPod Touch

  ###### Note: If you use other a browser other than the default Safari browser (for example, Chrome iOS), you’ll need to use Safari to add Sharesight to your home screen because Apple limits other browsers from saving shortcuts to the home screen.

  **Follow these steps to add Sharesight to your iOS home screen:**

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1 -- From your Apple iOS device, launch the Safari browser.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4iyvPQhsxGqICoOgGIaqws/464df1f42da4ed547bc9ba1e4743593a/add-sharesight-to-apple-ios_1.png" alt="Sharesight iOS"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>2 -- Navigate to <a href="https://portfolio.sharesight.com/login">portfolio.sharesight.com/login</a>, enter your login credentials (or <a href="/blog/login-to-sharesight-with-google/">sign in with Google</a>) and click “Log in”.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4n4iM41jY4om6iywYMWSeA/e7412cd3470adb13504f2ebacefc703c/add-sharesight-to-apple-ios_2.png" alt="Sharesight mobile login"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>3 -- Once logged in, tap the “share” icon on the browser’s toolbar (it’s a rectangle with an arrow pointing upward). It’s on the bar at the top of the screen on an iPad, and on the bar at the bottom of the screen on an iPhone or iPod Touch.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/58bPxzW2rCOmAWcaKs8wmO/bdb657c5e0b8497451cbf9547dea34df/add-sharesight-to-apple-ios_3.png" alt="Sharesight mobile portfolio tracker"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>4 -- Tap the “Add to Home Screen” icon in the share menu.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1Lc8wajatmkY6yQ4u0KC2m/1f2285bdd8da4411652d497de3ff4097/add-sharesight-to-apple-ios_4.png" alt="iOS share tracker"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>5 -- Click "Add".</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6JPrSiNDtSKGeMGQ8wYm8/bd86d69cf8f6839183751dc18323b63d/add-sharesight-to-apple-ios_5.png" alt="Add Sharesight to home screen"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>6 -- You should now see the Sharesight icon on your home screen. The icon can be dragged around and placed anywhere, including in app folders — just like a normal app icon. (To create app folders on iOS, touch-and-drag an app’s icon onto another app’s icon and hold it there for a moment.)<br><br>
      When you tap the Sharesight icon, it will load Sharesight in a normal tab inside the Safari browser app.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/67NaI8ne1ye6UYSUCwucEM/53600cd670bbfff311930b718bae8514/add-sharesight-to-apple-ios_6.png" alt="Sharesight on iOS"></td>
    </tr>
   </table>

  ### Android

  **Follow these steps to add Sharesight to your Android home screen:**

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1 -- From your Android device, launch the Chrome browser.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1GlvrZoAgUMMeAkkoQqogo/6feda8d3c4e3739a93f6dccbab2a2fce/add-sharesight-to-android_1.png" alt="Android Chrome Sharesight"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>2 -- Navigate to <a href="https://portfolio.sharesight.com/login">portfolio.sharesight.com/login</a>, enter your login credentials (or <a href="/blog/login-to-sharesight-with-google/">sign in with Google</a>) and click “Log in”.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Gpb87bkHYomw2Kia26o6/07fa03f7b75a2feefd6466b524a5176a/add-sharesight-to-android_2.png" alt="Sharesight android portfolio"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>3 -- Tap the menu button and tap “Add to homescreen”.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/38yZqtYOQwCMUSCAMEmImK/7b4b735ab563e8ebe633c190f85ba8e3/add-sharesight-to-android_3.png" alt="Sharesight android add to home screen"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>4 -- Click "Add".</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7Hz4VInjhK0esYSG8cmq2A/b06c41320a2b9fe324a645d5ce86a893/add-sharesight-to-android_4.png" alt="Android Sharesight"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>5 -- You should now see the Sharesight icon on your home screen. You can drag it around and put it wherever you like.<br><br>
      When you tap the icon, Chrome for Android loads the website as a “web app”, so it will get its own entry in the app switcher and won’t have any browser interface getting in the way.</td>
      <td><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/16I511lgoCW0mqEsa2M4iY/c63d0a851b4cfa70931c6e7d6b367184/add-sharesight-to-android_5.png" alt="Sharesight Mobile Android"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  ### Notes

  - This feature should work for other smartphones, tablets and browsers. Just open the browser and look for an option called “add to home screen” or “pin to home screen.”
  - To remove a website shortcut from your device’s home screen, just long-press the icon and remove it like you would any other app icon.
