  Last week we teamed up with [Real Estate Investar](https://www.realestateinvestar.com.au/ME2/Default.asp) to conduct a webinar to our joint client bases. Real Estate Investar is a lot like [Sharesight](/), but for investment properties. And like Sharesight, they're a [Xero award winner](http://blog.realestateinvestar.com.au/real-estate-investar-wins-xero-emerging-add-on-partner-of-the-year-award).

  Clients often ask if Sharesight offers a way to track property. While we do offer an unlisted investment feature, we'd argue that if property makes up a meaningful portion of your portfolio - then why not track it properly, with a purpose-built application?

  Real Estate Investar offers 2 versions of their product: one for existing property owners and one for those doing research to buy property. Their app is underpinned by [Xero Cashbook](/xero/), which means that all your property income and expenses are tracked properly and can be accessed by your accountant. If you missed the webinar, you can view it here: [On-Demand Webinar: Essential Tips For Successfully Managing Your Property And Share Portfolios](https://www.slideshare.net/RealEstateInvestar/successfully-managing-your-property-and-share-portfolio).
