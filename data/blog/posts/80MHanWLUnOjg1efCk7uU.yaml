:title: Track investments in Chinese Yuan with Sharesight
:content: "Sharesight users can easily track investments in the offshore Chinese Yuan
  (CNH) and onshore Yuan (CNY) currencies. This includes the ability to track trades,
  dividends and [cash investments](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/)
  in Yuan, along with access to [more than 60 other global currencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-investments-in-67-different-currencies-with-sharesight/)
  and [key Asian stock exchanges](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).

  What is the Chinese Yuan?\n\nThe [Chinese Yuan](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/article/special_report/2018/09/12/cnh-vs-cny-differences-between-the-two-yuan-.html)
  (or Renminbi) exists in two forms: CNY and CNH. The CNY is the currency used in
  the Chinese onshore mainland market, while the CNH is used in the offshore market,
  which includes traditional Yuan centres such as Hong Kong, Singapore, London and
  Luxembourg. \n\nGenerally, the CNH tends to be less controlled and more market-driven,
  and has a more diversified range of investment products, making it a popular choice
  for global investments. It is important to note that while the two currencies are
  similar, exchange rates can differ between the CNY and CNH; even when responding
  to the same economic event, the CNH tends to react more strongly as there are no
  trading barriers or central bank market operations, however it is also more impacted
  by global factors. \n\n## Track your investments in Yuan\n\nSharesight users can
  easily track their Chinese and international investments, with access to [more than
  170 global markets](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),
  including the Shenzhen (SHE), Hong Kong (HKG) and Singapore (SGX) exchanges. \n\nBy
  linking a[ cash account](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/)
  to their portfolio, Sharesight users can automatically track buy and sell trades,
  dividends and distributions paid in Yuan (CNH). This gives users the complete picture
  of their investments, including the value of cash on hand that is not fully invested.
  Users can easily create a cash account by clicking ‘Add Cash Account’ on the Portfolio
  Overview page.\n\n![image 1 Yuan](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7iGpz7rPEoJYMaiaF0EHFi/f6e631f5918f57126d266e2567d68cae/image_1_Yuan.png?w=950)\n\n<small>

  the performance of global investment portfolios is made simple with Sharesight’s
  support for [intraday foreign exchange rates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/intraday-foreign-exchange-rates-now-on-sharesight/),
  which are updated daily every 5 minutes (20 minutes delayed). Sharesight also automatically
  converts the prices and valuations of your holdings from their listed market to
  your portfolio’s base currency, continually tracking the impact of currency fluctuations
  on your investment performance. As seen in the screenshot below, this makes it possible
  to track foreign exchange rates, cash accounts and global stocks – all in one place.\n\n![image
