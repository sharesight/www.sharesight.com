:title: Announcing the Contribution Analysis Report
:content: "Today we released a new feature, the Contribution Analysis Report. This
  report is available for [Expert Plan](/pricing/) and [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) customers
  and is now available in the [Reports](https://help.sharesight.com/reports/) menu.\n\n##
  What the Contribution Analysis Report means for investors\n\nThe Contribution Analysis
  Report explains the drivers behind your portfolio’s performance, be they stock selection,
  [asset allocation](/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/), or exposure
  to certain countries, sectors, or industries. \n\nThis type of analysis is also
  referred to as *[performance attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_attribution)*
  and is important for investors because it provides an explanation of how your returns
  are derived and critically, where your portfolio tracks or diverges from the benchmark.
  As any experienced investor knows, significant outperformers and underperformers
  mask the real factors behind your historical performance.\n\n![Featured - Contribution

  packed a great deal of flexibility into the Contribution Analysis Report -- you
  can view contribution analysis at the individual stock level, or roll up to various
  categories -- including the [Custom Groups](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/) you’ve
  created. The report can be run across the entire history of your portfolio or a
  specific time period.\n\n## The Contribution Analysis Report in action\n\nHere’s
  an example of the Contribution Analysis Report using my portfolio over the past
  six months. In the first screenshot, I’ve chosen to view the individual holdings.
  It’s immediately clear which positions have contributed to (and detracted from)
  my total return, and by what degree.\n\n![Screenshot - Contribution Analysis Report

  (OFX) really stung me, but Amazon (AMZN) and Alumina (AWC) helped. I can also see
  that Xero (XRO) and my position in a global healthcare ETF (IXJ) weighed me down.\n\nBut
  was it Amazon the company, or the tech sector in general that gave my portfolio
  a lift? Should I rebalance my portfolio towards Aussie resources, or is there something
  about Alumina (or aluminium) that explains that particular gain?\n\nSwitching to
  the Industry Classification view provides the answer. The aluminium industry has
  done well, but the general metals/mining space has done better -- a fact not apparent
  on the individual holdings view. \n\nMore surprising is that my exposure to Financial
  Conglomerates (Berkshire Hathaway and Magellan Financial) has given my portfolio
  the biggest boost -- contributing almost 20% of my total return. Maybe it’s the
  global blue chips inside those holdings that are really providing alpha.\n\n![Screenshot

  I like to invest in companies I follow closely and in specific themes, and because
  companies don’t always fit into sector or industry classifications, I use Custom
  Groups to apply my own particular worldview. Doing so is constructive because it
  shows me that my macro ideas are generating positive returns on the whole. My “Core”
  investments are doing exactly as I’d hoped, but surprisingly my tech shares are
  contributing the least.\n\n![Screenshot - Contribution Analysis Report 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6pIgftnGvKogoIIQq8Gi60/3f4546e9369c087ee9a58214bb38fe9b/screenshot_contribution-analysis-report_3.png?w=950)\n\nWe
  hope you enjoy the Contribution Analysis Report -- as always we’d love to hear your
  feedback via our [Community Forum](https://community.sharesight.com).\n\n**UPDATE
