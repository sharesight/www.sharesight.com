:title: Improved stock market news in Sharesight
:content: |-
  Being an informed investor means having access to the latest news and insights that impact your investments. Sharesight’s news feed feature is just one way investors can access crucial information that might impact a stock’s price.

  After adding [The Motley Fool Singapore insights](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/get-the-motley-fool-singapore-insights-in-sharesight/) to the Sharesight news feed last month, we’ve released a new improvement that consolidates all the latest news from across our content partners into a single news feed for each stock, rather than potentially hiding news behind tabs for each news provider.

  ## Improved news feed layout

  For any stock listed with news available, you will now see a single news feed for that stock when viewing the holding in Sharesight, either through the share checker, or when viewing a particular holding. Clicking the links will take you to the news site to read more. Below we see the latest news for Telstra, which illustrates how we identify the source of each article in the news feed -- in this case, from [Firstlinks](/partners/firstlinks/), and [Livewire](/partners/livewire/):

  ## More stock news feeds coming to Sharesight

  Currently users will mostly see news on ASX and SGX listed stocks due to coverage provided by our [current news partners](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/research-providers/). We are however keen to work with other publishers to add their news feeds to Sharesight stocks across all the markets Sharesight covers.

  If you’re a potential content partner, reach out -- we’d love to hear from you.
