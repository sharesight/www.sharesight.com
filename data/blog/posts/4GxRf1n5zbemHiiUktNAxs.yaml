:title: What your broker tells you vs what they actually mean
:content: "Most Australian stock brokers, especially the online outfits run by the
  big banks, care about one thing: getting you to trade more. They’re not particularly
  interested in the \"[picks and shovels](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pick-and-shovel-play.as![What
  your broker tells you vs what they actually mean](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6BKeklypVgXGIJrZ8q7D7X/e6ae89305074648d4ffe2146b288b280/What_your_broker_tells_you_vs_what_they_actually_mean.jpg?w=950)p)\"
  aspect of investing, such as helping [Australian investors complete their tax returns](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-australian-investors-at-tax-time/).\n\nFortunately,
  that’s exactly what Sharesight was built to do.\n\nRight around this time of year
  I look forward to a bit of comic relief in my inbox. That is, the annual \"how broker
  X is making tax time easy\" email and marketing campaign.\n\nIf you define \"easy\"
  as downloading spreadsheets, sourcing three different registry websites for unit
  balances and dividends (god help you if you [reinvest dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)),
  and checking PDFs for distribution data, then you’re in luck. Tax time will be a
  piece of cake for you!\n\n## What your broker tells you vs what they actually mean\n\nThere
  are a number of common phrases in these broker emails, here’s what they *really*
  mean:\n\n\n| Broker Says   | Broker Means  |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| Be
  a Smart Investor at Tax Time   |Savvy investors use tax time to their advantage,
  especially if they’re sitting on capital losses. Unfortunately, we don’t provide
  you with tax reports and if we do send you something notional it will be for the
  trades you’ve made with us, and not anyone else. |\n| Update your Personal Details
  \    | We’ve posted you a bunch of stuff, hopefully you haven’t moved house. Would
  you like a home loan?     |\n| Download your Trades   | Incredibly, the only way
  to view your transaction history is by downloading raw data into Microsoft Excel
  and parsing the actual share trades from the other junk (like the fees we charge
  you).     |\n| Review your Trade Confirmation Emails  | We don’t make it easy to
  download all of these, much less a summary. Hopefully you’ve created an email filter
  so you find 12 months’ worth of trading history and then print each one for your
  accountant. Consider buying premium Adobe so you can collate PDF files.    |\n|
  Check your Dividends       | Even though Aussie investors love dividends because
  of our incredible franking policy, we have no insight into your dividends whatsoever.
  You need to create an account on the three different registry websites and download
  your dividend history. This will probably cost you $40 per registry if you need
  historical data.       |\n| Update your Tax File Number (TFN)   | The ATO is cracking
  down on the entire industry so it’s best you stay on top of your tax. Also, we’re
  now responsible for sharing capital gain and loss data with the tax office as well
  so it will pay to be organised!      |\n| Understand your Portfolio Performance
  \   | We’ll show you <font color=\"#008000\">green</font> numbers if you’ve made
  money and <font color=\"#ff0000\">red</font> numbers if you’ve lost money. If you
  see green, you probably owe some tax. We don’t provide information on investment
  duration, cost bases, or dividends. Also you can’t benchmark your portfolio against
  the market.   |\n\n\n## Sharesight *actually* makes it easy at tax time\n\n![Sharesight
  Hero - Laptop](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6ZeF8Kv5c8pcVgD5iogE4D/f19820a74d1e3ee3c55c30896e5eb8c7/sharesight_hero_laptop.png?w=950)\n\nUnlike
