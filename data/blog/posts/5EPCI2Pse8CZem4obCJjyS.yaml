  Once again the product team smashed it out of the park in June, delivering a veritable plethora of features and enhancements to ward off the winter blues.

  First up, the one you’ve all been waiting for... we now have [15 minute delayed pricing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/) available for NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX, BATS and LSE markets!

  Secondly we launched the long awaited revival of the [community forum](https://community.sharesight.com/). Jump on and join in the conversation with your fellow Sharesight fans.

  Thirdly we launched a new [email notifications page](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/notification_preferences) so that you can fine tune your email preferences just the way you like. If you’re a long time Sharesight user you may have made the tragic mistake of unsubscribing from everything, so hit the new preferences page to subscribe to all the good stuff that you’ve been missing out on. Our tester Sophie will have you know that architecting this feature was way more complicated than you think.

  Plenty more rolled off the production line too, read on for details.
