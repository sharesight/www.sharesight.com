:title: Questions to ask before investing in Spaceship
:url_slug: questions-to-ask-before-investing-in-spaceship
:content: "[Spaceship](https://www.spaceship.com.au/), a new super fund aimed at young
  investors and those seeking technology exposure is set to launch. I must fit their
  target demographic -- not a day goes by that I don’t see their ads on Facebook.\n\nThey’re
  attracting headlines -- positive and negative -- in the financial press.\n\nI support
  efforts to get younger people interested in investing. I’m also preferential to
  technology stocks. Combine that with Australia’s compulsory superannuation system
  and you’ve got the potential for something impactful (a close parallel to roboadvice).
  Motivated by a [recent headline](https://australianfintech.com.au/super-fund-spaceship-accused-of-high-risk-and-not-enough-returns/)
  accusing Spaceship of high risk and not high enough returns I wanted to see if I
  could rebuild it using [Sharesight](/).\n\nIn addition to revealing Spaceship’s
  performance, I want to know:\n\n1. **What’s in it?**\n2. **How much does it cost?**\n3.
  **What does this mean for their target audience?**\n\nAccording to their website,
  Spaceship will “invest in the future” via a “diversified portfolio with technology
  at its core.” They reveal a sample $100k portfolio, down to the value they allocate
  each stock. \n\n![featured - spaceship](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6MMtmnm9Ec2gsckeCqcGEY/06feda53294307ef9fdae95ce2925422/featured_spaceship.jpg?w=950)\n\nBefore
  I go further, Spaceship should be commended for revealing what’s actually in their
  portfolio -- most super funds don’t, which leaves investors in the dark.\n\nImportantly
  their site says the portfolio is a representation of the fund’s largest holdings
  as at 4 January 2017. I’m backdating the portfolio by one year (to 1 March 2016)
  and using only the information they disclose. \n\nTheir site shows 72 holdings in
  both “Tech” and “The Rest.” Tech receives $34,170 and The Rest $65,830, including
  $7k in cash and fixed interest. That’s roughly 34% tech, 66% non tech.\n\nThe 72
  investments they list only add up to $55,000. Does that mean $45k is invested somewhere
  else? I’m not sure, but let’s go with the information we do have.\n\nTo recreate
  in Sharesight, I bought each company on 1 March 2016 for the dollar amount they’ve
  stated. I work backwards from the closing price on that day, while factoring in
  the currency conversion. For ASX holdings, I round up or down to the nearest whole
  unit (US markets allow fractional holdings). I’ve chosen not to reinvest the dividends
  because their prospectus doesn’t specify.\n\nI didn’t add brokerage fees, but I
  will factor in their annual fee (ICR), which I assume includes brokerage and other
  costs.\n\nAll holdings are faithful to the securities they’ve listed. In the case
  of Tencent, however, I used the Hong Kong listed version as we don’t have data for
  the vehicle they use. The relative performance should be the same, but this introduced
  a small $28 loss on the foreign exchange.\n\nFor cash and fixed interest, I created
  two [custom investments](https://help.sharesight.com/unquoted-instruments/) with
  appropriate interest payments.\n\n## How has Spaceship performed?\n\nIncluding their
  1.6% p.a. fee, from 1 March 2016 to 14 March 2017, Spaceship delivered an 18% annualised
  return, or $10,563 on our initial investment of $55,000.\n\nFees are hard to grasp.
  Here’s an easy way to think about it: Spaceship kept about 10% of the money they
  made me.\n\nWhat they lost to currency headwinds they made up for in dividend income.
  However, they fell short of an ETF that tracks the ASX 200 (STW):\n\n![screenshot

  ASX 200 isn’t the best benchmark given so much of the portfolio is invested in overseas
  tech. Here’s how Spaceship stacks-up against some alternatives:\n\n| Investment
  | Return %<sup>1</sup>|\n| ---------- | ----------  |\n| Global Tech ETF (IXN)    |28%|\n|
  S&P 500 ETF (SPY)        |18%|\n| Spaceship                |18%|\n| Aussie Property
  ETF (VAP)|7%|\n| Snapchat (SNAP)          |-13%|\n\n<small><sup>1</sup>ETF performance
  is net of fees, from 1 March 2016 through 14 March 2017. Snapchat performance since
  IPO.</small>\n\n## How techy is Spaceship? \n\nA traditional sector breakdown shows
  tech exposure of 32% if you add up the relevant categories - in line with what Spaceship
  says (Sharesight also uses the [GICS industry classification](/blog/updated-industry-classification-data/)
  method that Spaceship mentions on their site):\n\n![screenshot - Spaceship super
  fund 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3mb2EAHO9OwoCSmysEQu0s/73f3e4d2a93a424d1cdd8717b0d51f1e/screenshot_spaceship-super-fund-2.png?w=950)\n\nBut
  what makes a tech stock a tech stock? What risk premium do we attach to tech in
  2017? Sector and industry classifications fall short of explaining how tech companies
  earn revenue. \n\nGoogle and Facebook aren’t risky alternatives to TV and radio.
  They represent the world’s advertising platform. Visa, Mastercard, and Equinix are
  not Finance companies. They’re tech companies sitting on mountains of data. Alibaba
  doesn’t belong in the same category as Woolworth’s (Retail Trade), nor does Accenture
  belong with Facebook (Technology Services).\n\nSo I’ve reclassified things using
  [custom groups](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/) in Sharesight:\n\n![screenshot
  - Spaceship super fund 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/SGkE94jxa8QiOcOkiuo0u/9f1efeda30fea7effb770d83d021080a/screenshot_spaceship-super-fund-3.png?w=950)\n\nThis
  gives us a more practical look at Spaceship’s exposure and shows us their tech weighting
  is actually 46%.\n\n## How does this affect Spaceship’s return?\n\nWe know Spaceship
  delivered a return of 18%, but where did those gains come from?\n\nNot tech. At
  least not yet.\n\nUsing the same customised worldview as above, a performance attribution
  report reveals 49% of Spaceship’s $10,563 return came from the Not Tech category.
  Old Tech was the second biggest return driver, comprising 15%. Media Tech was the
  closest category to a loss, delivering only 1%.\n\nThis is also a useful way to
  visualise how fees impact your portfolio. Fees took away more money from Spaceship’s
  return than Carsales, Salesforce, Priceline, Netflix, Expedia, and eBay delivered
  combined.\n\n![screenshot - Spaceship super fund 4](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2P5TJt1b0AGcy80QE4o4Oq/1576950e9e9c2ab172d12a21eeef631c/screenshot_spaceship-super-fund-4.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  single best performing industry inside the portfolio was banking. The Big Australian
  4 plus Wells Fargo delivered 18% of Spaceship’s total return. Perhaps disheartening
  to some, but reassuring to others.\n\n## So where is Spaceship heading? \n\nOne
  year’s performance is not enough time to judge a long-term investment. This portfolio
  was built based on information provided on a marketing website -- those are two
  important facts. Also, professional fund managers are paid to manage portfolios
  so this portfolio will change.\n\nResearch demonstrates Australians’ portfolios
  are underweight tech so Spaceship’s 46% exposure is a welcome entrant onto the scene.
  But the same findings show Australians’ portfolios suffer from home country bias,
  so what to make of 60% of the fund staying onshore? Is Spaceship not tech-focussed
  enough? Or is it too exposed to an Australian housing implosion? I could go on,
  but only the bottom line (or Sharesight) will be able to judge.\n\nInteresting to
  see what a technology portfolio looks like through the eyes of an Australian fund
  manager. Depending on classification, there are maybe five Australian tech companies
  in this portfolio of 72 stocks. On a valuation basis, this means less than 5% of
  the entire portfolio is devoted to local tech. To their credit they state plans
  to add private companies to their portfolio in 2017.\n\nHere’s hoping we see new
  Australian tech companies appear on Spaceship’s radar.\n\n## Questions young investors
  should ask\n\n24% of Sharesight users are under 34. They often ask for [investing
  tips](/blog/investing-tips/). In the case of Spaceship, I would encourage them to
  consider:\n\n1. **How risky is tech? What will the companies in this portfolio be
  doing in 10 years?**\n2. **Are you willing to hand back about 10% of your total
  return to a fund manager?**\n3. **Do you have other investments, and what are they
  exposed to?**\n4. **Where do you think the Australian economy is headed?**\n5. **Are
  you capable of building a similar portfolio yourself through shares and ETFs?**\n\nThere
  are more factors to consider, but those five questions are a good way to get the
  conversation going.\n\nSo far Spaceship has delivered returns in line with the global
  market. It will be interesting to see if tech carries the portfolio when interest
  rates rise and if we have a broad market selloff.\n\n## Track the Spaceship portfolio\n\nWe've
  made it easy for anyone to track the Spaceship portfolio. Here are 2 ways to do
  it:\n\n1. Anyone may view and track it via the [Spaceship Public Portfolio](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/spaceship-super/):\n
