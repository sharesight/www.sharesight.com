:title: AWI & ASX Fintech Expo - Roundup
:url_slug: awi-asx-fintech-expo-roundup
:content: "Last week we were given a chance to speak and host a stand at the Self-Directed
  Investor Fintech Expo, hosted by AWI and [ASX](https://www.asx.com.au). It was a
  terrific event with a great DIY investor turnout. Lots of curiosity following our
  Sharesight demo and lots of investors stopping by to learn more about Sharesight.
  Our basic theme was: \"ditch the spreadsheet.\"\n\n![Doug Morris from Sharesight

  are some exciting - and more importantly - some very real things going on in the
  Australian and New Zealand financial technology space. Running your investment life
  online is possible. Today.\n\n![AWI ASX - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4XCGN69fC0eKAAYm2M6iwu/e6ac88763d57d19febe393afb2123b41/featured_awi-asx.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  be honest, it can get lonely running an online business. Don't get me wrong, the
  Sharesight staff manages to have a lot of fun. But, much of our work is heads down,
  earphones on, hunched over laptops. That's why it's so nice to get together with
  fellow fintech companies to learn about what works, what doesn't, and to swap war
  stories.\n\n**A few presentations (and quotes) stood out:**\n\n---\n\n![Stockspot](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1adtSTnhUcMcuc6AuYyOYE/f2533ce8b6b26e4c7d9a14c627f504bd/logo_stockspot.jpg?w=950)\n\nYeah,
  we're [biased](/blog/announcing-new-strategic-partner-stockspot/). But, regardless
  of your stand on active versus passive investing, Stockspot represents one of the
  best elements of fintech: connected applications. Chris Brycki and his investment
  team use Desktop Broking (Bell) for execution, Macquarie CMAs for cash management,
  and Sharesight for client reporting. Much of what they've accomplished relies on
  off-the-shelf APIs and some clever (but lightweight) engineering. What does this
  mean for you, the investor? Transparently managed, responsible, low-cost portfolios.
  Chris had a quote that resonated when discussing the glut of index-hugging, high-fee
  fund managers: \"pay for alpha that counts, but rely on low-cost beta\"\n \n ---\n
  \n![Simply Wall St](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5wrCQY4kMMOk2KuiQAC4Sg/9b80f2aa97ba79c3410a4a1dc53c0b30/logo_simply-wall-st.png?w=950)\n\nInvesting
  is overly complex. Keep your research simple. Keep it visual. Those were the themes
  covered by Al Bentley from [Simply Wall Street](/blog/visualise-your-portfolio-with-sharesight-and-simply-wall-st/).
  We enjoyed their clever presentation and their snowflake charts. Very useful way
  to represent a company's financial health, discount to fair value, dividend yield,
  and past and future performance. Al didn't mention it specifically, but he addressed
  a topic that we're passionate about at Sharesight: KISS (\"keep it simple, stupid\").\n\n---\n\n![Livewire](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/AUG9nQJmYC0aKSKowuCAw/6e9b93d4843ececebaf473e13ff73330/logo_livewire.jpg?w=950)\n\nThis
  one caught our eye because of its simplicity. There's a lot of investment opinion
  out there - some of it high quality, some of it noise. [Livewire](/blog/livewire-market-insights-within-your-portfolio/)
  is like a curated twitter feed comprised of industry experts, top investing personalities,
  and well-respected research houses. Works great on mobiles too - I've already bookmarked
  it.\n\n---\n\n![Intelligent Investor](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4dtHuM3Rh66GswWkWEMSiO/0c4cd9bfe4c402bc2ade3ca714436b1e/logo_intelligent-investor.png?w=950)\nThese
  guys took a different approach. In a day filled with fast-talking product demos
  (me included), Jason Prowd took a step back and reminded the audience that you can
  be a successful stock picker but you must remain contrarian. It was a breath of
  fresh air. [Intelligent Investor](/blog/announcing-partnership-intelligent-investor/)
  has been around since 1998, but they're the first research house whose content and
  delivery looks appropriately contemporary. Over a giant picture of Warren Buffett,
  Jason reminded us: \"no one ever made money by not being contrarian.\"\n\n---\n\nInterestingly
  there was a lot of conflict amongst the products at the Expo. Stockspot told the
  crowd that returns come from asset allocation while Intelligent Investor reminded
  us that there are indeed high quality companies to be found. Simply Wall Street
  kept on the theme that the industry is basically designed to screw over the average
  investor, while Livewire has already tapped into more than 30,000 investors hungry
  for institutional-calibre research. Macrovue took the middle road and explained
  how to invest cost-effectively in global themes.\n\nThis kind of conflict is good.
  It means investors have choice. They can mix and match products that suit them best.
  Nearly every idea represented is a low-cost product that can be bought (and cancelled)
  online. (We already have a few discussions going about hooking-in to some of these
  exciting applications. Stay tuned for more details...)\n\n![ASX Ticker & AWI Logo](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/50Kdrpc59e6mW6S8Waas0y/2146f87de91bd3da42b03e76f30d011a/ASX-Ticker-AWI.jpg?w=950)\n\nIn
  a [follow-up article about the event](https://www.investordaily.com.au/latest-news/36694-fintech-start-ups-booming-says-awi),
  managing director of AWI Ventures Toby Heap summed it up nicely by saying, “ **innovation
  is crucial if financial services are to keep pace with technology-driven advances
  in other industries** ”. In the same article, Toby also said that Sharesight exemplifies
  \"the trend towards consumer empowerment\". That's definitely at the core of our
  DNA, so it's great to be recognized as such by our peers.\n\n### Sincere thanks
  to AWI and ASX for organising and hosting such a fantastic event, and to the other
  startups for participating in the expo. It's an exciting time to be part of the
  Fintech industry, and working alongside innovative companies like these makes it
  that much more fun.\n\n![AWI 2014 Fintech Expo](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6cTYLR4HjUg6kMSaKEQyyo/36610f905f78c64705a5590ac2666669/AWI_2014-FintechExpo_AWI.jpg?w=950)"
