:title: Auto-track your trades from Select Equities & Credit Suisse
:url_slug: select-equities-credit-suisse
:content: "We've added 2 more names to our ever-growing list of [supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  for automatic trade tracking: **Select Equities & Credit Suisse**.\n\n![Select Equities
  & Credit Suisse - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1IXmS6n4yAIeiOEUMgcsuS/d6223d04bc636d6074e76e6723eac1fa/featured_select-equities-credit-suisse.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Set up automatic trade tracking\n[Sharesight](/) can automatically record your trades
  by reading the PDFs from Trade Confirmation Emails that are emailed to you by your
  broker after a trade has completed. By default, every Sharesight portfolio has a
  unique email address that is at the ready and \"listening\" for trades. You may
  either manually forward your Trade Confirmation Emails to this email address, or
  better yet, ask your broker to include it as a recipient when they send out the
  trade confirmation email. Once received, Sharesight will \"read\" the Trade Confirmation
  Email and automatically record the trade details into your portfolio. Once the trade
  has been successfully recorded into your portfolio, a copy of the PDF from the Trade
  Confirmation Email will be saved to the holding within your portfolio, and you'll
  receive a confirmation email from Sharesight.\n\nWith the addition of Select Equities
  & Credit Suisse, **Sharesight currently processes Trade Confirmation Emails from
  over 90 brokers across Australia and New Zealand**. If you don't see your broker
  in our list of [supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/),
  please leave a comment on our [community forum](https://community.sharesight.com)
  so we can gauge interest and work towards supporting them in the future. \n\n###
