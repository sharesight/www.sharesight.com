  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nThis Australian
  reporting season was always going to be one to remember as listed companies reported
  on the peak period of disruption caused by COVID-19. We saw ‘Earnings per Share’
  growth in the ASX200 fall a remarkable 38% in the first six months of 2020[1]. For
  context, that was larger than what we experienced during the weakest point of the
  GFC (-20%). \n\nWith a full 40% of companies missing analysts’ earnings estimates,
  it can be difficult to separate the good from the bad. As professional investors
  though, we try to cut through the noise and the sensational headlines, to focus
  in on what really matters when assessing company performance and prospects for the
  long term. \n\nWe look for **quality companies**, which we define as having **five
  key characteristics**. I’d like to share our approach with you, with the hope that
  it helps you on your own investment journey.\n\n![Characteristics of quality companies](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5GCfZAuVIc0Rmc5ZdFZ28z/5bc7e6b881fafaaa492bc67212f1ce0f/Characteristics_of_quality_companies.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  The five key characteristics of quality companies\n\n### 1. Business prospects and
  strategy\n\nThe first question we ask ourselves when assessing companies is ‘do
  they have a strong strategy and prospects?’. Companies that do are better able to
  navigate uncertainty and capitalise on opportunities to create value. We look at
  how attractive the market sector dynamics are and the company’s position within
  that sector. This reporting season made clear that COVID-19 has hit some sectors
  much harder than others. The healthcare sector, for example, has been a clear beneficiary
  of changing demand in the market – particularly companies exposed to high demand
  medical equipment such as respiratory masks and humidification products (e.g. Fisher
  and Paykel, and Resmed). The energy sector, in contrast, has been hit hard by the
  collapse in oil and gas prices, as have a number of industrials such as airlines
  and airports. We expect the short to medium term outlook to remain challenging for
  these sectors as the global economy slowly recovers.\n\n### 2. Management\n\nWe
  are in the fortunate position to speak to the management of the companies that we’re
  investing in every six months. We’re assessing their experience, track record, and
  execution. We can then use the reporting season to assess whether they’re on track
  or not. A good example would be Xero, the SaaS accounting software provider; Xero’s
  management have set very clear milestones, and consistently reiterate these during
  the reporting season. Individual investors, of course, may not have the luxury of
  biannual management meetings, but I’d recommend half year and full year results
  presentations as useful to get a gauge on management’s strategy and execution.\n\n###
  3. Financials\n\nAn obvious one perhaps, but the financials of a company are an
  essential factor to analyse. We focus in particular on balance sheet strength. We
  like companies with strong cash-flow generation, return on capital and profit margins,
  as well as low gearing. Never are these factors more important than in times of
  severe economic pressure such as we’ve seen in 2020 so far. A2 Milk is one of those
  companies: holding over $800m cash on balance sheet (no debt) and generating c$400m
  of free cash flow in FY20[2], we view A2 Milk as a company with a significant buffer
  and the ability to ride out severe market dislocations.\n\n### 4. Transparency\n\nWe
  want to see a clean company structure. We also want transparency around earnings
  – can we see where the earnings are coming from? Are they recurring or one-off?
  Quality companies produce earnings that are more resilient and sustainable. And
  we also want to see cash-flow conversion i.e. how does the profit the company generates
  turn into cash in their bank account? Without sufficient transparency, we won’t
  invest our clients’ money.\n\n### 5. ESG\n\nWe believe that companies that give
  proper consideration to environmental, social and governance issues (‘ESG’) are
  more sustainable companies and will outperform over the long term. We embed assessment
  of these three factors into our investment process, and engage directly with companies
  on these matters. We’ve recently seen the negative fall-out for companies such as
  Rio Tinto, AMP and QBE when they fail to meet regulator or community expectations
  for these factors. I suggest you incorporate this framework into your assessment
  of a company’s risks, opportunities and long term prospects.\n\n## Insights from
  the latest ASX reporting season\n\nFor my reflections on an ASX reporting season
  to remember, watch this Sharesight webinar where I share important themes we have
  seen emerge, as well as sector-by-sector analysis and key stocks to watch.\n\n<a

  Quality companies succeed over the long term\n\nWhilst it’s been a tough year for
  so much of the market, we remain optimistic that companies with those characteristics
  can weather the storm, capitalise on favourable market trends, and enjoy success
  over the long term. As you can tell, we think it’s doing the fundamental research
  that gives you the best chance of finding quality stocks and exploiting market inefficiencies
  to deliver long term value. I hope the five characteristics of quality I’ve outlined
  above help you to assess companies and cut through the noise of reporting seasons
  like this one. Happy investing!\n\n###### Issued by Aberdeen Standard Investments
