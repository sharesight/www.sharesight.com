  This month we have been beavering away on a new multi-period performance report. It’s not quite ready for prime time yet but Expert plan customers can sneak a peek by [enabling beta features](https://help.sharesight.com/beta/) on the fresh new account preferences page. We’ll have more to say about this in the next release notes but meanwhile here’s what else we’ve been up to.
