  ## Who is CMC Markets?

The platform gives investors access to Australian stocks, ETFs and managed funds with brokerage fees starting from $11. CMC also offers international trades in stocks and ETFs with $0 brokerage fees, including major global markets such as the Nasdaq, New York (NYSE), London (LSE) and Toronto (TSX) stock exchanges, which are also [supported by Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/). Other features include investor education on trading strategies, technical and fundamental analysis, as well as access to investor news and market analyst commentary.

  ## Why you should import your CMC trades to Sharesight

  By importing your trades from CMC Markets Stockbroking to Sharesight, you can easily see the [complete picture of your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/) if you trade across multiple brokers and asset classes, plus unlock Sharesight’s advanced [tax reporting designed for Australian investors](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-australian-investors-at-tax-time/).

  Unlike the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight takes into account the impact of brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/) and [capital gains](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/) when calculating investment returns. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports for investors including [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/), [Portfolio Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/), [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/) and [Future Income](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/) (upcoming dividends). The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/), [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/) and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/) is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track their investment portfolio.

  ## How to import your CMC trades to Sharesight

  Investors trading through CMC Markets Stockbroking can easily [establish a secure connection](https://help.sharesight.com/import-your-historical-trading-data-and-sync-your-cmc_account/) between their CMC and Sharesight accounts, which will automatically import historical and ongoing trades into their portfolio. Investors who choose not to link their CMC and Sharesight accounts can also import their historical trading data by uploading a [spreadsheet file of trades](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/), or have their [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) automatically forwarded to Sharesight to capture ongoing trades.
