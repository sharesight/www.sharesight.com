:title: The exchange traded fund (ETF) tax nightmare
:url_slug: the-exchange-traded-fund-etf-tax-nightmare
:content: "ETFs have been a boon for self-directed investors, offering access to a
  basket of underlying investments, conveniently rolled-up into one security that
  trades like a stock. They’re listed on public exchanges and require small minimum
  investments. Launched in 1993, their popularity has soared with total assets scraping
  the USD $3.5T mark at the end of 2017. In fact, in 2018 21% of investors tracking
  their [SMSFs on Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/smsf-unbundling--how-much-can-it-save-you-in-2017/)
  bought or sold an ETF.* This is a significant increase on just 3% in 2008.\n\n![chart
  etf-trade-growth](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5M67iz0DdKUwcwyWcQm6ww/90df85fcbcbd4d3add1659460f4bf29c/chart_etf-trade-growth.png?w=950)\n\nNowadays
  there’s an ETF for everything: emerging markets, water scarcity, even cryptocurrencies.
  A colleague of mine owns a cybersecurity ETF (ticker: ASX: HACK) that’s returned
  39% in one year. I’ve personally owned ETFs that track commodity futures and one
  that shorted the real estate market.\n\nBut with this expanded investment menu of
  ready-access ETFs, Australian self-directed investors face complex realities. That’s
  because despite all the positive aspects of ETFs, in actuality they are a tax nightmare
  for Australian investors who’ve chosen to go off-platform or not rely on a managed
  service.\n\n## The ETF tax nightmare in Australia\n\nFor Australian investors, ETFs
  create tax complications because instead of classifying them as ordinary company
  shares, the ATO classifies ETFs as trusts. To make things more convoluted, in 2016
  the ATO changed the rules around investment trusts by creating the Attribution Managed
  Investment Trust (AMIT) regime.\n\nSince the vast majority of ETFs issue distributions
  (even those that are growth focused), investors face highly complex annual taxation
  statements. If you own an ETF, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about, and chances
  are your accountant does too!\n\n### An example of the ETF tax nightmare: Vanguard
  Australian Shares (VAS)\n\nIn our research, one purchase of VAS shares, which paid
  just four dividends throughout the year morphed into 17 distribution and two capital
  gains components on the annual taxation statement. In turn these correspond to 10
  items on an individual tax return. Staggering complexity for just one buy!\n\n![VAS

  annual tax statement 2018</small>\n\nWhy does this happen? VAS invests *[mostly](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8205/?portfolio)*
  in ASX shares, whose companies in turn pay dividends, are subject to [franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/dividend-franking-and-performance/)
  and which undergo corporate actions. This creates all sorts of tax implications.
  VAS also invests in unlisted securities, derivatives and overseas companies each
  with their own tax nuances.\n\nWhen you a run a portfolio that big, you need to
  leave room at the margins for inflows, outflows, rebalancing and hedging. It’s impossible
  for a portfolio manager to be 100% exposed to their core mandate at all times. And
  the VAS portfolio changes daily, which means the underlying components of each distribution
  will be different quarter to quarter as corporate actions occur, or the portfolio
  turns over so when you buy in or sell out impacts your annual tax situation.\n\nAs
  time goes by, you receive VAS distributions in cash (usually quarterly or half yearly),
  along with a simple statement from the registry showing the net payment. At the
  end of the year, the registry will send you a final statement.\n\nThese final statements
  contain all of the component and subcomponent information and are far more detailed
  than what you received during the year. This information can *retroactively modify
  your cost base and taxable dividend income*, making your tax lodgement very difficult
  and risking investors \npaying more tax than they need to.\n\n## How fintech is
  easing the ETF tax nightmare\n\nFintechs like Sharesight have created the expectation
  for real-time investment information. Once-per-year investment statements are no
  longer good enough for investors seeking accurate performance data about their hard-earned
  investment portfolios.\n\nCase in point: in order to provide accurate performance
  and tax reporting for our clients, we sought to improve the depth and accuracy of
  exchange traded funds (ETFs) distribution data for our self-directed clients and
  partners.\n\nWe knew this would be a big undertaking, but it proved more difficult
  than anticipated. After beginning our journey we realised there was a lack of information
  and even clear rules available to investors. No one at the ASX, the ETF providers,
  professional firms, or even the share registries held the answer — but all recognised
  the problem.\n\nIdeally, we thought we’d license the detailed distribution data
  from the registries or ETF managers on an ongoing basis. This proved impossible
  because they don’t calculate the data as the tax year progresses. It’s just one
  opaque process at year end.\n\nFortunately, Computershare came to the table and
  agreed to provide us with the detailed information for some of the most popular
  ETFs as soon as the financial year ended. [We use this data](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/)
  as a basis for calculating the distribution components for the 2017 and 2018 Australian
  financial years.\n\nUnfortunately, not all the registries were able to provide data
  for their ETFs. We have no idea how it can be that a registry can send personalised
  taxation statements out to millions of Australians but not be able to provide even
  notional data to software companies like Sharesight. In some cases we did receive
  sample data, but not always in a useable format.\n\nAfter months of hard work, including
  working with our robo-advice partner Six Park, tracking down the right people at
  Computershare, and even buying ETFs ourselves in a Sharesight company account just
  to get the statements, we have managed to build a solution that simplifies ETF tax
  administration for self-directed investors. After months of research we could not
  find clear answers from the industry, so we believe our feature hits the mark in
  terms of both accuracy and usability. Hopefully our efforts to serve DIY investors
  push the industry towards better reporting standards.\n\n## ETFs remain terrific
  investment options\n\nETFs have helped democratise investing. I use them myself
  for long and short term investing and support [Sharesight partners](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/)
  who use them as building blocks for their clients’ portfolios. However, it seems
  that the zest to market new ‘easy’ ETF investment products wasn’t matched by an
  ease in tax administration. \n\nThe reality is that all investments have a tax implication
  of some kind. For example, ASX-listed stocks are vulnerable to future franking credit
  decisions. And now ETFs bring their own tax complexities. This is just a new piece
  of the puzzle investors must keep in mind when building and administering their
  portfolios.\n\n###### Important Disclaimer. We do not provide tax or investment
  advice. The buying of shares can be complex and varies per individual. You should
  seek tax and investment advice specific to your situation before acting on any of
  the information in this article.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- [How Sharesight makes
