:title: We have had another share market collapse. So what?

:content: "### My top 5 points to ponder before you act on the latest share market
  collapse\n\nJust when we thought the worst was over, the share market takes another
  tumble.\n\nI know we have to be mindful about what is happening overseas but things
  are much better in Australia and NZ so what is the problem? \n\nIf, like me, you
  are not sure what the problem is we are in good company. Retail king Gerry Harvey
  was recently quoted as saying ‘Australians should be as happy as pigs in shit with
  low unemployment and a resources boom, but instead they're scared to spend money’.\n\nSo
  it looks like we are not spending money and we are taking it out of the share market
  as well. But where is all this new-found cash going? If it’s reducing debt great,
  but if you think it might be safer under the bed because the share market is heading
  south, here are my top 5 points to ponder before you take action.\n\n1. The share
  market is volatile – you knew that before you invested. Dramatic gains can be offset
  by equally dramatic losses. But history shows very clearly that in the long run
  our markets produce good returns with gains exceeding losses.\n\n2. Don’t over-emphasise
  what happens today. It is human nature to do this but current events, good or bad,
  are not the way to gauge what will happen in the long run.\n\n3. To ensure you can
  maintain a long-term focus, only invest cash that you are sure you will not need
  for short-term requirements.\n\n4. If the market takes a tumble you have made a
  paper loss; not a real one. Ask yourself if you know a better place (under the bed?)
  to put your money than in share market – especially when it is at low point! **As
  long as you don’t bail out you are guaranteed to participate 100% in the inevitable
  bounce back!**\n\n5. Finally remember that doing something is not necessarily better
  that doing nothing. Besides doing nothing is easier and in the case of the share
  market, may well produce a better result.\n\n<small>*This information is not a recommendation
