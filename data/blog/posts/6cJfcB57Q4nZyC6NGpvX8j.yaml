:title: What is dividend yield?
:content: "If you’ve ever considered getting into dividend investing, you’ve probably
  looked into stocks with high dividend yields. While this is a valid investment strategy,
  it’s important to understand some of the pitfalls of choosing a stock based on its
  dividend yield, and how you can avoid falling into the \"dividend yield trap\".
  To learn more about dividend yields, the pros and cons of dividend investing and
  why Sharesight is the ultimate tool to [keep track of your dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/),
  keep reading. \n\n![What is dividend yield](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4mTNQ8RRi804b1itzBJKUU/1ac9da6e7f987db1f819c64b573930d8/What_is_dividend_yield.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is dividend yield? \n\nSome companies choose to pay dividends, which means
  a portion of their income is divided amongst their shareholders. The dividend yield
  is simply a percentage term that shows how much the company has paid out in dividends
  relative to its share price. Hence, this number can be obtained by dividing the
  dividend price by the share price and converting this to a percentage. \n\n## What
  is the dividend yield formula?\n\nThe dividend yield formula is the annual dividend
  per share, written as a percentage of the current share price. For example, if a
  company’s annual dividends are $5 and the stock is trading at $100, then the dividend
  yield is $100 / $5 = 5%.\n\n## How is the dividend yield calculated?\n\nWhen determining
  a company's dividend yield, you will need to look at its most up-to-date dividend
  paid per share as well as the price their shares are currently trading at on the
  market. You can find these details in the company’s annual financial report or by
  [looking up the dividend value](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/quickly-view-the-performance-of-any-stock-with-the-share-checker/)
  in Sharesight. \n\nAnother more nuanced way to determine dividend yield is to look
  at the \"trailing\" dividend yield. This method gives the dividend percentage paid
  over a period of time, usually a year. Given over a period of 12 months, a trailing
  dividend yield will include all dividends paid in the previous year in the final
  calculation of the dividend yield.\n\n## What does the dividend yield tell you?
  \n\nDividend yield can be one measure of a company’s financial success, and can
  give you an indication into whether or not you should invest in the company. In
  conjunction with the dividend yield, it can be helpful to look at the dividend growth
  rate, as together these give a clearer picture of the potential future success of
  the company. For example, a high dividend yield can indicate good returns, with
  a steady and medium to high dividend growth rate indicating that these dividend
  yields won’t fluctuate excessively or dry up quickly. However, a high dividend yield
  could also mean that less money is being invested back into the company, which could
  potentially slow its development. \n\nIt’s important to note that focusing only
  on the dividend yield when looking to invest can cause you to fall into what is
  known as the \"[dividend yield trap](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-dividend-yield-trap/)\".
  As the dividend yield is calculated by looking at the dividend per share divided
  by the price of the share, dividend yield may sometimes give a false perception
  of success. This can happen when the stock price decreases and makes the dividend
  yield ratio appear strong, which can encourage investment in an underperforming
  stock.\n\nIt should also be noted that fluctuations in the market aren’t always
  reflected by the dividend yield. While the price of a stock may fluctuate as investors
  anticipate changes to dividend yield payments, the dividend yield is decided by
  a company’s board of directors, not market conditions, and the dividend yield will
  only reflect the most recent dividend payments.\n\nIn general, it is important to
  consider more than just the dividend yield when evaluating an investment opportunity.
  Other important factors include fundamental business conditions, the history of
  the stock, the average dividend payment, the relationships between the dividend
  yield and share price, and the dividend growth rate. \n\n## What are the pros and
  cons of dividend yield investing? \n\nPurchasing dividend stocks comes with a range
  of pros, including:\n\n* Purchasing dividend stocks is generally a less risky investment
  than stocks that don’t provide dividends. \n\n* Dividend stocks can provide a good,
  steady stream of income as long as the investor is willing to hold onto them for
  the long term. \n\n* The dividend policy of a company can indicate its future growth
  and performance, and with a good record of dividend payments, a company is more
  likely to be reliable and a good investment.\n\n* Dividend income may be tax-advantaged,
  for instance, franking credits in Australia \n\nHowever, purchasing dividend stocks
  also comes with pitfalls, such as:\n\n* Purchasing based on dividend yield alone
  can cause you to fall into the dividend yield trap and potentially purchase underperforming
  shares. Purchasing stocks with the highest dividend yield isn’t always a recipe
  for success.\n\n* Companies are under no obligation to pay a specific dividend yield
  or to even pay them at all. Buying stock in a company in the hope of consistent
  dividends providing a steady income stream can lead to disappointment if the company
  stops paying dividends.\n\n* Stock prices can fall if dividend yields are cut, as
  investors may lose faith in the company.\n\n## What is the average dividend yield?\n\nThe
  average dividend yield varies between countries, sectors, and stocks. For example,
  in 2020 the United Kingdom offered the best [average dividend yield](https://siblisresearch.com/data/global-dividend-yields/),
  with the yield of the FTSE All-Share Index being 4.66% at the end of June 2020.
  India offered the lowest yield during the same period at 1.55%, while Australia’s
  dividend yield was 4.39%.\n\n## What is the difference between earnings yield and
  dividend yield?\n\nThe earnings yield is the earnings per share (EPS) for the most
  recent 12-month period divided by the share price, whereas the dividend yield is
  the ratio of the dividend paid out to the market price of the share.\n\n## Automatically
