:title: 2017 stock picking competition - April update
:content: "With one quarter and an earning’s season in the books, it’s time for our
  second update on the [Sharesight](/) & [Livewire](/blog/livewire-market-insights-within-your-portfolio/)
  stock picking competition!\n\nIn December 2016 we sent the [call out](/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition/)
  for your picks for the 2017 calendar year. We’re comparing the performance of the
  most popular picks from the Sharesight customer base, the Livewire readership, and
  some of Australia’s top fund managers -- and of course tracking them in Sharesight.\n\n![featured
  - 2017 stock picking competition - April update](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/61Z0xAjD7a6KkuuCYi8go4/16e0a2025979f428cb86b3e115028bf6/featured_2017-stock-picking-competition-apr-update.jpg?w=950)\n\nWe
  checked in on each portfolio in [February](/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition--february-update/)
  and the Sharesight customers were well ahead of the pack. So where do we stand now?\n\n##
  Performance since 1 January 2017\n\nThe tables have turned. Livewire reader picks
  have returned over 3%, the Expert Picks managed a small gain, and the Sharesight
  customer picks are in the red. None of the portfolios have beaten the benchmark.\n\nWe’ve
  also had a late entrant to our competition. [Six Park](/blog/announcing-a-new-partner--six-park/),
  one of our robo-advice partners, saw our blog and asked if they could get in on
  the action. \n\nI told Pat Garret, their CEO, that indexers were always trying to
  cherry pick opportunities to make stock pickers look bad so he agreed to acknowledge
  their portfolios are just that -- constructed portfolios -- whereas our stock picking
  competition is based on individual picks with no regard for what else an investor
  might hold.\n\nLet’s think of our indexing friends in Melbourne as friendly umpires.
  Six Park charges 50 basis points annually. We’ll levy that fee at the end of the
  competition. I reminded Pat that the only constant in investing are the fees you
  pay.\n\n| Portfolio | Total Return %     | Total Return $     |\n| ---------- |
  ---------- | ---------- |\n| Sharesight       | <span style=\"color:red\">-0.85%</span>
  | <span style=\"color:red\">-$4,276.36</span>    |\n| Fund Managers       | 0.58%
  \      | $2,898.13       |\n| Livewire       | 3.12%       | $15,589.71       |\n|
  Benchmark<br>ASX 200 (STW)    | 6.21%       | $6,202.78       |\n| Six Park - Aggressive
  Growth    | 4.02%       | $20,080.45       |\n| Six Park - Balanced    | 3.21%       |
  $16,042.75       |\n\n## What’s driving the returns?\nThough the Sharesight portfolio
  is currently in last place, their pick of Sirtex Medical (SRX) is up a blistering
  23%. This masks the dog in their portfolio, Retail Food Group (RFG), which has lost
  23%.\n\nThe Livewire portfolio has been fairly even keel with QBE Insurance (QBE)
  delivering over 8%, and Altium (ALU) down 3%.\n\nThe Experts’ selection of Imdex
  (IMD) is the best returning stock of their portfolio, up 10%. Event Hospitality
  (EVT) is down almost 5%.\n\nDividends buoy some of these returns to be sure, something
  especially true of Australian stocks. Centrepoint Alliance, an Expert pick and our
  dividend leader, paid out $4,726.41, which nearly makes up for their $5,900 capital
  loss.\n\nAs for Six Park, their allocation to the Van Eck Infrastructure ETF (IFRA)
  and the Vanguard Emerging Markets (VGE) ETF has been their best performers -- each
  up just over 7%.\n\nRemember the best way to analyse the return characteristics
  of these portfolios is to [request access](https://goo.gl/forms/NDKU7TOFmHlObHHF3)
  and run a [Contribution Analysis Report](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/).\n\n###
  Portfolio notes\n- We’ve “invested” $100,000 in each holding while assuming a brokerage
  fee for each buy transaction of $9.95.\n- All dividends are/will be included in
  the total performance calculation, and are reinvested. Total performance also factors
  in currency effects.\n- Performance figures are total return (versus annualised)
  as none of the portfolio positions has been held for longer than one year.\n- The
  benchmark return figure assumes that all $500,000 was invested in the benchmark
  ETF.\n\n### All articles in this series\n- [2017 stock picking competition](/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition/)\n-
