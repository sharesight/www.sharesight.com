:title: How to evaluate and record stock buybacks
:content: "Companies will sometimes offer to purchase stocks back from investors in
  what is known as a ‘stock buyback’. As an investor, it’s important to understand
  why stock buybacks occur, how to evaluate them, and whether you should participate
  in them -- even at a discount.\n\n![How to evaluate and record stock buybacks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4vevLdSwikpF2iYgh8lHHO/400d723781d197fed37af4c77cffa6df/How_to_evaluate_and_record_stock_buybacks.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Why do companies conduct stock buybacks\n\nStock buybacks are one way of delivering
  value to shareholders that is common in many markets, and are often used as an alternative
  to paying dividends in countries where dividend income is taxed less favourably
  than capital gains, [such as the USA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033015/there-difference-between-capital-gains-and-dividend-income.asp).\n\nStock
  buybacks benefit shareholders indirectly by reducing the total number of shares
  on issue. This makes the remaining shares more valuable, as each share owns a greater
  percentage of the company’s earnings. Of course, if a company spends cash buying
  back overvalued shares that subsequently fall in price then the buyback can be bad
  for shareholder value -- but that is another issue. Warren Buffet has discussed
  this in [many of his Berkshire annual letters](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stock-buybacks-20190215-story.html).\n\nIn
  Australia, where [franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/)
  make dividends quite attractive from a tax perspective, stock buybacks are typically
  driven by the desire to use these franking credits most tax effectively and generally
  take a specific [\"off-market\" buyback](https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/You-and-your-shares-2018/?page=21)
  form where the company will invite shareholders to bid for shares usually at a discount
  to the prevailing market price.\n\n## Why participate in a stock buyback at a discount?\n\nTypically,
  the price paid in an on-market buyback will be the prevailing market price. In Australia,
  however, it’s common for investors to be *paid at a discount to the prevailing price*
  -- often as much as 14% below the current market price. In return, these investors
  receive a payment that is mostly made up of a[ franked dividend](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/),
  which carries tax advantages.\n\nThe tradeoff here is that you are selling at a
  discount but you are receiving the majority of the payment as a franked dividend
  which carries with it a tax credit for the tax already paid by the company. This
  means that if you have a zero or low marginal tax rate, you can come out ahead of
  just selling the shares at the market price through an exchange. [Australian SMSF
  members](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  in pension mode are often the ones most advantaged by this structure, whereas shareholders
  on higher marginal tax rates are unlikely to benefit by participating at a discount.
  NABtrade recently put together some [examples for the Woolworths discounted share
  buyback](https://www.nabtrade.com.au/investor/insights/latest-news/news/2019/04/analysis_of_woolwort)
  which demonstrate how this can work.\n\n## How do you record stock buybacks in Sharesight?\n\nStock
  buybacks can appear quite complicated, but when you boil them down as simply as
  possible, stock buybacks usually have three components:\n\n1. **A buyback price**:
  Which may be less than the market price for the stock if there is franking attached
  to the buyback. \n\n2. **A franked dividend (only in Australia)**: The bulk of the
  payment will be in the form of a franked dividend. This should be recorded as a
  *franked dividend* in Sharesight. The franking credit should also be recorded in
  that income payment.\n\n3. **A capital component**: This should be recorded as a
  sale transaction in Sharesight equal to the capital component. The company will
  normally provide all this information to you on a per share basis.\n\nOnce both
  the sale and dividend components are entered into Sharesight, you will see corresponding
  sale transaction and income payment records for the stock buyback. You can see these
  for the [Woolworths 2019 stock buyback](https://help.sharesight.com/au/woolworths-share-buyback/)
  on the 27th and 30th May in our example below:\n\n![Stock buyback franking credit
  dividend](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3WfWgRGH4pEbUKDAYHhDWs/e1cea47d37259c6cac2f52b80f6f2726/Stock_buyback_franking_credit_dividend.png?w=950)\n\nNow
  this is where it can get a bit tricky if you’re an Australian investor. The dividend
  and the capital component will equal the buyback price, but there is a catch. The
  ATO and the company will work out a [deemed CGT component](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Selling-an-asset-and-other-CGT-events/Types-of-CGT-events/)
  which is an extra amount (not included in the buyback price) that must be added
  to your sale price for the stock sold. This component sometimes has slightly different
  names but the company will normally provide the number.\n\n![Franking credit share

  present this bit is not automated in Sharesight. You can't just add the deemed CGT
  component to your sale price as it will exceed the cash you received and impact
  your performance calculations. However, you can handle this manually in Sharesight
  by recording a note on the sale transaction, then when you [calculate your capital
  gains tax with Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/),
  you can add this amount to the capital component above.\n\nThat's it. There are
  some permutations of the above but this is the basic formula. As always you should
  seek tax advice if you are not clear on how to apply this to your situation.\n\n##
