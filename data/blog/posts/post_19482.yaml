:title: A new partnership with CMC Markets
:url_slug: a-new-partnership-with-cmc-markets
:content: "We’re proud to announce a new partnership with CMC Markets! Now [CMC clients
  in their Premium Traders](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/) tier will have access to
  [Sharesight Investor Plan](/pricing/) for **no cost**. Building off our [existing
  relationship](/blog/sharesight-teams-up-with-cmc-markets-stockbroking/), in which
  CMC trade and holdings data is shared automatically with Sharesight, investors who
  place at least 30 trades per month will now have access to up to three portfolios
  with unlimited holdings and trades on Sharesight as part of their CMC package.\n\nBottom
  line, if you trade with CMC you don’t need to setup your portfolio. It’s done with
  one click of the mouse, with all on-going trades coming through automatically. It’s
  like Sharesight’s existing portfolio setup process on steroids. Online broking and
  Sharesight go hand in hand. CMC gets this, which is why they were our first brokerage
  partner and were keen to put a second arrangement in place. \n\n![CMC + Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4ro1bIhMr6mKaEWeM2McYU/c1e9c9ca453e4ba2e5e982ff8ac296e7/cmc-screenshot.png?w=950)\n<sub>It’s
  a no brainer mate, CMC & Sharesight makes sense.</sub>\n\nSometimes investors (and
  even accountants and advisers) ask us “why?” “Why do I need a portfolio tool when
  I can see my holdings and performance on my broker’s website?” For starters unless
  you’ve kept your business with one broker since day one of your first dollar invested,
  your historical cost basis will be incorrect. Most people transfer [CHESS sponsored](/blog/what-is-chess/)
  holdings from one broker to the next. Once moved across, your historical costs basis
  is lost so any performance “calculation” incorrectly begins with whatever balance
  you’ve transferred. Also, since your broker isn’t always privy to dividends (reinvested
  or paid out) or holdings you have on wraps, platforms, or with other institutions,
  your preferred online broker is likely not giving you an accurate or complete picture.\n\nFurthermore
  come tax time, most online brokers don’t offer comprehensive capital gains or dividend
  income tax calculation, nor reporting tools. Nor do they want to build them. That
  where Sharesight comes in. If you use CMC, for example, your capital gains, losses,
  and dividend income are all sent through to our tax reports automatically, at the
  close of each trading day.\n\n![CMC + Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/150lvluMncYqWqc8WYKAMs/5a75e6c93976a2b4171aedc3360db64d/cmc-screenshot-1.png?w=950)
  \n\nLast, but not least, if you’ve enabled your [Sharesight + Xero](/xero/) connection
  that means when you (or your client) make a trade that information goes from CMC
  to Sharesight to Xero in real time. And automatically without human intervention.
  This represents a key milestone in our effort to build and encourage an investing
  ecosystem in which you, the investor, have choice of services and can easily transport
  your data from one system to the next.\n\nThe way we see it, if you can book a holiday
  and organise a travel itinerary by using your Facebook login, you sure as hell should
  be able to have your broker talk to your accounting platform.\n\n![CMC + Sharesight
  + Xero](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4B4P2IQGUE0uS2s4eqUiei/7c8dbb85d242bf2af28d845a8d33bb52/cmc-sharesight-xero.png?w=950)
  \n\nIf trading technology and low cost trading is important to you, then check out
  CMC Markets. They do most of their development in house, which is rare for a broker
  and means they’re on the leading edge of investing tools.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n-
