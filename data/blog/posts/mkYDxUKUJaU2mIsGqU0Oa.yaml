:title: How to calculate your 2018 FIF income
:url_slug: how-to-calculate-your-2018-fif-income
:content: "###### NOTE: There is a newer version of this article. See [*How to calculate
  your NZ FIF income*](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/) for more information.\n\nPortfolio
  tax reporting can be a real hassle. This is especially true for New Zealand residents
  with offshore holdings such as foreign shares and managed funds. That’s because
  certain overseas holdings are taxed under the New Zealand foreign investment fund
  (FIF) rules, which means there are special tax requirements for investors who hold
  them.\n\nAs a New Zealand based company, [Sharesight](/) was built for self-directed
  Kiwi investors. To help you navigate the FIF rules, we’ve pulled together some background
  information on the scheme, including some recent changes that have taken place.
  We’ll also show you how to use Sharesight to determine whether your holdings are
  subject to the foreign investment rules, and automatically calculate your FIF income
  if that’s the case.\n\n![featured nz-dollars-calculator](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5UBMMTUmI0yIaIa2iqWYCO/fa23f0b752d9858af708a2a2ef9a2d71/featured_nz-dollars-calculator.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a foreign investment fund (FIF)?\nAs stated by the New Zealand Inland Revenue
  Department (IRD), a foreign investment fund (FIF) is an offshore investment held
  by a New Zealand-resident taxpayer who holds:\n\n- less than 10% of the shares in
  a foreign company\n- less than 10% of the units in a foreign unit trust\n- between
  10% and 40% of the shares in a foreign company which is not a CFC\n- an interest
  in a life insurance policy where a FIF is the insurer and the policy is not offered
  or entered into in New Zealand\n- an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme\n\nIt
  does not include interest earned from term deposits, bonds, debentures or money
  lent. \n\n## Changes to FIF exemptions\nBefore we go any further, here’s a bit of
  background information:\n\n- In previous years, the IRD published an Australian
  share exemption lists – also known as the IR871.\n- The list indicated whether an
  Australian company listed on the ASX (excluding listed investment companies) was
  exempt from the FIF rules for that financial year.\n- The IRD enacted changes from
  1 April 2017 to simplify the exemptions list.\n- The key change is basically the
  removal of any reference to an approved index and instead the company simply has
  to be on the official list of ASX limited (other rules still apply).\n- These changes
  take effect for the 2017-2018 tax year and beyond.\n\n## Steps to calculate your
  2017-2018 FIF income\nAs a result of these IRD rules, investors who have certain
  types of overseas investments may have FIF income. And while the IRD has an online
  tool that lets you check if you are required to do anything under the FIF rules,
  if you determine that you do, the actual calculations can get quite complicated.\n\nThe
  good news is that **investors on a [Sharesight NZ Expert](https://www.sharesight.com/nz/pricing/)
  or [Sharesight NZ Pro plan](https://www.sharesight.com/nz/pro/) can run their own
  [FIF Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/new_fdr_report_page/) in just a few
  clicks.** Here’s how to do it:\n\n### 1. Determine which of your holdings are subject
  to FIF\nSharesight automatically flags any holdings within your portfolio which
  are subject to FIF rules:\n\n![screenshot - Sharesight FIF Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/52cehHtLAsG4WiWS8GEY8e/b9d8357bc6fee8d4c95bba06ae0b5c43/screenshot_fif-2018.png?w=950)\n\n######
  NOTE: Update 29 March - we have updated the list of holdings and taken the FIF report
  out of \"draft\" mode.<br><br>We recommend double-checking your FIF-included companies
  against the IRD calculator. If you notice any holdings that are not automatically
  included/excluded by Sharesight, please leave a message on our [dedicated forum
  topic](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/how-to-calculate-your-2018-fif-income).\n\n###
  2. Calculate your ‘peak holding balance’\nSharesight determines whether you exceed
  the FIF threshold ($50,000 for individuals). Based on the example above, the answer
  is “yes” because the peak balance is $168,385.34.\n\n### 3. Calculate your FIF income\nIf
  you exceed the FIF threshold, clicking the “Calculate” button will automatically
  calculate your FIF income under both the [Fair Dividend Rate Method](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/fdr_income_fif_reports_page/)
  and [Comparative Value Method](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/cv_method_fif_reports_page/)
  (generally you are permitted to use either methodology, but check with your accountant
  if you are unsure as there are some exceptions):\n\n![screenshot - Sharesight FIF

  struggle with maths equations and complicated tax rules when Sharesight can calculate
  your FIF income for you, in just a few clicks? Our Expert and Pro plan clients agree:\n\n>
  I used the FIF reports for the first time and it greatly assisted the preparation
  of 2013/14 years tax returns. Sent copies of report to IRD with the returns and
  it was no problem. Well done Sharesight and well worth upgrading to include this
  reporting facility.<br>\n<cite>RICHARD MADDREN — SHARESIGHT CLIENT SINCE 2008</cite>\n\n>
