:title: Why accurate performance measurement matters
:url_slug: why-accurate-performance-measurement-matters
:content: "It’s not uncommon to see stock market performance measurement being described
  inaccurately in the press. But an article in today’s (23/11/11) Financial Review
  in the Portfolio section entitled [Cult of Equity is losing its Followers](http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/private-equity/cult-of-equity-is-losing-its-followers-20111122-j3qqm)
  by John McDuling is one of the more confused I have seen. Here are the opening paragraphs:\n\n>
  To say that the past two decades have been kind to investors in equities is an understatement.
  \ \nBetween October 1991 and October 2011, Australian shares returned investors
  433 percent, including dividends, or 22 per cent per annum. \nThat is way ahead
  of more defensive assets such as cash or bonds, according to analysis by Commsec’s
  Craig James.  \nHe says if $100,000 had been invested in stocks 20 years ago it
  would have been worth $804000 at the start of this year. That same $100,000 would
  have appreciated to just less than $305,000 in cash.\n\nThe article basically goes
  on to say that returns are unlikely to be as good in the next 20 years. Well, yes,
  I can almost guarantee they won’t be 22% p.a. But they haven’t been 22% over the
  last 20 years either.\n\nThe problem is that the return presented of 433 percent
  return over twenty years is not 22 percent per annum using **compounded** growth.
  The author has simply divided 433%/20 years = 21.6% which is the simple growth rate
  (similar to the simple growth in Sharesight) but it is highly misleading in this
  context. Using compound growth, which allows you to compare it to the way other
  investments are presented, the annual return is **8.7%** , a far more reasonable
  number and actually slightly below long term equity returns. 100K compounded at
  22% over 20 years would be **$5,336,000!** If you are Warren Buffett this sort of
  return is possible but it is certainly far higher than the overall market in the
  last 20 years.\n\nA long run figure of 8.7%, however is perhaps not so unreasonable
  over a long period. The Future Fund has a target return of inflation + 5%. With
  inflation RBA inflation goals of 2 to 3% this implies 7 to 8% annual growth over
  the long term. A bit lower than than the last 20 years but no drastically so.\n\nWhy
  does all this matter? Well all the current crop of articles with this theme (and
  I have seen many as the market has declined) result in investors potentially underestimating
  the growth potential of the market relative to its history and moving out of equities
  at precisely the wrong time. It could prove to be a very expensive decision for
  investors. This is why we are so passionate here at Sharesight about investors understanding
  their true return. We think it’s critical to successful portfolio management\n\nIt’s
  important to know your returns and set some realistic expectations about future
  growth. With high single digit growth rates the magic of compounding will see your
  investments grow very nicely indeed if you are prepared to give them the time to
  deliver. \n\n**Update: 2:25pm**\n\nIn the online version of their article the Fin
  have corrected the calculation and have now put 8.7% as the annualised return into
  the story. Obviously someone else has pointed out the error but the story makes
  even less sense now!\n\n<small>*This information is not a recommendation nor a statement
