  Sharesight is the ultimate tool for Canadian investors to track all of their investments
  in one place. To learn more about how investors can benefit from tracking their
  Questrade investments in Sharesight, keep reading.\n\n![Automatically import your
  Questrade trades into Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/01rGR8lPAtPs94HEqiTxxq/2cc3692f456865e1fdcb7fcabb7e13ea/Automatically_import_your_Questrade_trades_into_Sharesight_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is Questrade? \n\nEstablished in 1999, [Questrade](https://www.questrade.com/home)
  is a Canadian-based brokerage and wealth management firm with an online trading
  platform. Questrade allows investors to trade stocks and ETFs on Canadian and US
  exchanges, as well as Canadian mutual funds, which are [supported by Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  Other key features include research tools such Intraday Trader, a trading pattern
  recognition software, and news feeds, research and analysis from Questrade’s partners.
  \n\n## Why you should track Questrade trades with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your
  Questrade trades to Sharesight (along with the rest of your investments), you can
  easily [track your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/au/investment-portfolio-performance/)
  across different brokers, asset classes and [over 40 global markets](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),
  including the **CNSX**, **CVE** and **TSE**. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful
  reports for investors including Performance, Portfolio Diversity, Contribution Analysis,
  Multi-Period and Multi-Currency Valuation, plus a Canadian-specific Capital Gains
  Tax Report. The ability to track cash accounts, property, [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  and [over 40,000 Canadian mutual funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-canadian-mutual-funds-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that Canadian investors should consider using Sharesight
  to track their investment portfolio.\n\n### Track your dividend income\n\nUnlike
  other portfolio trackers, Sharesight automatically [tracks dividend and distribution
  income](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/) (including [dividend reinvestment
  plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/))
  and takes this into account when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make a significant contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the importance of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more
  than just capital gains in its performance calculations.\n\n![Questrade stock holding

  Calculate your capital gains tax\n\nSharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/)
  is the ultimate CGT calculator for Canadian investors. The report automatically
  determines capital gains made on sold shares as per the [Canadian tax rules](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4037/capital-gains.html),
  eliminating the need for investors to make manual calculations, which can be complex
  and subject to error. Other convenient features include the ability to optimise
  your tax position by carrying losses forward, as well as a breakdown of your portfolio’s
  short-term and long-term capital gains and losses.\n\n## How to import your Questrade
  trades to Sharesight\n\nIt’s easy to import your historical Questrade trades to
  a Sharesight portfolio using the [File Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  feature. This feature allows you to import your trades by uploading a spreadsheet
  file filled with trades – making it a convenient way to bulk import historical trades.
  If you’re looking to add just one or two trades to your portfolio, it is recommended
  that you [add these trades manually](https://help.sharesight.com/au/adding-buy-and-sell-trades-or-adjustments-manually/).
  All you need to enter a trade manually are key details including the stock code,
  trade date, quantity of shares, the share price and the value of the brokerage fee
  (if applicable). \n\n## Start tracking your Questrade trades with Sharesight\n\nThousands
