  Investors using Sharesight can now benchmark their portfolios using any stock, ETF, mutual/managed fund or unit trust that [Sharesight currently supports](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/). This expands Sharesight’s portfolio benchmark feature to over 240,000 different instruments, and lets investors compare and contrast the performance of their portfolio against a *world of investments.*

  ## Benchmarking portfolios in Sharesight

  For quite some time, users have been able to benchmark their portfolio performance against any [exchange traded fund available in Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/). Exchange traded funds make for excellent ‘index tracking’ benchmarks because they take into account all the inner workings of a real portfolio, including fees, dividends and any [franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/dividend-franking-and-performance/) that may apply, whereas an index is purely theoretical.

  After releasing our ETF benchmarking feature, Sharesight users called for us to [expand our benchmarking feature](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/benchmark-against-managed-funds-not-only-etfs) to include mutual/managed funds, stocks, and unit trusts. We’ve now opened up these additional instrument types in Sharesight’s benchmarking feature, so users can take their benchmarking to the next level.

  ## How to choose a portfolio benchmark in Sharesight

  From the [Portfolio Overview page](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/), click on the "Add a Benchmark" button. In the “Search for a Benchmark” field, type the market code and select the desired instrument from the results (in the image below, we entered a managed fund that tracks the ASX 300 index - the __VAN0002AU.FundAU__ Vanguard Australian Shares Index Fund).

  Then select the "Graph performance index" option in the chart type drop-down menu to see your performance against the benchmark:

  ### How benchmarking works in Sharesight

  Sharesight’s benchmarking engine assumes a common investment amount and start date to calculate the benchmark’s performance. In this instance we’ve selected a time period of "since first purchase" which will set the benchmark start date to the date of the first holding purchased in the portfolio – though there are other options available.

  Make sure to read our [step-by-step guide to benchmarking](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/) as well as our Help section on [how to interpret the return index graph](https://help.sharesight.com/interpreting-the-return-index-graph/) to make the most of Sharesight’s benchmarking feature.
