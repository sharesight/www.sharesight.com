:title: Top 20 trades on the NZX in 2019 - Sharesight20
:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only

  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIn this [Sharesight20](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20/)
  yearly trading snapshot we look at the 20 most traded stocks by Sharesight users
  on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) in 2019 and calculate how they performed
  during the year. \n\nLet’s dive into 2019’s top 20 trades.\n\n## Top 20 New Zealand
  Stock Exchange trades in 2019\n\n![Top 20 NZX trades 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/74LG75OQjhBk5TPgFOMhN4/889e60650efc5a4e6be82c0471b01a48/Top20__NZX_trades_2019.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
  Click image to zoom</small>\n\n\nThe Sharesight20 top 20 trades for the NZX in 2019
  shows the dominance of the NZX owned [Smartshares range of ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-smartshares-in-sharesight/)
  as a favoured investment vehicle among Sharesight users to gain exposure to a range
  of asset classes and international opportunities. Of the top 20, Smartshares ETFs
  make up 5 of the top 6 most traded stocks on the exchange, we also see a significant
  bias towards buy trades in these ETFs from investors \"topping up\" the amount invested
  with regular contributions and taking advantage of [dollar cost averaging](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/).\n\n##
  Top 20 NZX trades in 2019 - performance\n\nTo calculate the performance of these
  stocks during 2019 we built a Sharesight portfolio domiciled in the same country
  as the exchange (to remove the impact of currency fluctuations) that contained these
  20 stocks and invested an equally weighted (5% of the total portfolio) amount in
  each stock on January 1st 2019 (or the first listed date for stocks that listed
  after that date).\n\nWe then ran [Sharesight’s Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  to calculate the portfolio’s 2019 performance. Here’s the results, ordered by Total
  Return.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Code</th>\n    <th>Name</th>\n    <th>Capital

  Zealand Electricity generator and retailer Meridian Energy Limited (NZX: MEL) was
  the standout performer in 2019 with returns of 54.94% including a healthy dividend
  yield of 7.88%. Topping Meridian in dividend returns however was fuel retailer and
  distributor Z Energy Limited (NZX: ZEL) with dividends yielding 11.89% - a return
  that softened the blow of the 19.85% collapse in the stock’s price during the year.\n\nOverall
  an equally weighted portfolio of these 20 stocks would have returned 23.89%, which
  would have been outperformed by an ETF tracking the NZX Top 50, such as the Smartshares
  NZ top 50 ETF (NZX: FNZ) which returned 29.05%.\n\n\n## Track your investment portfolio
