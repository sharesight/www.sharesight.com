:title: Sharesight release notes - May 2020
:content: |
  May was another busy month for the product team as we continue to scale out our infrastructure and onboard new staff. A key highlight for the month was rolling out our new and much improved broker file importer UI to around half of our supported brokers. Work on the new importer is continuing at pace and we expect to roll it out more widely over the coming month.
