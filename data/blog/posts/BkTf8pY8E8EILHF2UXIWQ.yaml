  ## Sharesight release highlights for July 2019:

  ### Portfolio Tracker Functionality

  * Improved [Merge Holding](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-merge-holding-feature/) feature to allow for the full packet level cost base history to be maintained across holdings (as opposed to transferring a single cost base figure to the new holding).

  * Interest payments on cash accounts are now included in the [Taxable Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/improved-taxable-income-report-for-australian-investors/).

  * Added a new ‘Interest charged’ transaction type for [manual cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-cash-accounts-in-sharesight/).

  ### Sharesight Usability

  * Significantly improved date picker rolled out to all reports.

  * Optimised instrument search on the Add Holding form for mobile devices.

  * Added ‘In this calendar year' option to the list of predefined date ranges.

  ### Broker Transaction Import

  * Added support for the new format Pattersons Trade Confirmation Emails.

  * Improved support for Jarden Trade Confirmation Emails to cover bonds and international trades.

  * Improved support for Commsec International Trade Confirmation Emails to handle multiple buys and sells on the same document.

  ### News Feeds
