:title: 'New digital banks on the block: What it means for investors'
:content: "Neobanks are all the rage at the moment in Australia. A neobank is a digital
  bank with no legacy systems, which means they don’t borrow or rely on any infrastructure,
  neither physical nor digital, from existing banks. The opportunity to invest in
  a new, digital-focussed bank that promises to shake up Australia’s banking sector
  could be appealing to a lot of investors. Especially with Australia’s biggest banks
  recently taking a hit to their reputation thanks to the Royal Commission.\n\n![featured

  Who are they? Xinja, volt bank and 86 400\n\nDigital banking startup [Xinja](http://s.bl-1.com/h/cmg2C4y1?url=https://www.xinja.com.au/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-OOsjZOl3AIV3gQqCh3ywgQSEAAYASAAEgLshfD_BwE)
  aims to become Australia’s first digital-only bank and launched its prepaid everyday
  spending card and app earlier this year. However, the startup is still waiting on
  its Australian Financial Services License from ASIC and its banking license from
  APRA before it can accept deposits.\n\nThe startup volt bank, which also aims to
  be Australia’s first digital bank, beat Xinja to it when it received Australia’s
  first restricted banking license from APRA in May. The restricted license allows
  volt bank to accept a limited amount in total deposits until the bank receives its
  full banking licence.\n\nThe newest player to enter the competition is [digital
  bank 86 400](http://s.bl-1.com/h/cmg2C8M3?url=https://www.finder.com.au/new-bank-launches-in-australia-to-challenge-the-big-four),
  which was officially announced in June and plans to launch to the market early next
  year. Like Xinja and volt bank, 86 400 will be operated from an app and won’t use
  any legacy systems from existing banks. The startup has an impressive panel of executives
  and is currently completely funded by leading payments provider Cuscal. Like Xinja
  and volt bank, 86 400 is hoping to receive its full banking licence later this year.\n\n##
  What do these new banks mean for investors?\n\nThese new banks present an enticing
  opportunity for investors to buy early. These three startup banks are not yet publicly
  listed; however, they have completed a number of capital raisings allowing investors
  an early piece of the pie.\n\nBy May, volt bank had already raised more than $15.7
  million in capital. In February, Xinja raised more than $2.7 million via equity
  crowdfunding and is about to launch its Series C raise with a target of $20 million.
  86 400 says it’s not currently looking for investors as the funding from Cuscal
  is sufficient, but this may change down the track as the company grows.\n\n## Five
  things for investors to consider\n\nBefore you rush out and buy into any of these
  new banks, it’s important to do your research first. Here are five things to consider:\n
  \ \n1. **Is there consumer demand?** Is there demand from Australian consumers for
  digital banks? Take a look at the amount of customers these banks already have and
  how many people are on their waitlist to get a sense of the potential demand.\n2.
  **Are you making an emotional decision?** These banks are creating a lot of buzz,
  but what do they really offer? Read into these companies to learn what their product
  currently is, what products they will launch and how, what their competitive advantage
  is and how they plan to attract new customers. If you can’t find any of this information,
  it could be a red flag.\n3. **Has there been success in other markets?** Because
  digital banks are a new concept in Australia, no one can say for sure whether they’ll
  be successful here. However, the UK has had a few neobanks in the market for several
  years now. Do some reading into these UK banks to learn how their customer acquisition
  is going and what challenges they’ve faced.\n4. **What are the potential barriers
  to success?** The success of digital banks in Australia has one obvious barrier:
  they need banking licenses to operate. Once these banks have overcome this, consider
  what other challenges they’ll likely face and how this will impact your investment.
  And if they don’t succeed in getting a banking license, will you get your money
  back?    \n5. **Is it fairly valued?** If any of these digital banks list on the
  ASX later down the track, you might be tempted to [buy shares](http://s.bl-1.com/h/cmg2CFm5?url=https://www.finder.com.au/how-to-buy-shares-online).
  Before you do, make sure you crunch the numbers to ensure the company is fairly
  valued. Take a look at the hugely popular micro-investment app Raiz (previously
  Acorns) as an example. There’s been a great deal of excitement around the app, but
  when it listed on the ASX, it saw its share price drop by 50% in just three weeks.\n\nA
  lot of Australians, both customers and investors, are excited by the idea of Australia’s
  Big Four banks finally having some healthy competition. But don’t put your hard-earned
  dollars into any before you’ve done your homework and consider tracking your investment
  using resources such as [Sharesight](/) if you do decide to invest.\n\n![headshot
