:title: mFund from ASX Roadshow
:url_slug: mfund-from-asx-roadshow
:content: "Recently we were invited to present at a roadshow put on by the ASX focussing
  on [mFund](/blog/asx-mfund-now-available-on-sharesight/). The goal was to educate
  DIY investors on mFund in general and highlight the benefits of diversification.\n\n![mFund

  showed off how to track and report on mFunds in Sharesight, whilst a number of well-known
  fund managers talked about their global strategies.\n\n![mFund by ASX - Doug Morris](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3GBfKqfHiocEkSECk8qGsy/53d4d5a4a4c9ff2ff8d4f89dde4c8a64/mFund_hero_min.jpg?w=950)\n\nIf
  you don't know what an [mFund](https://www.asx.com.au/mfund/what-is-an-mfund-product.htm)
  is, you should educate yourself now. We believe take-up will be significant to the
  point of mFund becoming an industry mainstay. \n\nToday there are around 100 funds
  available from high calibre managers such as AMP, Schroders, PIMCO, and Legg Mason.
  This means that via online brokers, such as [CMC Markets](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/learn-share-trading/what-is-an-mfund),
  you can buy and sell managed funds online just as you would a few shares of BHP.
  This is possible. Today.\n\n![mFund by ASX - Doug Morris](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1mzkDe19XauYmoq0SQCyQC/b31ad5d5abfbea4d2d56bbc18980b152/mFund_ecosystem_min.jpg?w=950)\n\nEnter
  [Sharesight](/). As investors add mFund to their portfolios, they need a way to
  administer, track, and report on them. And since mFund by their very nature are
  **not** available on platforms and wraps, Sharesight is the ideal solution.\n\nmFund
  take-up is growing steadily -- we're seeing this first-hand inside Sharesight portfolios.
  This is a major win for DIY investors *and* financial advisers.\n\n![mFund by ASX
  - Doug Morris](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1eadF3RsxI4sCYQYCIAOWm/1c1f9f37df8f361f60e2e578272d9f55/mFund_Doug_3_min.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  DIY investors\nFor retail investors (like me) mFund opens up a whole new world of
  active management. What used to be professional-only ($1M minimum) strategies such
  as fixed interest, emerging markets, infrastructure, and small caps are all now
  just one click away. \n\nYes, ETFs can give you similar exposure, but if you wanted&nbsp;
  **active** management then you had to pay a middleman. For the portfolios on Sharesight,
  we see significant exposures to overseas markets and non-traditional asset classes
  -- but -- a significant portion of that money is sitting in passive structures.\n\nPlus,
  there's virtually no paperwork involved since the units are held by ASX [CHESS](/blog/what-is-chess/).
  I recall first moving to Australia and trying (and failing) to invest a small amount
  of money in a fund online. I was shocked that in the land of compulsory superannuation
  there was no way to buy a fund online!\n\nWe expect mFund (alongside ETFs) to form
  the bedrock of SMSF portfolios.\n\n## Financial advisers\nEvery time we sit down
  with financial planners (usually IFAs), we hear the same two things:\n\nOne, they're
  moving clients off platforms. If the only reason a client's assets are sitting on
  a platform is for on-going admin and reporting, then that client's money is being
  wasted. Advisers know this. So they're searching for alternatives like Sharesight.
  Access to managed funds used to be a valid reason for keeping a client on a platform,
  but with the introduction of mFund + Sharesight that no longer holds true.\n\nTwo,
  they're looking for a flexible advice model. Some clients need end-to-end financial
  advice, some are self-directed but need guidance, and some are totally DIY, save
  for a little bit of \"tuck pointing\" on an annual basis.\n\nSince mFund are available
  to both the adviser and his clients, the adviser is no longer forced to act as the
  asset-gatekeeper. An investment strategy can be driven by the professional, the
  client, or by both. This way the advisers' interests are totally aligned with their
  clients.\n\nAccess to certain asset types and the software used to track portfolios
  used to justify the tolls we had to pay. Fortunately for our bottom lines that's
  begun to change.\n\n![mFund by ASX - Doug Morris](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/65l1CMQSCkSWQYUyIuagEs/93be87d1aa8b16faaf68e9d997c0cb02/mFund_Doug_1_min.jpg?w=950)\n\n*Note:
  ASX will be hosting a similar event for financial advisers in July. Stay tuned to
