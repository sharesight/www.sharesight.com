:title: Sharesight20 top 20 trades in US stocks – May 2021
:content: "Welcome to the May 2021 edition of the Sharesight20USA monthly trading
  snapshot, where we look at Sharesight users’ top 20 trades in US stocks on the Nasdaq,
  NYSE and [NYSE American market](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/)
  (AMEX) over the month. \n\nIn this Sharesight20USA snapshot, buy and sell trades
  were strongly led by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which saw a steep decline in its stock
  price throughout May, particularly following the announcement that the company will
  [no longer accept Bitcoin payments](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57096305).
  The month’s top trades were followed by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has also seen
  its stock price decline in May despite announcing [record-breaking quarterly results](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/)
  at the end of April. Overall, it was a month of losses for some of the big names
  in tech, propelled by inflation fears and a mass crypto sell-off. \n\n## Sharesight20
