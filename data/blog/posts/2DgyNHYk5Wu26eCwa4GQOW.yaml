:title: Sharesight partner profile — Macrovue
:content: "[Macrovue](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/macrovue/) is a new multi-currency
  investment platform that offers over 20,000 stocks and ETFs from 18 different exchanges
  around the world. We differ from traditional brokerages in that we also provide
  fully customisable portfolios of international stocks built around long- term investment
  themes.\n\nWe have partnered with Sharesight to provide [performance and tax reporting
  within the Macrovue platform](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-a-new-partner--macrovue/).
  One of the reasons we have chosen Sharesight as a partner is because of their advanced
  technology which allows us to provide a seamless API connection to their reporting
  smarts within our platform. But the bigger reason is that we have a shared goal
  to empower individual investors to take control of their investment journey.\n\n![Macrovue

  \nToo often, the process of finding good share investments can seem daunting. The
  financial analysis of individual companies requires time, effort, expertise, and
  access to the right data. And a rapidly evolving macro-economic environment complicates
  things further.\n \nThe process gets even more tricky for international investing.
  The companies and regulations are unfamiliar, and data and research is harder to
  come by. Making and managing the investments adds another wrinkle because international
  taxes and reporting means that you are less likely to be your accountant’s favourite
  client.\n \nThat has led most investors to put up their hands and use international
  funds or ETFs. Or invest solely in familiar international brands without regards
  to valuation or growth prospects. However, this approach means that you could be
  missing out on a slew of companies with strong potential for market beating returns.\n
  \nWe created [Macrovue](https://goo.gl/DFEp6J) to help you find these opportunities.
  Our equity analysts with decades of fund management and research experience do the
  hard yards and create portfolios with 10 stocks each. While each portfolio is concentrated
  in a particular theme, choosing 10 stocks mitigates the riskiness of investing in
  a theme with only one stock.\n \nThe themes are setup to take advantage of long
  term structural changes that are affecting the world such as the aging of our society,
  disruptive technologies like the internet of things or autonomous cars, and the
  surging growth in clean technology.  While Australia does have its share of good
  companies, more than 98% of listed companies are trading on international exchanges.\n
  \nOur portfolios are also fully transparent and customisable. You may disagree with
  our stock picks so you are free to remove stocks from the portfolios.  We provide
  all the research so you can learn about perhaps picking the next theme and investment
  opportunity yourself.\n \nSharesight has helped us complete our offering. It allows
  our clients to make investments with full control and transparency and simplify
  the administration of their portfolios. We are looking forward to working together
  to deliver superior outcomes for individual investors.\n\nTo find out more about
