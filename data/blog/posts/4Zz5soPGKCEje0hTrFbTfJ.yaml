:title: Connect your Hatch account directly to Sharesight's portfolio tracker
:url_slug: investors-can-now-sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-hatch
:content: "Investors who trade with [Hatch](https://www.hatchinvest.nz/) in New Zealand
  can now take advantage of Sharesight’s award-winning performance and tax reporting
  simply by connecting their Hatch account to Sharesight. Once connected, Sharesight
  can sync your historic and ongoing Hatch trades, automatically calculating your
  portfolio performance as new trades are added, as well as the impact of foreign
  exchange movements, dividends, capital gains and corporate actions on your investment
  returns. To learn more about how New Zealand investors can benefit from connecting
  their Hatch account to Sharesight, keep reading. \n\n![Connect from Hatch directly
  to Sharesight-s portfolio tracker](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7JAyNiQ1a0kyTnCZghXHyP/dae60ae6d78af41870a13c92451ac3b3/Connect_from_Hatch_directly_to_Sharesight-s_portfolio_tracker.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is Hatch?\n\n[Hatch](https://www.hatchinvest.nz/) is a digital broker that exists
  entirely to help Kiwis put their money to work. The platform gives novices and experts
  alike access to world class investments through a smart, curated investing experience.
  Created by Kiwi Wealth (Kiwibank’s sister company) in 2018, Hatch allows Kiwis to
  buy and sell full and fractional shares and ETFs listed on the New York Stock Exchange
  and Nasdaq – markets which [Sharesight also supports](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/).
  \n\n## Why you should connect your Hatch account to Sharesight\n\nBy importing your
  [Hatch](https://www.hatchinvest.nz/) trades to Sharesight (along with the rest of
  your investments), you can easily track your investment performance across different
  brokers, asset classes and [over 40 global markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/),
  including the __NZX__, __ASX__, __NYSE__ and __NASDAQ__. Investors also gain access
  to Sharesight’s advanced performance and tax reporting designed for the needs of
  self-directed investors.\n\nSharesight offers a range of powerful reports for investors
  including Performance, Portfolio Diversity, Contribution Analysis, Multi-Period,
  Multi-Currency Valuation and Future Income (upcoming announced dividends). The ability
  to track cash accounts, property and [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio.\n\n### Track your dividend income\nUnlike other portfolio
  trackers, Sharesight automatically tracks [dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  (including [dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/))
  and takes this into account when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make a significant contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the value of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more than
  just capital gains in its performance calculations.\n\n![NYSE dividend stock Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/32cONC98vp9VYwug34ngxw/36a9f45158c66f2579b4ea4a30679659/NYSE_dividend_stock_Sharesight.JPG)\n\n##
  How to connect your Hatch account to Sharesight\nInvestors trading through Hatch
  can easily [establish a secure connection](https://help.sharesight.com/hatch/) between
  their Hatch and Sharesight accounts, which will automatically import historical
  and ongoing trades into their portfolio. Investors who choose not to link their
  Hatch and Sharesight accounts can also use Sharesight's [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature to automatically capture historical and ongoing trades. Keep reading to
  learn more.\n\n### Connect your Hatch account directly to Sharesight\nIt's easy
  to connect your Hatch account to Sharesight through the powerful [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).

  up for a free account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup).\n\nOnce signed
  up, select 'Import from a Broker' on the ‘Let’s get you started with Sharesight’
  page and follow the instructions on the [help page](https://help.sharesight.com/hatch/)
  to import your trades.\n\n__Note: Hatch’s integration with the Sharesight API means
  none of your Hatch account details will be visible to Sharesight, and your trading
  data is downloaded through a secure connection. You can revoke the connection to
  Sharesight at any time.__\n\n### Need more help syncing your Hatch trades to Sharesight?\n\nIn
