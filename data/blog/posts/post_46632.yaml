:title: What we learned when recruiting for our fintech

:content: "Finding quality people to join start-ups and small tech companies is a
  challenge. This is especially true in Australia, which is dominated by a few large
  institutions who seem to be endlessly padding their existing business lines and
  hiring for “special projects.” Furthermore, the local university system steers students
  into rigid disciplines. Online businesses don’t typically offer roles that match
  these disciplines exactly. \n\nWe’ve noticed a change recently, however, as we’ve
  increased our headcount. In Sydney, we’ve hired a Customer Service Manager and an
  Account Manager. Over in Wellington we’re onboarding a Project Manager next month.\n\n![Fintech

  the two Sydney-based roles we received 150 applications. I was struck by the number,
  quality, and diversity of CVs – a major step up from when we hired people last year.
  I took this as an indication that perhaps the [Sharesight](/) brand is becoming
  recognised in the market, but more likely than that: **people are now open to joining
  a fintech company.**\n\n### Breakdown of applicant industries for two recent job
  openings at [Sharesight](/)\n\n![Breakdown of applicant's current industries for

  full 25% of our applicants, including the Account Manager we hired, came from the
  big banks.**\n\n**10% came from well-known technology companies.**\n\nThe remaining
  applicants came from an array of professional services firms, industrial companies,
  telecoms, etc.\n\nThe background of candidates that we consider is obviously important.
  Understanding financial services, portfolio management, accounting, etc. are all
  pluses. But being too tied to these disciplines can also be a negative. Ours is
  a company where we can’t afford to NOT have our people colour outside the lines
  of their official job descriptions.\n\nSo what do we look for when recruiting for
  our fintech? We put more stock in the adaptability of candidates and the willingness
  to learn an entirely new business model. What we’re doing at Sharesight is novel
  and we need our people to wear many hats and get involved with all phases of our
  business."
