:title: Is Sharesight in Cloud cuckoo land?
:url_slug: is-sharesight-in-cloud-cuckoo-land
:content: "No we are not!\n\nWe are all down-to-earth characters here at [Sharesight](/)
  and definitely not in cloud cuckoo land – but we are [In the Cloud](/blog/how-does-sharesight-operate-in-the-cloud/).\n\nWe
  have encountered a lot of confusion from our customers about what being ‘In the
  Cloud’ means. Some ask us questions like ‘how do I transfer Sharesight onto my new
  computer’? Or ‘my computer is stuffed – does that mean all my Sharesight data is
  lost’?\n\nMost of you know more about cloud computing than this of course but we
  do encounter a lot of people who are worried by exaggerated stories about the risks
  of Cloud Computing.\n\nThis is the first in a series of articles that will look
  at Cloud Computing. My aim is to keep it really simple to help our customers who
  do not have a good handle on Cloud Computing. I will look at:\n\n1. What is Cloud
  Computing?\n2. [How Sharesight operates in the cloud](/blog/how-does-sharesight-operate-in-the-cloud/)\n3.
  How do you benefit as a Sharesight customer?\n4. How Cloud based services can join
  forces to offer you benefits you have never dreamed of\n5. Finally I’ll look at
  perceived disadvantages of The Cloud and set your minds at rest.\n\nSo let’s get
  started.\n\n### What is Cloud Computing?\nThis is a big topic so to keep things
  manageable I will just focus what matters to you as an individual Sharesight customer.\n\nBecause
  Sharesight operates ‘In the Cloud’ it means that when you use Sharesight you don’t
  use your computer - you use ours! That is a bit of an exaggeration of course because
  you do have to turn your computer on to use Sharesight. But it doesn’t do much more
  than act as a messenger. Your computer sends a message to Sharesight when you log
  on. Sharesight then sends a copy of all your information to your computer. When
  you log off again nothing is stored on your computer. \n\nThis is why it doesn’t
  matter if your computer packs up. Well, it does of course, but not as far as your
  Sharesight data is concerned. You can use any computer you like, anywhere in the
  world, to see your Sharesight portfolio because all it has to do is be a messenger.\n\nSharesight’s
  servers do all the thousands of calculations that are needed keep your portfolio
  up to date and make sure it is securely stored and backed up.\n\nI’ll tell you a
  bit more about servers in the next article because they play a very important part
  in making sure your data is secure, does not get lost and is available to you when
  you want it.\n\nThe main message that I want to leave you with from this first article
  is that because Sharesight operates in ‘The Cloud’ it can look after all the nuts
  and bolts. This is not another of my exaggerations! I think it is actually an understatement
  because Sharesight in the cloud takes a big weight off your shoulders. You do not
  have to worry about downloading software onto your computer, keeping it up-to-date
  and having a software licence. And you don’t have to worry about viruses, backing
  up data so you don’t lose it or running out of space on your computer.\n\nIn short,
  you are left free to concentrate on the fun part -- getting the best return you
  can from your investments and exploring all the benefits Sharesight offers."
