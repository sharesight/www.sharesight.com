:title: 6 women share their investing journeys
:content: "[Study](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/nov/24/the-truth-about-investing-women-do-it-better-than-men)
  after [study](https://qz.com/work/1386775/study-of-investors-shows-differences-between-men-and-women/)
  shows that women are better investors than men. They tend to take fewer risks and
  are less emotional when it comes to long term investing. Despite this, most investing
  is still done by men. For example, here at [Sharesight](/), women make up only roughly
  11% of our user base. And despite the number of women investing online doubling
  over the last 5 years, they still only represent [a fifth of Australian online investors](https://www.investordaily.com.au/markets/44563-more-women-investing-online-but-gender-gap-persists).
  This leaves the majority of women financially unstable and [unprepared for retirement](https://www.firstlinks.com.au/women-unprepared-retirement/).\n\nThe
  more people share their investing stories, the more approachable it becomes. So
  with that in mind, here are the stories of 6 women who openly shared their investing
  journeys and strategies with me. Some were lucky enough to learn investing from
  their parents, others learned it at work, and others figured it out entirely on
  their own. Read on to learn how they all did it:\n\n![featured - 6 women share their

  Rikki-Ann -- Australia\n\n#### *How long have you been investing?*\n\nI have been
  investing for the last 20 years.\n\n#### *What do you invest in?*\n\nOriginally
  I started investing when we had to relocate towns and we kept our home as a rental
  property. We then went on the build a portfolio of rental properties (17 in total)
  after reading the *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* book. When I stopped working to look after
  my children I started to invest in the share market. In recent years we have sold
  our rental property portfolio and invest solely in the share market.\n\n#### *What
  does your asset mix look like?*\n\nMy asset mix is 100% equity. I have diversified
  into the 10 different sectors of the market and I have 7.5% of my portfolio in property
  REIT/shares (rather than owning property directly).\n\n#### *Do you diversify your
  investments globally, or do you tend to stay within your home country?*\n\nI started
  investing while living in New Zealand so I have about 55% of my portfolio in New
  Zealand shares. I have increased my international holding by purchasing shares in
  companies that have a global presence and by purchasing international ETF.\n\n####
  *Do you purchase your shares directly and/or via a financial advisor or robo-advisor?*\n\nI
  purchase all shares directly. I manage both mine and my husbands portfolio. My main
  goal is to achieve cash flow (dividends) rather than capital gains. I have a buy
  and hold strategy so I do not sell often. I have a high risk tolerance and so over
  half of my returns has come from capital gains even though several of the shares
  I purchased have since liquidated. I have a plan for my portfolios and I review
  this annually.\n\n#### *How do you keep track of your investments?*\n\nIn the beginning
  I used Excel to keep track of my investments. I now use Sharesight to keep track
  of my shares and future dividend/distributions and tax obligations.\n\n#### *How
  did you learn about investing?*\n\nI first learnt about investing from reading books
  and searching the internet for information on how to build a portfolio and information
  on different shares. I used the research that my broker provides as a guide on when
  to purchase. Initially I started with small investments and learnt through trial
  and error.\n\n#### *Can you share one thing you wish you’d known when you started
  investing?*\n\nNever be afraid to accept a loss, I should have sold the companies
  that liquidated earlier.\n\n#### *Is there anything else you’d like to share about
  your investing journey?*\n\nAll investment carries some degree of risk. Every share
  I own has a some point in time been worth less than I paid for it. When selecting
  shares I usually purchase companies where I shop. For example the utility company
  I hold is the company I purchase my electricity/gas from.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n![Ruth
  Henderson (The Happy Saver)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3EEdNljqyxNeNu9VmBkTnt/bc722dd1fe62e8de04b96957c3da20e5/Ruth-Henderson.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Ruth -- New Zealand\n**Blogger, [The Happy Saver](https://www.thehappysaver.com)**\n\n####
  *How long have you been investing?*\n\nProbably about 13 years now. My husband and
  I paid off our house when I was 32 and he was 33 and then money started accumulating
  in our account, so we started to look for places to put it. So, I started to research
  options and have been hooked on investing ever since.\n\n#### *What do you invest
  in?*\n\nI’m invested in property, my own home. And one is enough for me!\n\nI’m
  also investing in a growth [KiwiSaver](https://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz) fund (Simplicity)
  via my wages and through voluntary contributions (and have been since day one).\n\nI
  also invest in three [Smartshares](https://smartshares.co.nz) funds, US500, NZ Top
  50 and the NZ Property Fund. I also hold Meridian shares, my only individual shares,
  which I bought at the very beginning when the government partially privatised the
  company. Plus for a bit of fun, I bought gold, pretty to look at but a bit naff
  as far as an investment goes! My husband could not resist and he bought some Bitcoin
  and has been enjoying the wild ride ever since.\n\nI tried many things as a way
  to educate myself. I either stuck with that investment or cashed it out and tried
  the next thing before finally settling into a long term investment strategy once
  I worked out that chopping and changing does not create wealth.\n\n#### *What does
  your asset mix look like?*\n\nOur house takes up too big a chunk in my opinion,
  about 70%, but it’s hard to avoid that given the price of housing in New Zealand
  and with every investment, I’m working to reduce this percentage. There is about
  25% in equities (I’m growing this each month) and maybe 5% in cash.\n\n#### *Do
  you own individual shares and/or ETFs/managed funds?*\n\nThe only individual shares
  I own are Meridian and have no plans to purchase any more. Through learning about
  investing I came to realise I don’t have the interest or the time to meticulously
  research individual companies in order to make a sound investment plus I also came
  to understand that those who do have the time and inclination are often not that
  great at picking individual companies either! I would much rather direct my money
  into ETFs and let the individual companies within those ETFs get on with making
  the right investment decisions for their businesses. And as I often say, I’d rather
  be out running in the hills with my dog that researching the share market!\n\n####
  *Do you purchase your shares directly and/or via a financial advisor or robo-advisor?*\n\nI
  purchase directly and don’t use a financial advisor.\n\n#### *How do you keep track
  of your investments?*\n\nI developed my own spreadsheet many years ago and I still
  keep that up to date, just in a very simple way by noting down my balances at the
  end of each month and tracking my earnings, investments, expenses and net worth.
  I then discovered Sharesight and I use it to track all of my investments now as
  their math is a lot better than my own! I also use PocketSmith to track my incomings
  and outgoings.\n\n#### *How did you learn about investing?*\n\nAbsolutely self-taught
  after being unable to find any credible and legible advice aimed at me. When I did
  make approaches to professionals I felt marketed to and patronised so I struck out
  on my own and discovered the incredibly helpful global personal financial community.
  It is full of intelligent and helpful people willing to answer any question and
  to encourage you to just keep things simple and not jump at every new investment
  opportunity that walks in the door. Slow and steady wins the race would be my advice.\n\n####
  *Can you share one thing you wish you’d known when you started investing?*\n\nThat
  the vast majority of investments products are just business trying to make money
  -- out of YOU. There are a thousand investments to choose from and you would do
  well to avoid pretty much all of them. Live on way less than you make and invest
  every single month from a young age and forget about keeping up with the Joneses,
  a lot of them are broke anyway! Find a strong female role model who is killing it
  financially and offer to take her out for a glass of wine and ask her what she is
  doing to be successful.\n\n#### *Is there anything else you’d like to share about
  your investing journey?*\n\nI don’t invest to become rich and greedy, I invest to
  provide myself and my family with peace of mind. That is what money does, it just
  takes pressure off you and lets you enjoy your life because you simply don’t have
  to work so much. Frugality = Freedom. If ever I suffer from FOMO because I don’t
  have the latest phone I just reflect on the fact that to have all that stuff I will
  need to trade my time for money. And going back to a comment I made earlier, I would
  far rather be out running with my dog and hanging with my family than working 9-5.
  When it comes to money invested, you need far less to live a great life than you
  realise! Live on less than you make, invest as much as you can and treat every $50
  you spend like an hour of your life that you are never going to get back!\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n\n\n##
  Selina -- UK\n\n#### *How long have you been investing?*\n\nI have always had shares
  (my mum purchased them for me when I was little as it’s something she was interested
  in) but I have been properly investing for about 2 years.\n\n#### *What does your
  asset mix look like?*\n\nIf you ignore my house it’s all equities now.\n\n#### *Do
  you diversify your investments globally, or do you tend to stay within your home
  country?*\n\nI only purchase on the LSE but a lof the companies I invest in are
  global players.\n\n#### *Do you purchase your equities directly and/or via a financial
  advisor or robo-advisor?*\n\nDefinitely directly -- that’s part of the fun of investing!\n\n####
  *How do you keep track of your investments?*\n\nI used to use the Google Finance
  portfolio feature when it was around but swapped to Sharesight when they shut it
  down. It’s as easy to use but gives a much better representation of your returns.\n\n####
  *How did you learn about investing?*\n\nIt’s a real mixture but the biggest learning
  has come from the internet and books I have read. \n\n#### *Can you share one thing
  you wish you’d known when you started investing?*\n\nHow hard it is to take emotions
  out of it! I knew I had to but didn’t realise how difficult it would be for me.\n\n####
  *Is there anything else you’d like to share about your investing journey?*\n\nOnly
  take the plunge if you’re prepared to do your research, if you’re not prepared to
  do it then you might as well gamble your money away at the bookies!\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n\n\n![Erika
  Jonsson (Six Park)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6g0c5CxpDfCDYtFQ53tqLs/879febd3ded8eae00fecd0cd0b528730/Erika-Jonsson.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Erika -- Australia\n**Head of Communication, [Six Park](https://www.sixpark.com.au)**\n\n####
  *How long have you been investing?*\n\nI’ve been investing for a bit over 18 months;
  aside from buying a home it was my first investment outside superannuation. I found
  the whole process of becoming an investor transformative -- I’d always had a view
  of investing being really risky without exception, so learning about different kinds
  of risk and how to control the controllables has been quite empowering.\n\n####
  *What do you invest in?*\n\nI have a balanced-growth portfolio of exchange-traded
  funds with [Six Park](https://www.sixpark.com.au) and I’ve recently started using
  the round-ups feature on Raiz to build some extra savings without feeling a big
  impact. I plan to transfer the money from Raiz into my Six Park account every few
  months. My husband and I are also paying off our home.\n\n#### *Do you diversify
  your investments globally, or do you tend to stay within your home country?*\n\nMy
  portfolio is a mixture of Australian and global investments -- I hold ETFs that
  represent Australian and international shares, emerging markets, global property,
  global infrastructure and Australian bonds. The importance of diversification is
  definitely one of the key messages that Six Park reinforces consistently.\n\n####
  *How do you keep track of your investments?*\n\nI monitor both of my portfolios
  online, usually on my mobile. I don’t check either of them too often as it would
  be really easy to worry when markets are volatile or have a bad day if I was thinking
  about my investments all the time. I think about my Six Park investment in particular
  as being similar to my super -- I see it as a long-term investment that I can best
  serve by being patient and contributing regularly.\n\n#### *How did you learn about
  investing?*\n\nUntil I started working casually at Six Park, I had very little understanding
  of investing or the principles that serve successful investors well. My parents
  taught me about compound interest and the importance of saving, but they were quite
  conservative about shares and investments outside property because it wasn’t something
  they had a lot of experience with. My investing confidence and experience has grown
  during my time with Six Park, and I now love sharing knowledge with other investors,
  both new and experienced. There are so many different ways to invest, but I believe
  understanding the foundations and your own disposition toward risk and reward will
  always serve you well. Knowing a bit about behavioural economics and how our biases
  affect us as investors is also really helpful!\n\n#### *Can you share one thing
  you wish you’d known when you started investing?*\n\nI don’t have regrets as an
  investor, but I do wish that I’d had the confidence to start sooner. Time is such
  an important ally when it comes to making the most of your money and investments.
  I always felt that because I was saving I was doing everything I could do to grow
  my wealth, but actually saving is just the first part of it. I now have a lot of
  different kinds of saving happening! My other advice would be to read -- or listen
  --  widely because knowledge breeds confidence, which is critical to overcoming
  our status quo bias and our fear of the unknown.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n\n\n![featured

  Emily -- Australia (via Canada)\n**Analytical Marketing Manager, Sharesight**\n\n####
  *How long have you been investing?*\n\nI’ve been investing for two years.\n\n####
  *What do you invest in?*\n\n100% equities (all ETFs).\n\n#### *Do you diversify
  your investments globally, or do you tend to stay within your home country?*\n\nI
  have global exposure through my ETFs.\n\n#### *Do you purchase them directly and/or
  via a financial advisor or robo-advisor?*\n\nI purchased them directly through my
  online broker.\n\n#### *How do you keep track of your investments?*\n\nI use Sharesight
  to keep track of my overall performance and help me at tax time, but I also use
  the Yahoo! Finance widget on my mobile to track daily price movements. \n\n####
  *How did you learn about investing?*\n\nI learned quite a bit about investing in
  my finance classes in university, but it wasn’t until I started working at Sharesight
  that I was surrounded by people who could give me practical, local information.
  For example, I learned what ETFs were, what to consider when choosing an online
  broker, and how to properly track performance.\n\n#### *Can you share one thing
  you wish you’d known when you started investing*\n\nTo choose your broker wisely.
  I went with the cheapest broker I could find because I wanted to make sure that
  my brokerage fees wouldn’t eat away at my returns, especially since I wasn’t investing
  a great amount of money. Soon after making my investment, I found out that I don’t
  actually own the ETF I invested in, but rather a custodian. I also learned that
  they introduced a quarterly fee if you don’t trade enough, and this quarterly fee
  would end up costing me more than going with one of the most expensive brokers.
  Fortunately I had no issues transferring my holdings to a different broker, and
  I didn’t lose any history because I keep all my investing history within Sharesight.
  Definitely read reviews before selecting your broker.\n\n#### *Is there anything
  else you’d like to share about your investing journey?*\n\nI have found it a bit
  daunting to get started on my investing journey, but now I find it exciting and
  almost addictive. You’re not meant to worry too much about the short term, but I
  find myself checking on my investments multiple times a day.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n\n\n##
  Nicola -- Australia (via the UK)\n\n#### *How long have you been investing?*\n\nI’ve
  been investing for 3 years.\n\n#### *What do you invest in?*\n\nOutside of my Australian
  Super, I invest 100% in property.\n\n#### *Do you diversify your investments globally,
  or do you tend to stay within your home country*\n\nGlobally. I currently have one
  property in the UK and in the process of one in Australia and Spain.\n\n#### *How
  did you learn about investing?*\n\nI learned about property investing from my parents
  and doing research on the internet.\n\n#### *Can you share one thing you wish you’d
  known when you started investing?*\n\nIt's a long and slow process and patience
  is key! \n\n#### *Is there anything else you’d like to share about your investing
  journey?*\n\nIf something isn't sitting well with you, always get a second opinion.
  It’s ok to ask people to explain jargon or processes to you repeatedly until you
  understand them. If you can't explain it to a 6 year old, you don't understand it!\n\n####
  *Why have you decided to invest 100% in property as opposed to the stock market?*\n\nI
  have always been taught that property is a longer investment and less risk. Also,
  I have no idea or knowledge about the stock market.\n\n## Write your own investing
  story\n\nI hope you enjoyed learning from these investors as much as I did. These
  are my takeaways:\n\n- **If you’re not already investing, start now** -- Don’t let
  a “late start” stop you from investing later in life. Yes, compound interest and
  time make a huge difference in the long term, but starting today is still better
  than 10 years from now (or never).<br><br>\n\n- **Learn from others** -- If you
  know someone who invests, ask them how they do it. Chances are, they’ll be more
  than happy to show you. And stay tuned for a follow-up article where we share the
  investing books, blogs, and podcasts recommended by the women featured in this article.<br><br>\n\n-
  **If you’re already investing, pay it forward by sharing your knowledge** -- Especially
  with the young people in your life. It could be the most important gift you ever
  give them!\n\n## Start your investing journey with Sharesight\nThe best way to understand
