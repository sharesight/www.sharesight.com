:title: CMC Markets Stockbroking Pro Platform Launch
:url_slug: cmc-pro-platform-launch
:content: "We were lucky to be invited to the [CMC Markets Stockbroking Pro Platform](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/platform/stockbroking-pro-platform)
  event launch last night. Held on the top-level of the Museum of Contemporary Art
  and overlooking Sydney's iconic harbour, it was the perfect setting to reveal Australia's
  next generation share trading platform.\n\n![CMC Markets Stockbroking Pro Platform
  Launch - Featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/12KOOhacGkuMo6YiQ0ks4O/71e0b8271fe2843251f4b28d99b15e7a/featured_cmc-pro-platform.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  Andy Rogers, Director of Stockbroking explained, the new Pro Platform is Australia's
  first HTML5 trading platform. This is a big deal because it leverages cutting-edge
  technology that is lightning-fast and doesn't require any special plugins to run.
  (If you've ever suffered through the latest Flash installation, you'll appreciate
  what we're talking about.)\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p

  15, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
  charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nBeing a tech company, we know how stressful it can
  be to perform a live demo, but Head of Product Development Ryan O'Doherty pulled
  it off without a hitch. He showcased the power of the HTML5-driven platform by demonstrating
  how easy it is group, resize, and drag & drop content to suit your particular trading
  needs. With 95 technical indicators and 35 drawing tools, this is the first time
  this level of charting power has been available for Australian retail traders. And
  with close to 100 possible customizations, the new Pro Platform makes it quick and
  easy to monitor the market. Add to that embedded investing research from [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com.au),
  [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com) and [theScreener](https://www.thescreener.com)
  and you've got a very powerful trading platform, which as _The Australian_ put it,
  will help investors to \"[sort the signal from the noise](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/how-investors-can-sort-the-signal-from-the-noise/story-fnxh7ky6-1227571163729)\".

  Head of Product Development Ryan O'Doherty, demonstrating the new CMC Pro Platform</small>\n\nTypical
  brokers outsource their development so it's refreshing to see CMC Markets Stockbroking
  doing their own development and building such a cutting-edge trading platform for
  the Australian market. From our perspective, we were blown away by its speed, as
  historical graphs were loaded and resized at the blink of an eye. We were also impressed
  to learn that it runs on no less than 28 APIs! That's exactly the kind of connected
  ecosystem that many (including [Malcolm Turnbull](/blog/malcolm-turnbull-uttered-words-open-api/))
  believe to be the key to future growth and innovation - not just in fintech but
  for all tech-based industries. Speaking of tech, it was pretty neat to see the Pro
  Platform stations throughout the space, which allowed investors to have a play with
  the new platform right then and there:\n\n![CMC Pro Platform Launch](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5ywoKGpHsAqGWwiEGaCEGA/7b6cdd466b8bd25502d83f6427c7c8d6/cmc-pro-platform-launch-1.jpg?w=950)\n<small>Testing-out
  the new CMC Pro Platform</small>\n\nWe love CMC Markets Stockbroking. Like [Sharesight](/),
  they're focused on providing an innovative service at a fair price. They were [our
  first brokerage partner](/blog/sharesight-teams-up-with-cmc-markets-stockbroking/)
  and we continue to be great mates today. And while our Trade Confirmation Emails
  forwarding feature is nice, our [API connection](https://help.sharesight.com/sharesight_connect/)
  is what really sets our partnership apart. That's because when you trade with CMC
  Markets Stockbroking, your trades are automatically sent to Sharesight within seconds.
  All CMC Markets Stockbroking clients can leverage this feature, but Premium Traders
  (who place at least 30 trades per month) have the added bonus of [getting a Sharesight
  Investor plan for no cost](/blog/a-new-partnership-with-cmc-markets/), meaning they
  can access to up to three portfolios with unlimited holdings and trades on Sharesight
  as part of their CMC Markets Stockbroking package. If cutting-edge technology and
  low-cost trading & tracking is important to you, then we highly recommend checking
  them out.\n\nFor more information, visit the [CMC Markets Stockbroking](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/stockbroking)
  and [CMC Markets Stockbroking Pro Platform](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/platform/stockbroking-pro-platform)
  webpages.\n\n**Thanks to CMC Markets Stockbroking for inviting us along to the launch
  of their innovative Pro Platform!**\n\n![CMC Pro Platform Launch](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6yaK2wk2M8kYqse2KocGgu/5ce1f6d048f03edbb570b7e958255e30/cmc-pro-platform-launch-2_resized.jpg?w=950)\n<small>Sharesight's
