:content: "It’s been an exciting few days for the team at Sharesight, having had the
  opportunity to attend the [Australian Shareholders' Association](https://www.australianshareholders.com.au/)’s
  2021 Investor conference. The theme of this year’s event was ‘how to become a better
  investor’ – a topic very fitting for Sharesight. Some of the highlights for us include
  the opportunity for our [Chief Marketing Officer, Prashant Mohan](https://www.sharesight.com/team/),
  to give a demo of Sharesight, as well as our [CEO Doug Morris](https://www.sharesight.com/team/)’s
  talk on the seven habits of successful investors. There were also plenty of great
  conversations at our event booth, with lots of investors wondering how they can
  get started tracking their investments with Sharesight. \n\n![Sharesight at ASA

  Investors visiting the Sharesight booth at the 2021 ASA Investor Conference. </small>\n\nWe
  would like to thank the ASA for a fantastic event, and for those who could not attend,
  here is a snapshot of some of the best talks that we think can help you to become
  a better investor. \n\n## Seven habits of successful investors\n\nSharesight CEO
  Doug Morris presents some of the most important habits of successful investors based
  on his personal experience.\n\n1. **Invest in what you understand and love**, not
  just what you think you should be investing in. This makes it much easier to stay
  informed on the companies in your portfolio. \n\n2. **Understand your true performance**.
  Don’t look to your broker to get an understanding of your performance. Unlike Sharesight,
  brokers don’t take into account dividend performance, foreign exchange rates, corporate
  actions and other factors that affect the cost base of your portfolio. They also
  do not provide money-weighted annualised return figures. \n\n3. **Understand who
  profits from whom.** Brokers are focused on execution, while asset managers tend
  to focus on third-party distribution networks to sell investments. Share registries
  are also focused on their role as custodians of dividend information, while advisors
  tend to rely on expensive platforms. The investor ends up in the middle of all of
  this. Sharesight’s portfolio management software brings all of these market participants
  together through an advanced API that creates a seamless ecosystem for self-directed
  investors. \n\n4. **Asset allocation matters.** Your asset allocation determines
  50% of your returns, while the other 50% comes from active management. Consider
  your asset allocation carefully as you are nearing retirement. For example, you
  may choose to lower your exposure to small stocks due to their tendency towards
  volatility. \n\n5. **Benchmark yourself.** Consider your benchmark as a realistic
  alternative strategy if your investment portfolio is not performing well. \n\n6.
  **The only guaranteed outcome in investing is the fees you will pay to do it.**
  There are a lot of interesting new lost-cost brokers entering the market, but be
  aware of the tradeoff you will have to make with these brokers. Eg. Will you actually
  own your shares? Also consider the compounding effect of brokerage fees over time
  and how this impacts your investment portfolio. \n\n7. **Make a mistake and learn
  from it.** Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Ideally however, they will be (relatively)
  inexpensive mistakes that you make early on and never repeat again.  \n\n![Doug

  </small>\n\n## Behavioural economics and investing \n\nAnthony Doyle, an Investment
  Specialist from Fidelity International explains how understanding behavioural economics
  and the biases we have as investors is crucial to avoiding asset bubbles. He cites
  Bitcoin, the Nasdaq and Australian housing as some of the potential bubbles of today,
  for instance. \n\nHere are some of the key biases investors should avoid: \n\n*
  **Confirmation bias:** We tend to seek views that are similar to our own. Avoid
  this by considering scenarios that differ from your thesis and evaluate investments
  based on first principles. \n\n* **Highsight bias:** We tend to think we made better
  investment decisions than we actually did. Be wary of linear explanations and always
  conduct forward-looking research. \n\n* **Representativeness:** Sometimes we make
  judgements that are statistically unlikely due to stereotypes. For example, investors
  can wrongly assume a company is ‘hot’ due to its sector or expect good companies
  to stay good and bad companies to stay bad. Avoid this by making decisions based
  on data and doing stock-specific research. \n\n* **Overconfidence:** Beware of becoming
  overconfident in periods of stability.\n\n* **Herding:** There is a tendency for
  investors to want to do what everyone else is doing. In some cases it can be beneficial
  to move with a crowd, however crowds can also have biases and make assets move far
  from their intrinsic value. The best strategy is to be a contrarian. Use valuation
  metrics and if you’re looking for diversification, consider targeting value stocks,
  which often move differently to the broader market. \n\n* **Loss aversion:** Due
  to their fear of losses, investors often sell winners too quickly and hold onto
  losers for too long. Avoid this by reviewing your investments from first principles
  as if you don’t own them, and stick to a consistent investing strategy despite market
  trends. \n\n## Building low-cost diversified portfolios \n\nDavid Bassanese, Chief
  Economist at BetaShares explains how investors can approach building a diversified
  balanced portfolio using BetaShares ETF products as examples. \n\nThe importance
  of diverse asset classes: \n\n* Each different asset class will reflect different
  risk and return characteristics, and will perform differently in different market
  conditions. Investors should find a **risk-return profile** that fits their age,
  temperament and where we are in the business cycle. \n\n* Think of **asset allocation**
  like \"blending wine\". Blending two wines with different characteristics can allow
  a broader range of wine styles. \n\n* An investing example: Investing in two businesses
  that do well at different times of the year can smooth out overall revenues over
  the year. \n\n* It’s important to choose your preferred level of risk. There are
  two opposite sides of the spectrum: **high-risk assets** and **low-risk assets**.
  To create a balanced portfolio, you should vary weights between both sides of the
  spectrum. \n\n* It’s possible to build a balanced portfolio by purchasing exchange-traded
  products (ETPs) such as ETFs. For example, you could create a balanced, diversified
  portfolio by dividing your investments into cash, floating-rate bonds, fixed-rate
  government and corporate bonds, hybrids, property/real assets, local and international
  equities and commodities. \n\n* The percentage breakdown might be 40% cash/bonds/hybrids,
  50% equities/property and 5% gold, for instance. \n\n## Become a better investor
