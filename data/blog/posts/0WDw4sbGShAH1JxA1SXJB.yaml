:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not

  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIs there a case for investing in Asia?
  The answers were revealed during an event hosted by [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/)
  in association with [Aberdeen Standard Investments](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/five-paths-to-investment-diversification/)
  last night in Sydney. \n\nAt the event, Sharesight CEO Doug Morris discussed the
  role geography plays in market [diversification](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/five-paths-to-investment-diversification/)
  and Aberdeen’s Head of Investment Specialists (Asia) Don Amstad made the case for
  Asia as a geographic diversification play.\n\nAttendees gained an understanding
  of the importance of [asset allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/)
  choices in an investment portfolio and the role historic events and culture have
  played to shape Asian economies, and the opportunities this presents for investors
  in the region.\n\n\n![Sharesight Investing in Asia](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/62aV81GsRrgMdzTzAMjTPo/a47002e2f23d647f7b3b58a82941f3ee/Sharesight_Investing_in_Asia.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Key takeaways\n\n### Asset allocation and market exposure to geographic diversification\n\nDoug’s
  talk centred on the need for investors to look outside their home markets for opportunities,
  with real world data on the exposure of Sharesight user portfolios to exchanges
  outside their home markets.\n\nInvestment return thinking has evolved over time:\n\n*
  1986: \"90% of investment return is determined by asset allocation\" (Brinson, Singer,
  Beebower)\n\n* 2010: \"80% of return variation is determined by **market movement**...
  and **active management** has about the same impact on performance as a specific
  asset allocation policy\" (Ibbotson)\n\nInvestors (in Australia) using Sharesight
  are increasingly diversified geographically: \n\n* 2008  - 94% of on investment
  holdings are ASX listed vs International\n\n* 2018 - 81% of investment holdings
  are ASX listed vs international\n\nWhere revenue is earned by listed companies varies
  significantly by exchange in the [major market indexes](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/):\n\n*
  Companies in France’s CAC 40, Germany’s FSE DAX and UK’s’ FTSE 100 give local investors
  the most exposure to revenue earned in international markets \n\n* Australia’s ASX
  200 and the USA’s S&P 500 are not geographically diverse by comparison\n\n* In particular,
  overseas revenue earned by ASX 200 listed companies is mostly attributable to the
  39 resource companies in the index - which carries sector concentration risk \n\n![Market
  exposure to international revnues](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4B2kKirvs1epuIl3ghVV4L/9cfb27130d3ebe0df3f49ce2b48cefd9/Market_exposure_to_international_revnues.png?w=950)\n\n###
  The case for asia & the opening of China’s capital markets  \n\nDon has been giving
  versions of this talk for a decade.. And believes it is now more true than ever.\n\nEconomic
  and population growth:\n\n* Urbanisation is the key driver behind returns in China
  and across Asia\n\n* Life expectancy is up significantly across Asia, with the biggest
  shift being China, with life expectancy more than doubling from 36 in 1960 to 76
  years today\n\n* Alongside this has been significant growth in GDP per capita, most
  concentrated in the big cities\n\n* Which has ballooned the size of the middle class
  and an increasing culture of consumerism\n\nChina’s demographic problem:\n\n* As
  the population ages, there is forecast to be a halving of the number of workers
  per retiree by 2050\n\n* Government lead focus on the quality of work / productivity
  to support this\n\n* This means there will be a shift in the savings pool from purely
  investing in growth to smarter asset allocation\n\n* While it is rapidly evolving,
  China doesn’t have the same credit/equity investing culture of other markets\n\n*
  China is attempting to ‘import’ the investing culture from other markets by opening
  up Chinese stock/bond markets to investors worldwide\n\n* This could be a massive
  opportunity for investors to find underpriced stocks before they reach ‘fair’ value\n\nChinese
  market inclusion in [major indexes](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/):
  \n\n* Included in SDR in 2016\n\n* MSCI began to include A shares in May 2018\n\n*
  Bloomberg / Barclays indices moved to include China this year\n\n* More are expected
  to follow...\n\nWith the inclusion of China in these world indexes, other markets
  need to be down weighted - which means investors exposed to those markets may see
  capital flowing out.\n\n![Aberdeen Don Amstad](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7ogemVdZUbEBCiLihgKBfk/1367a7e6c787d6a4d34ffef4d6122dac/Aberdeen_Don_Amstad.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Q&A Session\n\nThe audience raised two very good questions, answers below:\n\n###
  What about corporate governance issues?\n\n**Don Amstad:**\n\n\"In the Asia Pacific,
  Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong have excellent but declining corp governance.
  China by comparison is quite poor, but it’s getting better fast. Tread carefully
  and do your due diligence - independent investigation of company governance is sometimes
  needed.“\n\n### What impact will the US/China trade war have?\n\n**Don Amstad:**\n\n\"It’s
  not just a trade war, it’s far more than that, it’s about the rise of China and
  the desire now of the current American administration to want to stop the rise of
  China and I think they are going to be very frustrated by that.\n\nOne of the big
  problems of the trade war is the reporting of it in the press is quite poor. The
  american position is well publicised, but the Chinese position is very poorly covered.\n\nTrump
  is upset at the US run such a large deficit with China, while it’s a factually correct
  position, more broadly it’s a counterproductive position to hold.\n\nHowever the
  relationship is much more balanced than Trump will ever acknowledge, and China’s
  ability to counter the USA’s moves is actually much greater than they are given
  credit for. Trump is finally waking up to who have been receiving the real benefits
  from this situation and has reversed some of his decisions.\n\nThe other reality
  is the political cycle, Trump needs to be reelected in 18 months, whereas Xi is
  potentially leader for life.\n\nFor China, what’s the point in striking a trade
  deal with Trump? He’s the kind of leader that can’t be trusted, who could wake up
  one day and turn his back on the deal. \n\nTrump positions himself as the master
  negotiator, I don’t think he’s come across anyone as organised and smart as the
  Chinese communist party - they’re wrong it they think it’s as disorganised as the
  US Democratic Party.\"\n\n**Thanks to everyone who participated in, and attended
