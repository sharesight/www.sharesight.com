:title: Why share registries aren't enough
:url_slug: why-share-registries-arent-enough
:content: "Share registries such as Computershare, Link Market Services, and Boardroom
  play a boring, yet highly important role in financial services. Boring is good in
  finance. Usually it means that investors aren’t getting screwed. Warren Buffett
  is boring. Index funds are boring. U.S. savings and loans were boring until they
  started handing out mortgages to anyone with a pulse. [Much like with online brokers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/),
  however, investors often think they’re seeing their whole portfolio picture by logging
  into their share registry investor centre. This is not the case. \n\nSo what exactly
  are the share registries responsible for, and what is left up to the investor? Keep
  reading to learn more. \n\n![Why share registries aren't enough](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3R4EzBnJVFK56BtTNPwywK/6ea5c524e82d5d9e39ee03e1975fe769/Why_share_registries_aren-t_enough_.jpg?w=950)\n\n###
  Shareholder record-keeping\n\nShare registries (or stock transfer agents) keep tabs
  on who owns what shares and how many. They work with the investor relations departments
  of listed companies. Employee share option plans and dividend reinvestment plans
  are also tracked by the registries. These are their primary sources of revenue and
  they do all of this well. Having an independent third-party perform this role is
  crucial, as a seemingly simple counting exercise gets complex when big money is
  at stake. Look no further than Apple’s [well-publicised](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2007/01/snow_jobs.html)
  options backdating scandal to see why. \n\n### No portfolio management\n\nFor all
  their record-keeping prowess though, share registries aren’t in the business of
  providing investor-facing websites or tools. While you can login and pull down basic
  information, there are critical information gaps. Plus, the sites don’t offer much
  in the way of functionality. They perform the role of umpire, providing you with
  a snapshot of today’s facts. Remember, registries make money from listed companies,
  not you, the investor. They have little incentive to provide you with a portfolio
  management service and as such, their investor-facing tools are built for bookkeeping,
  not investing.\n\n### No performance tracking\n\nA recent check of one of the most
  popular share registry sites revealed its limitations. Based on a single HIN or
  SRN, an investor can see the number of units held in a company, a transaction date,
  and the current price (not the original execution price). And that’s it. While you
  can see the current value of the shareholding, there’s no information about the
  cost basis. The dividend information available is limited to the net amount only
  and none of the data is editable.\n\nIn other words, there’s no information about
  capital gains or losses, your tax position, or the effect of income on your portfolio.\n\n###
  Can’t see all your data \n\nYour registry account is tied to a single HIN or SRN,
  meaning that if you have multiple entities, you need to login multiple times. To
  make your life admin even more complicated, each listed company may choose to use
  a different share registry. Chances are you’ll need logins to at least two different
  websites. And of course, you can’t make these sites \"talk\" to one another. A quick
  check of a portfolio on Sharesight revealed three different registries for the first
  three holdings we checked.\n\nSuch is the dilemma facing investors. Some information
  lives on your broker’s website, some with the registries, and some on paper. Sharesight
  works by combining all sources of data to form a complete and personalised portfolio
  record. Once you’ve done the work to set up your history, you can rely on Sharesight
  to be a single source of truth going forward.\n\n### A means to verify your portfolio
  data\n\nUsing the registry websites can be, however, a helpful step in verifying
  that the information you’ve added to Sharesight is accurate. If you’ve imported
  trades through the [File Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/),
  [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  or even manually, it’s a good idea to cross-check your portfolio with the registries
  once a year. And don’t forget you can look up registry information in Sharesight.
  Within a holding page, check the Instrument Detail menu to see which registry manages
  your share holdings.\n\n![Sharesight instrument detail Share registry](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6kVQOq59OMK7MwpoLoFPCZ/6e83bd92689bc97ef9143a8ecff4a0a6/Sharesight_instrument_detail_share_registry2.png?w=950)\n\n##
  A share registry is no substitute for a portfolio tracker\n\nShare registries have
  an important role to play, but they are no substitute for a portfolio tracking solution
  like Sharesight. Not only does Sharesight centralise information from multiple registries
  and brokers, but it allows investors to track the price and performance of their
  investments across different asset classes, markets and currencies – all in one
  place. This reduces tedious portfolio admin while providing investors with the full
  picture of their investments, allowing them to make informed investment decisions
  and save time and money at [tax time](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-ways-sharesight-helps-investors-at-tax-time/).\n\n##
