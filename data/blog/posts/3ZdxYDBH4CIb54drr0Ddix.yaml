:title: What is peer-to-peer lending?
:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only

  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant
  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nFluctuating equities and property
  market conditions have put many investors on the hunt for investments that can provide
  stable income to their portfolios. Traditionally this meant investing in fixed income
  products such as government or corporate bonds, however more recently investors
  have seen peer-to-peer lending emerge as an alternative.\n\nPrior to the arrival
  of peer-to-peer lending in Australia, consumer credit was a closed asset class,
  one which retail investors could only access indirectly via bank deposits or equity
  investments in the banks themselves. But with the arrival of peer-to-peer lending,
  this increasingly popular option is opening up consumer credit (and it’s attractive
  risk/return profile) to a much broader audience.\n\n So, what exactly is peer-to-peer
  lending?\n \n![peer to peer lending](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2287QYOkJEJNGVjFejMqvW/9fdfb076571866b7218128004fd6091d/peer_to_peer_lending__1_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is peer-to-peer lending?\n\nBroadly speaking, peer-to-peer lending uses technology
  to create an online marketplace that matches borrowers with investors. \n\nThe platform
  operator acts as an intermediary and makes an assessment on the creditworthiness
  of loan applicants - however it’s important to note this methodology by reading
  the PDS for each platform as it can differ between peer-to-peer lenders, nor is
  it the same as an external [credit agency rating](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/publications/factsheet-your-credit-report).
  For example, RateSetter evaluates a borrower’s credit history, employment status,
  and credit score. The platform operator will also manage the loan lifecycle including
  establishing loan contracts, facilitating payments between borrowers and investors
  and managing each investor’s portfolio.  \n\nInvestors using peer-to-peer lending
  platforms receive the borrower payments of principal and interest on loans each
  month, but *may also suffer losses* if a borrower to whom their funds are matched
  fail to make timely repayments or default on their loan. Some peer-to-peer lending
  platforms, such as RateSetter, may offer a form of protection against losses, through
  a ‘Provision Fund’. This is a pool of funds that may be available to compensate
  investors in the event of borrower late payment or default - It’s important to note
  that **these funds are not insurance and investors should understand how any compensation
  fund may or may not cover them** should such an event arise by reading the PDS.
  \n\n[ASIC regulates peer-to-peer or what is termed ‘marketplace lenders’](https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/marketplace-lending/marketplace-lending-peer-to-peer-lending-products/).
  Under Australia's financial services and credit laws, providers of marketplace lending
  products and related services will generally need to hold an Australian Financial
  Services (AFS) licence, and an Australian credit licence where the loans made through
  the platform are consumer loans (e.g. loans to individuals for domestic, personal
  or household purposes). \n\nAs the holder of an AFS licence, peer-to-peer lenders
  must have in place a complaints handling procedure that is explained in the PDS
  - and are required to respond to any complaints. Should their response not sufficiently
  resolve the issue, there are additional avenues to escalate including taking the
  matter to the [external dispute resolution (EDR) scheme](https://www.lawaccess.nsw.gov.au/Pages/representing/Local_courts_small_claims/chased_for_money/Responding_to_soc/External_DR.aspx)
  the platform belongs to listed in the PDS, as well as [contacting ASIC directly](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/how-to-complain).
  \    \n\n## Where do peer-to-peer loans fit in?\n\nThe way you use peer-to-peer
  loans will depend on your needs as an investor as well as your appetite for risk.
  Investing in a portfolio of peer-to-peer loans can be compared to some other investments
  such as corporate bonds or hybrids.\n\nFixed interest investments have traditionally
  been an attractive option for investors who are looking for a steady income stream.
  There are many types to choose from - each with varying risks and benefits:\n\n*
  **Government bonds** have long been a mainstay for fixed interest investors, thanks
  to the attraction of their high security and government guarantee of return of your
  principal. However, they offer modest returns.\n\n* **Corporate bonds** bear some
  similarity with government bonds in that they involve lending money, (in this case
  to a company), at an agreed interest over a set term, but there are important differences.
  Bonds can vary greatly in the amount of capital security they offer. Generally speaking,
  corporate bonds are less risky than buying shares in a company, but their ability
  to pay interest and to pay back your capital at maturity can be compromised if the
  company goes out of business.\n\n* **Mortgage schemes** are a type of managed fund
  that lends to borrowers to buy property or to undertake property development projects.
  On the surface these may seem safe and have attractive interest rates, but there
  are potentially higher risks. Mortgage schemes may be used to raise capital by developers
  who may not be able to secure loans from banks, due to the higher risks of borrowers
  defaulting or a property development project going bust.\n\n* The term ‘**hybrid
  security**’ is a catch-all name that covers a range of investments with odd sounding
  names, such as ‘capital notes’, ‘convertible preference shares’ and ‘subordinated
  notes’. These can be highly complex investments that are issued by institutions
  like banks, but this doesn’t mean that they offer the level of security that you
  would normally associate with bank investments (such as term deposits). Rates can
  be attractive but in certain circumstances your investment could be converted to
  shares in the bank and leave you with less capital than you initially invested.\n\nIn
  short, peer-to-peer lending may play a role alongside other fixed income securities
  like bonds and bank hybrids.\n\nIf you want to start investing with RateSetter you

  How to track peer-to-peer loans in Sharesight?\n\nIn order to record peer-to-peer
  loan investments in Sharesight, create a custom investment, fixed interest. You
  can enter interest rate, payment frequency or just record the interest payments
  manually as you receive them. Make sure that the quantity is the value of the loan,
  set price and face value to 1.\n\nFor example, if you have invested $10,000 with
  RateSetter, add this holding as a custom investment of type \"Fixed interest\".
  Enter the coupon rate or the interest rate that is promised as part of the investment.\n\n![image
