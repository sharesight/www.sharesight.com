:url_slug: 6-reasons-why-canadian-investors-love-sharesight
:content: "[Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com) is the award-winning portfolio
  tracker that automatically calculates your total annualised performance -- including
  brokerage fees, dividends, and currency fluctuations (something [brokers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/4-reasons-to-stop-relying-on-your-brokers-performance-reports/)
  and [spreadsheets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  don’t do). Investors in over [100 countries](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/create-sharesight-portfolios-in-over-100-countries/)
  trust Sharesight to track the performance of their investments, but there are a
  few features that we built specifically with Canada in mind.\n\nIf you’re a Canadian
  investor, here’s 6 reasons why you’ll love Sharesight:\n\n1. **[Track your Canadian
  stocks and mutual funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/6-reasons-why-canadian-investors-love-sharesight/#track-your-canadian-stocks-and-mutual-funds)**\n\n2.
  **[Easily import your historical trades from Canadian brokers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/6-reasons-why-canadian-investors-love-sharesight/#easily-import-your-historical-trades-from-canadian-brokers)**\n\n3.
  **[Track your registered and non-registered accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/6-reasons-why-canadian-investors-love-sharesight/#track-your-registered-and-non-registered-accounts)**\n\n4.
  **[Calculate your CGT with the Canadian Capital Gains Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/6-reasons-why-canadian-investors-love-sharesight/#calculate-your-cgt-with-the-canadian-capital-gains-tax-report)**\n\n5.
  **[Keep your portfolio up-to-date by forwarding your trade confirmations](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/6-reasons-why-canadian-investors-love-sharesight/#keep-your-portfolio-up-to-date-by-forwarding-your-trade-confirmations)**\n\n6.
  **[Track your Canadian and foreign currency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/6-reasons-why-canadian-investors-love-sharesight/#track-your-canadian-and-foreign-currency)**\n\n![6

  * *\n\n## 1 -- Track your Canadian stocks and mutual funds\n\nSharesight lets you
  track stocks and listed bonds from over [40 global stock exchanges](https://help.sharesight.com/ca/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),
  including the following Canadian markets:\n\n* **CNSX** -- Canadian Securities Exchange\n\n*
  **CVE** -- Toronto TSX Ventures Exchange\n\n* **TSE** -- Toronto Stock Exchange\n\nPlus
  Sharesight lets you [track over 40,000 Canadian mutual funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-canadian-mutual-funds-with-sharesight/),
  including 10 years of historical price and distribution data. Ongoing prices & distributions
  are automatically updated and editable at any time.\n\n## 2 -- Easily import historical
  trades from Canadian brokers\n\nGetting your portfolio data into Sharesight is easy.
  Most Canadian brokers -- including [Questrade](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-your-questrade-trades-into-sharesight/)
  and [Scotiabank](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-scotiabank-trades-using-sharesight/)
  -- allow you to download a CSV file of your historical trades from their client
  portals. You can then easily import the data into Sharesight in just a few clicks.
  And there’s no need to worry about corporate actions such as dividends and share
  splits. Sharesight will automatically suggest these for you, so all you need to
  do is confirm or edit them, and you’re good to go.\n\n![Canadian Brokers Supported

  [Wealthsimple](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/easily-track-wealthsimple-trades-with-sharesight/)\n\n##
  3 -- Track your registered and non-registered accounts\n\nIf you have a mix of [RRSP,
  RRIF](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/rrsp-and-rrif-canadian-tax-settings-in-sharesight-portfolios/),
  [TFSA](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-tfsa-with-sharesight/) and/or
  non-registered investment accounts, you should track them separately as they have
  different tax rules. Sharesight lets you track multiple portfolios under one account,
  so you can easily track your registered and non-registered tax entities in separate
  portfolios.\n\nWhen you set up a Sharesight portfolio with the tax residency set
  to \"Canada\", you have the choice of the following tax settings which conform to
  Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) tax reporting rules:\n\n| Tax Entity Type | Notes
  |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| Non-registered | Standard tax rules apply.|\n|
  Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)| Non-resident withholding tax does not
  apply for US stocks.|\n| Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) | Non-resident
  withholding tax does not apply for US stocks.|\n| Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)
  | Income from Canadian investments will be treated as non-taxable by default and
  not appear on the Taxable Income Report. Non-resident withholding tax still applies.|\n\nThe
  benefit of tracking your portfolios in Sharesight is that you can see all your investments
  in one place instead of having to look for them across various banks and brokers.
  Take it one step further by grouping your portfolios into a [Consolidated View](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/new-functionality-for-consolidated-views/),
  then run a [Performance Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/)
  to get a holistic view of your investments and how you’re doing overall.\n\n## 4
  -- Calculate your CGT with the Canadian Capital Gains Tax Report\n\nSharesight’s
  [Canadian CGT Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/)
  calculates capital gains (and losses) made on investments according to [Canada Revenue
  Agency (CRA) rules](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/calculating-reporting-your-capital-gains-losses.html)
  using the ‘adjusted cost base’ (ACB) sale allocation method, and is available in
  our [Investor and Expert plans](https://www.sharesight.com/au/pricing/):\n\n![Canadian
  CGT calculator](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4D6Rn0cnGHMFQXQQ9Ki0mD/affa11d63c8c58b2d25d9570303b72f6/Canadian_CGT_calculator.png?w=950)\n\nWith
  your capital gains and losses automatically sorted, you’ll save money on accounting
  fees at tax time. You can download your CGT report to PDF, Excel, or [Google Sheets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/new-open-sharesight-reports-directly-google-sheets/)
  and send it to your accountant (or better yet, [securely share your portfolio directly
  with your accountant](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/)
  so they have everything they need at their fingertips – not just at tax-time but
  throughout the year).\n\n## 5 -- Keep your portfolio up-to-date by forwarding your
  Trade Confirmation Emails\n\nKeeping your portfolio up-to-date with your latest
  trades is a crucial step to staying ahead of your portfolio admin, as it ensures
  that your performance figures are accurate and allows you to make timely data-driven
  investing decisions. If your online broker provides you with Trade Confirmation
  Emails (also known as a contract note), then you can send those emails to Sharesight
  and we’ll \"read\" them and add the trades to your portfolio. It’s just a matter
  of forwarding the emailed PDFs to us, or including Sharesight as a recipient on
  your trade confirmation emails. [Sharesight currently supports contract notes from
  over 200 brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/ca/supported_brokers/) worldwide,
  including the following 3 Canadian brokers:\n\n* [CIBC](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-cibc-investors-edge-trades-using-sharesight/)\n\n*
  [Scotiabank](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-scotiabank-trades-using-sharesight/)\n\n*
  [TD Direct](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-td-direct-investing-trades-using-sharesight/)\n\nIf
  your broker is not yet supported, you may [manually add your trades](https://help.sharesight.com/recording-trades-dividends-and-adjustments/)
  for now, and get in touch with our support team so we can add your broker to the
  list.\n\n## 6 -- Track your Canadian and foreign currency\n\nView your complete
  financial position by tracking your cash alongside your listed investments. You
  can [track over 75 worldwide currencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-investments-in-fx-currencies-with-sharesight/)
  (including the Canadian dollar) plus 8 [cryptocurrencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
