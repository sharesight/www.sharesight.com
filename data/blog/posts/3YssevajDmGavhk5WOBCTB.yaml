  a panel of speakers this week on behalf of the [Finimize](https://www.finimize.com/)
  Sydney community to discuss ‘What to Avoid when Investing’.\n\nSome of the mistakes
  investors make are pretty common and it helps to learn from other investors to avoid
  these common traps.\n\nAttendees learned about the problems of investing based on
  emotion, the need to do your due diligence when researching stocks to invest in,
  and when to know when it’s the right time to exit an investment.\n\n![What to avoid

  What is the most memorable investing mistake that you’ve made\n\n**Claude:** One
  of the first investments I made went to zero -- really underpinned the need to do
  my research and not ignore contrary information to my thesis.\n\n**Doug:** Getting
  burned on the GFC with a short real estate ETF, unfortunately I didn’t do my research
  and fully read the prospectus -- the instrument reset itself each day, with admin
  fees taken out.\n\n**Ted:** When I started out I thought I knew everything about
  investing, bought into Pacific Brands thinking they mostly owned Bonds and I knew
  all about that brand, but they actually own a large number of brands -- not all
  of which performed strongly.\n\n### Does it come down to emotions then?\n\n**Claude:**
  If I’ve not picked the risk, it ultimately comes down to a mistake on my part and
  you have to live with those - just don’t lose the lesson.\n\n### What is Robo-advice
  in relation to financial planning?\n\n**Ted:** I don’t think anything is going to
  replace quality face-to-face advice, but what we do at Six Park, which can be called
  ‘robo-advice’ -- it’s a form of advice that’s done online -- there’s no robots or
  cyborgs -- it’s real humans -- not the sort of holistic financial advice you might
  receive face to face, but can be a part of that.\n\n**Kylie:** The best financial
  planners I’ve seen are those that do that sort of holistic financial planning, they
  do the risk profile, estate planning and bring the family into the process -- one
  financial planner I work with always says wealth creation is the process of accumulation.
  The good financial planners are just \"Let’s start putting $25,000 away in your
  SMSF, if you start that early, that’s how you get rich\".\n\n### What about tax?\n\n**Kylie:**
  Make sure you're investing under the right tax structure, as if you're in a high
  tax bracket already, buying and selling stocks could mean you'll pay a lot more
  in tax -- and eating into your gains.\n\n## Questions from the audience\n\n![Audience
  QnA](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3eIAKVnYj7vfiFg1Z49kwz/6d28b8bf7a514018437bde3c463892f4/Audience_QnA.jpg?w=950)\n\n###
  How do you decide when you’re past that point with an investment you need to get
  out?\n\n**Claude:** When you make an investment you need to go in with a thesis
  on how you think it will turn out, if the share price is dropping that’s a clear
  sign to check the thesis and confirm it still holds up.\n\n**Doug:** For me it’s
  about discipline, writing down a thesis, and putting in some notes on a Google Keep
  note and checking in on that, a 10% drop is a good chance to reevaluate.\n\n**Ted:**
  For me, I like to hold a premortem, rather than a post mortem.\n\n**Kylie:** For
  me I’m so overweight in Xero after buying them when they first listed in Australia,
  something I need to reevaluate.\n\n### What sources do you look at?\n\n**Doug:**
  I would go to [morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/) for US stocks or [morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/)
  for Aus stocks -- or go direct to the company reports and read those - that’s where
  I always start -- factual information. \n\n**Claude:** I just want to double down
  on primary documents -- look at company annual reports and profit and loss statements
  -- if you don’t understand, Google for answers. Newsletters are useful for suggesting
  stocks to maybe take a look at, but always go for the primary documents during your
  process.\n\n### Kylie you mentioned women tend to invest differently, and Ted you
  mentioned over-confidence, how do men and women invest differently?\n\n**Ted:**
  At Six Park we look at the data analytics and can see who logs into the portfolio
  the most, and males typically who check their portfolio daily are more likely to
  change their risk profile and try and time the market, whereas women can be far
  more conservative and disciplined -- but also women are far more likely to keep
  money in cash, which may have negative impacts over time.\n\n**Kylie:** I’d agree,
  but also add most of the female clients I have invest more in property, just due
  to that risk profile.\n\n**Thanks to everyone who participated in, and attended
  this event. We look forward to hosting more in the very near future, stay tuned
