  As much as we enjoy being a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) business that works primarily online, we really love the chance to get out of the office from time-to-time and demo [Sharesight](/) to users on the ground. So when [Xero](/xero/) invited us to their recent Roadshow which took place across Australia during the month of February, our Business Development Manager Vanessa Gorman and Client Experience Specialist Lulu Ye eagerly packed their bags and set-off to get the word out about our perfect portfolio management system.

  ![2015 Xero Roadshow - Vanessa + Lulu](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/463fZwhnKUs44E0gmiEYQI/13a39cf0e717bb1125522abab217067c/Newscastle_Xero-Roadshow-2015_Vanessa-Lulu.jpg?w=950)

  If you followed [the tweets](https://twitter.com/hashtag/xeroroadshow), then you know that the overall theme seemed to be overwhelmingly huge turnouts in nearly every city. Not that should come as any surprise. Xero topped Forbes’ list of the [world’s most innovative growth company](https://www.forbes.com/growth-companies/list/) last year, and Australian Managing Director Chris Ridd announced that they’re quickly closing-in on the 200,000 customer mark in Australia. And just yesterday, [they announced a capital raise of NZ$147.2 million](https://www.xero.com/blog/2015/02/xero-adds-new-investor-director-and-us-president). So even more innovation and global growth is expected from the Wellington-based cloud accounting company.

  Beyond a slew of exciting product enhancements announcements, the “day in the life of a connected advisor” session really stood-out from our perspective, with local Xero Gold partners sharing tips and advice on how to evolve practices by improving workflow and the way advisors interact with clients and each other. We were so pleased to see Sharesight mentioned time and time again as a crucial part of that process, and the crowds at our stand following those sessions were proof that attendees really took the advice to heart.

  One of the best things about being part of the Xero Add-On ecosystem is the chance to work alongside the many great companies who make up this vibrant community. It’s always so nice to see the familiar faces of our mates from [CrunchBoards](https://www.futrli.com), [Deputy](https://www.deputy.com), [Fathom](https://www.fathomhq.com), [Practice Ignition](https://www.practiceignition.com), [Receipt Bank](https://www.receipt-bank.com), [Shoeboxed](https://www.squirrelstreet.com), [Spotlight Reporting](https://www.spotlightreporting.com), [Workforce Guardian](http://www.workforceguardian.com.au), [ZeroBooks](http://www.zerobooks.com) and others. It’s nice to be able to catch-up, talk strategy, and even go for long walks on the beach together (what happens in Frankston stays in Frankston)!

  Of course, it wouldn’t be a Xero Roadshow without a bit of fun mixed in. Having recently been featured in [XU Magazine](http://xumagazine.com), we jumped on the opportunity to pose for a selfie-stick photo with Xero Guru [Heather Smith](https://heathersmithsmallbusiness.com):

  And like many others, we had a blast with Xero’s portable photo booth frame and indulged in Deputy’s delicious cookies:

  A huge thank you to Xero for organizing another fantastic event and allowing us to tag along. The countdown is already on for [Xerocon Auckland](/blog/see-xerocon-auckland/) in April -- see you there!
