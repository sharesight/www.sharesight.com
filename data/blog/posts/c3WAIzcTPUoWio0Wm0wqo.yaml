:title: 2018 Sharesight stock picking competition - March update
:url_slug: 2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition--march-update
:content: "Last year we emailed [Sharesight](/) clients asking them to nominate one
  stock (from select markets) they believed would be the top performer for the 2018
  calendar year (January to December). We then constructed a Sharesight portfolio
  containing the nearly 100 stocks chosen, allocating $10,000 to each in the portfolio.
  \n\nWe’re approaching the end of the first quarter in 2018 for our stock picking
  competition. So after three months, which stocks are in the lead, and which have
  performed the worst in the competition?\n\n![featured sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2c0QkcckTOG6ogCOoSG0OM/4bfa658c0ff385d657680e730f455704/featured_sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How is the overall portfolio performing?\n\nIn a word, subdued. As at March 12 when
  our snapshot was taken, the Sharesight stock picking competition portfolio was down
  1.87%. My guess is that individual growth stocks that might be long shots for a
  breakout year (and to win a stock picking competition) may not be the best to build
  a portfolio around. Time will tell if this trend continues throughout 2018.\n\n![Screen

  competition\n\nWe’ve made the [2018 Sharesight stock picking competition portfolio
  public](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)
  for anyone to view, removing the need to be logged-in to Sharesight to follow your
  stock’s performance against all other entries throughout the competition.\n\nEven
  if you don’t have a stock pick, this is an excellent way to follow the Sharesight
  competition. Bookmark the [2018 Sharesight stock picking competition public portfolio](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)
  to check back at any time.\n\n### 2018 Stock Picking Competition Notes:\n\nWe collated
  your responses (discarding invalid picks/typos/duplicates) and created a Sharesight
  portfolio with a holding of each share picked, with the following rules:\n\n- The
  2018 Sharesight Stock Picking Competition portfolio was created with a tax residency
  in Australia (with the performance of shares in markets outside Australia subject
  to currency effects) \n- We “invested” $10,000 in each holding, but did not include
  brokerage for matters of convenience here. (Sharesight factors the impact of fees
  when [calculating portfolio performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/),
  as [reducing portfolio fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092815/how-optimize-your-portfolio-and-reduce-fees.asp)
  can improve returns).\n- All dividends are/will be included in the total performance
  calculation, and are reinvested. \n- Performance figures are total return (versus
  annualised) as none of the portfolio positions has been held for longer than one
  year.\n- The winner will be the person(s) who picked the top performing stock over
  the period January 1st through to December 31st 2018.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
