  Superheroes spend a lot of time in the clouds but now they’re bringing the cloud to you. Why? So you can learn how cloud services are transforming the lives of accountants and bookkeepers everywhere -- without having to read a book or spend a whole day at a boring conference. The presentations will be short, blindingly informative and probably spandex-free, although we can’t guarantee that. But the event is **completely free**. If you can save the world without raising an invoice or being registered for GST, how can you charge for beer, wine and canapés?

  ## The Cloud Superheroes
