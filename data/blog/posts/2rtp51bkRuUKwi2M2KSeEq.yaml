:title: How to calculate your 2017 FIF income

:content: "###### NOTE: There is a newer version of this article. See [*How to calculate
  your NZ FIF income*](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/) for more information.\n\nWhen
  it comes to investing, tax reporting can be a real hassle. This is especially true
  for New Zealand residents with offshore holdings. That’s because there are special
  tax requirements for investors with certain types of overseas investments -- also
  known as foreign investment funds.\n\n![featured nz-tax](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2eNhJNpF24o0kuKIKgagaQ/a133ac284653e23dff00992d20500389/featured_nz-tax.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a foreign investment fund (FIF)?\n\nAs stated by the New Zealand Inland
  Revenue Department (IRD), a foreign investment fund (FIF) is an offshore investment
  held by a New Zealand-resident taxpayer who holds:\n\n- less than 10% of the shares
  in a foreign company\n- less than 10% of the units in a foreign unit trust\n- between
  10% and 40% of the shares in a foreign company which is not a CFC\n- an interest
  in a life insurance policy where a FIF is the insurer and the policy is not offered
  or entered into in New Zealand\n\nIt does not include interest earned from term
  deposits, bonds, debentures or money lent.\n\n## Calculate your 2017 FIF income\n\nAs
  a result of these IRD rules, investors who have certain types of overseas investments
  may have FIF income. And while the IRD has an online tool that lets you check if
  you are required to do anything under the FIF rules, if you determine that you do,
  the actual calculations can get quite complicated.\n\nThe good news is that investors
  on a [Sharesight NZ Expert](/nz/pricing/) or [Sharesight NZ Pro](/nz/pro/) plan
  can run their own [FIF Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/new_fdr_report_page/)
  in just a few clicks. This lets you:\n\n### 1. Determine which of your holdings
  are subject to FIF\n\nBefore we go any further, here’s a bit of background information:\n\n-
  In previous years, the IRD published an Australian share exemption lists -- also
  known as the IR871. \n- The list indicated whether an Australian company listed
  on the ASX (excluding listed investment companies) was exempt from the FIF rules
  for that financial year.\n- Due to copyright restrictions, the IRD can no longer
  publish this list.\n- Instead, the IRD has provided the Australian share exemption
  list 2017 calculator.\n\nTo simplify this process, Sharesight automatically excludes
  any holdings within your portfolio which were included in the Australian share exemption
  list 2016 IR871:\n\n![screenshot - sharesight FIF #1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Eoxqwa1y0u2yY4M2mmG8w/2a79b9954f583ff3a89a888ee3b055c7/screenshot_sharesight_fif-1.png?w=950)\n\n######
  **NOTE:** We recommend double-checking your FIF included companies against the IRD
  calculator. If you notice any holdings that are not automatically included/excluded,
  please leave a message on our dedicated forum topic: [NZ investors: calculate your
  2017 FIF income](https://community.sharesight.com/sharesight/topics/nz-investors-calculate-your-2017-fif-income).\n\n###
  2. Calculate your 'peak holding balance'\n\nThis determines whether you exceed the
  FIF threshold ($50,000 for individuals). Based on the example above, the answer
  is \"yes\" because the peak balance is $71,782.66.\n\n### 3. Calculate your FIF
  income\n\nIf you determine that you exceed the FIF threshold, clicking the \"Calculate\"
  button will automatically calculate your FIF income under both the [Fair Dividend
  Rate Method](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/fdr_income_fif_reports_page/) and [Comparative
  Value Method](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/cv_method_fif_reports_page/) (generally
  you are permitted to use either methodology, but check with your accountant if you
  are unsure as there are some exceptions):\n\n![screenshot - sharesight FIF #2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1pasBlmKzusGo0K6WUseAk/ed405e71613a2d2f8bc862b3c4f23c29/screenshot_sharesight_fif-2.png?w=950)\n\n##
