:title: How I make the most of my Sharesight portfolios
:url_slug: how-i-make-the-most-of-all-my-sharesight-portfolios
:content: "If you’ve been using Sharesight for a while, you’re probably aware that
  you can use Sharesight for Free to track up to 10 holdings in one portfolio, and
  when you upgrade to an [Investor, Expert](https://www.sharesight.com/pricing/) or
  [Sharesight Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/) plan you unlock additional portfolios
  based on the plan you select.\n\nBut if you’re like me, you may only need a handful
  of portfolios to track the shares you actually own. If that’s the case, you may
  be left with a couple unused portfolios. As the saying goes, *a Sharesight portfolio
  is a terrible thing to waste*. Since you’ve got access to those extra portfolios
  as part of your premium plan, you may as well use them to become a better investor.
  In this article, I’ll share how I use my portfolios to track my:\n\n1. <a href=\"#i-use-one-sharesight-portfolio-to-track-my-trading-account\">Trading

  I make the most of my Sharesight portfolios](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6C3kGZ9DT30KV0mfYZa4id/84e47ddab03902bbd83b87ae56c4c51f/How_I_make_the_most_of_my_Sharesight_portfolios.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  1 -- I use one Sharesight portfolio to track my trading account\n\nThis is made
  up of shares I’ve bought locally (on the ASX) since I started investing on my own
  a few years ago. At time of writing, it includes 13 holdings (mostly ETFs and a
  few individual shares). I track this portfolio very closely, both on my laptop and
  on the [Sharesight mobile app](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/introducing-the-sharesight-mobile-app/).\n\n##
  2 -- I use a Sharesight portfolio to track my RRSP\n\nI’m from Canada and I participated
  in an [RRSP](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/rrsp-and-rrif-canadian-tax-settings-in-sharesight-portfolios/)
  (registered retirement savings plan) before moving to Australia. The portfolio is
  made up of a couple mutual funds traded on the TSE so it’s in Canadian dollars.
  This is a portfolio that I no longer contribute to directly, but I do reinvest the
  dividends. Although it’s not a portfolio I track very closely, I’ve loaded it into
  Sharesight so I can check in on it from time to time (and also because [the reports
  offered by my broker are really terrible](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/4-reasons-to-stop-relying-on-your-brokers-performance-reports/)).\n\n##
  3 -- I use a Sharesight portfolio to track my Superannuation\n\nWorking in Australia
  provides me with a Superannuation portfolio, which my employer (Sharesight) contributes
  to as part of my remuneration. As the fund is unlisted and not unitised, I use Sharesight’s
  [Custom Investment](https://help.sharesight.com/unquoted-instruments/) and update
  the total every now and then based on my current balance. This is less about tracking
  the portfolio’s performance, and more about tracking my overall balance alongside
  my other investments.\n\n## 4 -- I use a Sharesight portfolio as an investment watchlist\n\nOne
  of the best uses I’ve found for my extra portfolios is by setting up an investment
  watchlist. It makes it really easy to keep track of various stocks and compare them
  against each other.\n\nWhile I could have set up a watchlist in [Google Finance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/4-ways-sharesight-is-better-than-google-finance/)
  or [Yahoo Finance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/yahoo-finance-vs-sharesight--comparing-portfolio-trackers/),
  I decided not to bother since they don’t factor in the impact of dividends or currency
  fluctuations fees into the returns. Sharesight on the other hand, makes this super
  easy to track these at a glance:\n\n![screenshot angela-watchlist-min](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5S3ONz0ohStWOOROJeX8QF/7e281a7f96db6b7134bceabe9f645738/screenshot_angela-watchlist-min.png?w=950)\n\nMy
  watchlist has been especially useful when I’ve been researching different stocks
  to buy -- especially ETFs that have similar regions or themes. For example, when
  I was looking to invest in ETFs that track emerging markets, I added the ones I
  was interested in so I could compare them side-by-side:\n\n![screenshot angela-watchlist-emerging-min](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2wS4giGxleQ5eanx3KQLRx/ffe9a771c5154c0950b7a90829a565ff/screenshot_angela-watchlist-emerging-min.png?w=950)\n\nBy
  doing this, I was able to check the performance of these ETFs over different periods
  to \"backtest\" their returns over time. This is much easier than scrolling through
  the various ETF providers’ websites. Also, being able to compare the capital gain
  and dividend yield components of the various ETFs in this way is very handy and
  not something I was getting anywhere else.\n\n## 5 -- I use Sharesight to track
  my model portfolio\n\nAnother use I’ve found for my extra Sharesight portfolios
  is creating my own model portfolio. Essentially, I created a model portfolio containing
  all the stocks I was looking to eventually own, and used [Custom Groups](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  to organise them according to my preferred asset allocation methodology. I used
  the Diversity Report to ensure the proportions were as close as possible to what
  I was trying to achieve:\n\n![Diversity Report Sharesight Angela-s portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5p31IdNvdEP0QYkd3LplyI/e8e6d732e8d135d2c2cca03287e22262/Diversity_Report_Sharesight_Angela-s_portfolio.png?w=950)\n\nThis
  was especially handy when I was first getting started with investing, and didn’t
  yet own all the stocks I wanted, in the proportions I wanted for my target asset
  allocation. It allowed me to do a bit of backtesting to see how the portfolio performed
  over various periods of time.\n\nWhen I started investing a few years ago, I was
  planning to only invest in ETFs. Since then, I’ve decided to invest in a few individual
  companies as well. I’ve found that having a model portfolio has been a very useful
  way for me to compare my actual performance to my model portfolio, and ensure I’m
  staying on track with my investing goals.\n\n## More ways to use your Sharesight
  portfolios\n\nI've explored how I personally use my Sharesight portfolios, but there
  are plenty more ways to take advantage of extra portfolios. \n\n### Track your family's
  investments\nOne of the great things about having extra portfolios is that you can
  track your family's investments. This is especially useful if you have a tax residency
  that requires you to file joint taxes with a spouse, or if you manage investments
  for other family members. In this case, you may wish to run a [Consolidated View](https://help.sharesight.com/au/viewing-holdings-within-the-consolidated-view/)
  to see the total return on your investments as a family. \n\n### Track an investment
  club\nIf you belong to a share investing club, tracking your club's portfolio on
  Sharesight is a great way to create transparency among members. By using Sharesight's
  [portfolio sharing](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/) feature, you
  can ensure members have access to the club's portfolio data at any given time, making
  club meetings less about establishing what's in the portfolio and more about the
  investing decisions the club wants to make. Sharesight's advanced reporting tools
  such as [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/),
  [Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculate-investment-portfolio-diversification-sharesight/),
  [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  and [Multi-Period](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/multi-period-report/) can also
  be very useful when making decisions for the club's portfolio.\n\n### Track an employee
  share scheme \nIf you have investments in an employee share scheme (also known as
  an employee share plan), you can easily [track the performance of these shares](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-employee-stock-plans/)
  in Sharesight. In this case, it is recommended that you use one portfolio for your
  vested shares and another portfolio for unvested shares. Then when your shares vest
  you can simply sell them out of the unvested portfolio and buy them in your vested
  portfolio. Or if you only have one portfolio to spare, you can use Sharesight's
  [Custom Groups](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/) feature to tag unvested
  and vested shares and keep them in the same portfolio. \n\n### Track other tax sheltered
  accounts\nI mentioned that I track my RRSP, but you can also use Sharesight to track
  other tax sheltered accounts such as a [Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/rrsp-and-rrif-canadian-tax-settings-in-sharesight-portfolios/)
  or [Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-tfsa-with-sharesight/)
  for Canadian investors, or a [Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  for Australian investors. Simply click 'Tax Settings' in your Sharesight portfolio
  and select the relevant account type. The ensures that the correct tax treatment
  will be applied to your portfolio. \n\n## Track all of your investments in one place
