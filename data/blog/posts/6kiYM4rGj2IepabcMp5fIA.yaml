:title: NZX-50 sector and stock performance 2013-2018
:url_slug: nzx-50-sector-and-stock-performance-2013-2018
:content: "Since investors using Sharesight typically tend to lean towards a [‘buy
  and hold’ investing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-reasons-why-buy-and-hold-investors-use-sharesight/)
  philosophy, it’s important to look at returns over longer periods. In this post,
  we’re examining the returns of stocks in New Zealand’s [NZX-50 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZX_50_Index)
  and the corresponding returns for each sector and key stocks in each sector of the
  index in order to look for underlying trends over the last 5 years (2013-2018).\n\n##
  Sharesight performance calculation methodology\n\nSharesight calculates *annualised*
  returns that *include dividends* -- we do this using a [dollar weighted return](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/)
  calculation method when there are multiple buy/sell trades within a measurement
  period. For this exercise we \"purchased\" a single parcel of each stock on 1 Jan
  \ 2013 and used [Sharesight’s performance report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  to calculate the annualised return including dividends (total annualised return)
  through to 31 December 2018. In this post we've used [Sharesight's compounded annual
  return](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/) method to calculate
  these annualised returns.\n\n## NZX-50 performance 2013-2018 \n![NZX-50 performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6HxTC8rQA8WpxijncZVpKI/53ad946da63248968cc8425682ed806b/NZX-50_performance.png?w=950)\n\nUsing
  the [Smartshares NZ Top 50 ETF (FNZ)](https://smartshares.co.nz/types-of-funds/smartlarge/fnz)
  as a proxy to capture the dividend and capital gain performance of the NZX-50 index
  in Sharesight (read our [rationale for benchmarking your portfolio against ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)),
  we find an extremely strong performance for the index through to August 2014 before
  falling away, underpinning the importance of understanding the impact of [holding
  periods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiod.asp) in your investment
  performance.\n\nOver the 5 years from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2018, NZX:FNZ
  recorded a 13.82% total annual return, with 6.03% of that return coming from dividends.\n\n##
  Performance of each sector in the NZX-50\n\nSharesight uses the [FactSet Revere
  Business Industry Classification System](https://open.factset.com/products/factset-rbics/en-us)
  to classify companies by industry and sector (when looking at a holding in Sharesight,
  this information is available in the ‘instrument detail’ section).\n\n![Performance
  of each sector in NZX 50](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/uBPFklhC82GI0z9L4mg28/f1ef3a09fd2b5577d4d3cfed233b07e5/Performance_of_each_sector_in_NZX_50.png?w=950)\n\nWe
  used this sector break down to split out the performance by sector within the NZX-50
  over the 2013-2018 period. Here’s that performance by sector -- simply click on
