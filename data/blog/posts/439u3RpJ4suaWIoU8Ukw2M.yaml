:title: Sharesight portfolio sharing now on all plans (even free!)
:content: "[Sharesight’s portfolio sharing](/blog/sharing-is-caring/) has been a very
  popular feature of our [premium plans](/pricing/) for a number of years now. Given
  its popularity, we have made portfolio sharing available to everyone -- including
  [free Sharesight Free plans](/).\n\n![featured free-portfolio-sharing](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/E6iKvPXY3ucQ4wyiWu6iw/f4117db8a20089c9ef9923bb7ad3a6fb/featured_free-portfolio-sharing.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Who can I share a Sharesight portfolio with?\n\nYou can share your [Sharesight](/)
  portfolio with anyone, even if they do not have a Sharesight account. Anyone without
  their own Sharesight account will be granted guest access, and those with Sharesight
  accounts will see any portfolio shared with them when they’re logged-in to their
  account.\n\n![Portfolios shared with me](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1JgKb3R6sIGC2cm0q8yyoo/a9efefa340973eb69ac1525f09778818/Portfolios_shared_with_me.png?w=950)\n\nSharesight
  portfolios are most commonly shared with family members to jointly track performance,
  or accountants and financial advisers so they can provide feedback and professional
  guidance on your investments. \n\nOther examples of people sharing their portfolios
  include investors running a share club, or friends with a shared interest in investing.\n\n##
  How to share your Sharesight portfolio\n\nFor the step-by-step guide on sharing
  your Sharesight portfolio read our [portfolio sharing help page](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/).
  If you’re the type of person who likes to just jump right in, you can get started
  by clicking the ‘Settings’ tab and clicking 'Portfolio Sharing' as shown in the
  screenshot below.\n\n![Portfolio Sharing - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5WFiDhH6olTClLmuUaQJEj/7d19776979a130cd2a981b3fe307b794/sharesight-portfolio-sharing.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Sharing is caring\n\nWe’re DIY investors at Sharesight ourselves, and have written
  about the [importance of sharing your portfolio before](/blog/sharing-is-caring/)
  -- so we’re excited to be able to share this important feature with everyone who
  uses Sharesight. We’d love to hear your stories of how you use our portfolio sharing
