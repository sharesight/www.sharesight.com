:title: Sharesight appoints Jessica Goodall as Chief Customer Officer
:content: "We are excited to announce that Jessica Goodall has joined Sharesight in
  the role of Chief Customer Officer (CCO) to further improve the customer experience
  for Sharesight users as we continue to grow internationally. Formerly with [Partnerize](https://partnerize.com/),
  a global SaaS Partner Management Platform (PMP) and bringing a wealth of experience
  to Sharesight, Jessica is the latest addition to our team in Sydney, and I sat down
  with her to find out more:\n\n![Jessica Announcement](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4JGQCoUMWSl97kHn5wmWVA/73eea8de9f7f6286ba38ac847d661072/Jessica_Announcement.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Can you tell us a bit about yourself? \n\nI’m from the UK, but have spent around
  one third of my life outside of it, and have been living in Australia for almost
  8 years. Growing up in a large and lively family meant a lot of travel and freedom
  to take risks from a young age, both themes that have carried through to my career
  as an adult.\n\nMy career has been somewhat unorthodox and certainly non-linear,
  it’s mostly included experiences in financial services in London & Sydney and Martech
  throughout APAC, but has also included a stint on a cattle station in Outback Australia,
  which was the most illuminating experience in my career to date. Living and working
  in rural Australia taught me a lot about the value of grit and humility in business,
  and even more importantly, applying a customer centric approach to decision making,
  even in the harshest and most unpredictable market conditions.    \n\n## What excites
  you the most about Sharesight?\n\nI’ve always been interested in organisations that
  exist to empower and educate their customers to make their own decisions. The thing
  I love the most about Sharesight’s portfolio tracker is that it brings some much
  needed clarity and context to our customers, helping them to become better investors.\n\nAs
  a strong advocate for financial literacy for everyone I’m particularly excited to
  be working at Sharesight. \n\nAlthough most of our customers would consider themselves
  experienced investors, Sharesight is a valuable tool for anyone looking to understand
  investing and depending on the number of investments you have, can be free to use.
  I love hearing about our customers who have used Sharesight for school and university
  assignments, or parents who have used it to educate their own children on investing.
  We’ve also seen a huge increase in women getting into investing over the last year
  and taking control of their investments with Sharesight.\n\n## What are your top
  priorities as Sharesight CCO?\n\nAs a proponent of the Customer Success methodology,
  \ my main priority is to ensure that our customers are able to attain the full value
  of Sharesight as quickly and easily as possible, to ultimately become better investors.
  \ Practically this will initially mean expanding our Customer Support team to continue
  providing an excellent customer experience to even more customers, as well as establishing
  Sharesight's first dedicated Customer Success team who will be responsible for helping
  our customers get the most out of Sharesight through targeted education and enablement
  initiatives.  \n\n## What do you enjoy doing when you’re not at Sharesight?\n\nI’m
  lucky to live in the beautiful Southern Highlands region of NSW which gives me easy
  access to the mountains, bush, beaches and award winning restaurants and wineries,
  this means I spend a lot of time hiking, swimming, cooking and eating with friends
  and family.\n\nI’m a real bookworm so I love to unwind by reading and scrolling
  through \"bookstagram\" content, one of the more positive corners of the internet.\n\n##
  Tell us something most people don’t know about yourself\n\nI’m a backyard \"farmer\"
  and beekeeper and love spending time outside tending to my veggie patch, flowers,
  honey bees and recently acquired chickens.\n\n## Taking Sharesight’s customer experience
  to the next level\n\nJessica is focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience
  to the [more than 150,000 investors](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-passes-150000-users-worldwide/)
  in over 100 countries that now use Sharesight. Not to mention the *next 150,000*
  (and beyond) as Sharesight continues to grow around the world. \n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
