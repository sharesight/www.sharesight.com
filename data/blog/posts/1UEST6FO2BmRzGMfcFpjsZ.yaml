  </p> </details>\n<br>\n\n## Why investors should track their trades in global markets
  with Sharesight\n\nUsing Sharesight, it’s easy for investors worldwide to [track
  the price and performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  of stocks, ETFs and funds listed on the **SSE**, **SET**, **MOEX**, **GPW** and
  **EN Dublin**, along with the rest of their investments across different markets,
  brokers and currencies. By tracking all of their investments in Sharesight, investors
  gain a portfolio-wide view of their performance through Sharesight’s advanced reporting
  built for the needs of self-directed investors. Investors also get the full picture
  of their returns with Sharesight’s [annualised performance calculation methodology](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/),
  which includes the impact of capital gains and losses, brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and foreign exchange rates when calculating performance.\n\n### Track dividend income
  from stocks\n\nUnlike other portfolio trackers, Sharesight automatically [tracks
  dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and includes this information when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make a significant contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the value of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more than
  just capital gains in its performance calculations.\n\n![dividend return Shanghai
  Stock Exchange](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/l2Zrfn4ZnGrUtbYC0ouas/c42cb0aa0c913bd6b337d2321a9f2509/dividend_return_Shanghai_Stock_Exchange.PNG)\n\n<small>
  An example of an SHG stock where dividends contribute 20.81% in returns, which inclusive
  of 43.60% capital gains and -0.90% currency gain, results in a net total return
  of 63.51%. </small> \n\n### Run powerful performance reports built for investors\n\nFor
  investors who want a more detailed breakdown of their portfolio’s performance, Sharesight
  offers a range of powerful reports including:\n\n* [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/):
  Calculate your total portfolio returns over any selected period.\n\n* [Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/):
  Discover how the assets in your portfolio are diversified across different investment
  sectors, investment types, countries and markets.\n\n* [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/):
  Measure the impact of your holdings and asset allocations on your overall portfolio
  performance.\n\n* [Multi-Currency Valuation Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/):
  See the value of your investments denominated in the currency of your choice. \n\n*
  [Future Income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/):
  View announced dividends and interest payments expected for investments in your
  portfolio.\n\n### Calculate the impact of investments on your portfolio’s returns\n\nIn
  the screenshot below, you can see the [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  (sorted by market) being used to assess the ‘weight’ of various markets in a portfolio
  including SHG, BKK, MISX, WAR and DUB stocks. This would be particularly useful
  for an investor looking to compare the relative contribution of their investments
  in a specific market to the total return on their portfolio, for instance. In this
  example, the BKK is the main contributor to the portfolio’s returns, constituting
  43.44% and £42,003.06 (or ฿1,850,959.74).\n\n![contribution analysis report new
