:title: How to handle the M2 Vocus merger to account for CGT
:url_slug: how-to-handle-the-m2-vocus-merger
:content: "ASX-listed telecom companies [M2 and Vocus announced a merger](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/m2-group-and-vocus-the-new-tpg)
  to create the region's 4th largest telco by market cap and to realise cost savings
  by combining operations.\n\n## What the merger means for investors\nFor M2 shareholders,
  this means that your M2 shares (MTU) will be converted into Vocus (VOC) shares at
  a set ratio. While the merger&nbsp;does not result in an immediate tax event due
  to rollover relief, you may be subject to capital gains tax if you sell your newly
  acquired Vocus shares within the next 12 months. While this [corporate action](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/)
  is deemed a merger, it more resembles Vocus taking over M2 for the purposes of your
  investment portfolio.\n\n![M2 Vocus Merger - Featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3NSJ1b0RgcoaG6uMEyqw8w/99396472a5474686e7978007590aaa81/featured_m2-vocus-merger.png?w=950)\n\n##
  How to handle the M2 Vocus merger in Sharesight\nFortunately, [Sharesight](/) makes
  it easy for investors to handle corporate actions, even complicated demergers, and
  to track the capital gains tax implications. Using Sharesight to track this merger
  will also maintain an accurate record of your portfolio performance.\n\n###### Please
  note that we always advise you to consult your financial advisor or accountant regarding
  corporate actions, especially for tax purposes, as we are not authorised to provide
  financial advice. The information below, including the dates is subject to change.
  We encourage you to review the offical [M2 Vocus merger document](http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/IROL/16/160918/Press_releases/2015/ASX-VOC-735950.pdf)
  for full details.\n\n#### Follow these steps to handle the M2 Vocus merger:\n\n1.
  [**Sign up for a FREE Sharesight account**](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  and add your M2 holding.\n\n2. Remove your M2 holding by [recording a sell transaction](https://help.sharesight.com/recording-trades-dividends-and-adjustments/)
  at the cost base so that no CGT is calculated. If you have several M2 transactions
  you can obtain your cost base data by going to the [Historical Cost Report](https://help.sharesight.com/historical_cost_report/)
  found in the Reports menu. Set the sell date to 8 February 2016. (see screenshot
  below)\n\n3. To reflect your new Vocus shareholding, first calculate how many shares
  you're entitled to based on the officially announced ratio of 1.625 Vocus shares
  for every 1 M2 share.\n\n4. Add a new holding and use the [opening balance feature](https://help.sharesight.com/recording-trades-dividends-and-adjustments/).
  This allows you to enter a cost base which is used for CGT reporting (the original
  cost base of your M2 shares in this case), but performance reporting will be calculated
  based on the change in market value from the opening balance date. Use 8 February
  as the opening balance date. (see screenshot below)\n\nNote: using this approach
  means that your [CGT Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/) will
  not account for any CGT discount if you choose to sell your newly acquired Vocus
  shares in the next 12 Months. For tax purposes you may consider backdating the opening
  balance date as required when you run a CGT report, or downloading the CGT report
  into Excel format and making a manual adjustment.\n\n**Record a sell trade at your
  cost base for M2:**\n![M2 Vocus merger - screenshot 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7KcZpI5awwWuWEyMq8Sgg6/d5a38a35b920df12f5f1bb8774c41a20/m2vocus-1.png?w=950)\n\n**Record
  your new Vocus shares by using an opening balance:**\n![M2 Vocus merger](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/15rwO2jqEsSKSoQk0eyiC2/ea839f9a3919cde56a2a86f2f68e0131/m2vocus1-700x611.png?w=950)\n\n###
  What happens if I own both M2 and Vocus prior to the merger?\nIf you already owned
  VOC before the merger, using an Opening Balance transaction (per step 3 above) would
  not work.\n\nIn this instance, you should enter a new Buy transaction/s (for VOC)
  which emulates the dates at which M2 had originally been bought. You should adjust
  the quantities based on the ratio 1:1.625 (M2:VOC). \n\nNote: If you have a large
  number of M2 trades, you can download the [All Trades Report](https://help.sharesight.com/trades_report/)
  in Excel and filter out M2 specifically. This way you can obtain all of the necessary
  information, including dates and prices, while still adjusting the quantity per
  the merger ratio.\n\nAs long as all of the past dividends in Vocus have been confirmed,
  entering these new Buy transactions should not affect any dividends that have been
  recorded and confirmed in VOC, only future dividends going forward.\n\nBy using
  the M2 purchase dates as the dates for the new VOC shares, this should allow for
  rollover relief for CGT purposes.\n\nFor most investors these corporate actions
  can be time consuming and confusing. Sharesight provides you with the tools and
  technology to keep your portfolio up to date. And remember to check our [community
  forum](https://community.sharesight.com) for steps to handle these corporate actions
