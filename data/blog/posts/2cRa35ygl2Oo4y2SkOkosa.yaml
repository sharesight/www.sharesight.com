:title: How much money can Sharesight save you?
:content: "Clichés are clichés because they’re true. “Gotta spend money to make money”
  is one of them. The bottom line is that purchasing [Sharesight](/) saves investors
  money... and time, which is money. Another cliché!\n\nHere’s a real life example
  of why this is true.\n\n![Laptop & Calculator - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/44g7PPrFy8UIg62WE6goYI/7a9405a55ab8244bf2646fa674530a23/laptop-calculator_featured.png?w=950)\n\nConsider
  Harry. Harry doesn’t use Sharesight. He’s a self-directed investor who earns an
  annual salary of $100,000. At any given time, he holds roughly 25 stocks and trades
  about 35 times per year. During the year he receives around 40 dividends and the
  odd corporate action impacts a couple of his holdings.\n\nLike 70% of people who
  eventually turn to Sharesight, Harry tries to [track his portfolio in a spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/).
  Even though he’s probably misleading himself in terms of his [true performance](/blog/interpreting-portfolio-performance/),
  he spends an hour each month keeping this albatross up to date. (In reality 12 hours
  probably significantly understates the time he actually spends on the portfolio
  spreadsheet each year, but we'll start there.)\n\nSo that’s 12 of Harry’s hours,
  which on his salary works out to be $577.\n\nNow comes tax time. Like most people,
  Harry’s a proponent of the “shoebox” recordkeeping system. This means that when
  he receives a trade confirmation, registry letter, or account statement he throws
  it into a shoebox and slides it under the bed. He feels organised because everything
  he needs is in one place, but the reality is that come tax time, this will come
  to be a jumbled stack of paper.\n\nLet’s assume Harry decides to hire an accountant
  for $120 per hour. It’s Harry’s responsibility to collect and deliver all of his
  paperwork to the accounting firm, only so they can recreate his investment history
  - something that Harry has already sunk $577 worth of his time trying to do.\n\nThe
  efficiency and specialisation of an accounting firm will vary, but let's assume
  that Harry’s accountant spends 8 hours (a business day, give or take) preparing
  his file. This means Harry owes his accountant $960. \n\n__In this scenario, Harry
  spent $1,537 on investment admin for 12 months.__\n\n|&nbsp;|![icon - man](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/n6TfChbzB6YQUggMC4gGq/83e55eeeed14048e2f03eb602bb671c4/icon_man.png?w=950)<br><center>HARRY</center>|![icon

  consider Olivia. She earns the same salary as Harry and is same type of investor.
  But rather than tracking her investments in a spreadsheet, Olivia subscribes to
  the [Sharesight Investor Plan](https://www.sharesight.com/pricing/) for $275.\n\nSome
  investors use Sharesight for [performance reporting](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  some for [tax](/blog/5-ways-sharesight-makes-eofy-a-breeze/) specifically. Regardless,
  to use Sharesight is to have your trades, dividends, and corporate actions tracked
  automatically, which means that your cost bases are accurate. Built into its DNA,
  Sharesight is a recordkeeping powerhouse.\n\nOlivia, therefore, has no need to maintain
  a spreadsheet. Even if she has investments with multiple brokers, or with an advisor,
  all she needs to do is login (or [check her mobile](/blog/introducing-the-sharesight-mobile-app/))
  to instantly see her performance. She’s free to dig down to the cost base level,
  check dividends, and run reports.\n\nAt this point, Olivia has saved $302 compared
  to Harry.\n\nLike Harry, Olivia hires an accountant for $120 per hour to prepare
  her taxes. However, her interaction with her accountant is completely different
  than Harry’s.\n\nInstead of handing her accountant a shoebox, or spending time scanning
  and uploading her documents to the accounting firm’s website, Olivia logs into Sharesight
  and with a few clicks, her accountant is sent an email invitation to her portfolio.
  She’s chosen to [give her accountant “Read & Write” access](/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/),
  which means they can make adjustments to things like [corporate actions](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/),
  if necessary.\n\nThe beauty of this solution is that the need to recreate the portfolio
  history is completely eliminated. Plus, the accountant can use Sharesight on their
  own time, independently of Olivia.\n\nEven though the work has essentially been
  done for the accountant by Sharesight, let’s assume they still spend 3 hours on
  her file. This brings the billable amount to $360.\n\n__In this scenario, Olivia
  spent $635 on investment admin for 12 months. So compared to Harry’s spreadsheet
  approach, Sharesight actually decreased her admin-related costs by 59%.__\n\nThere
  are three additional factors that should save Olivia money:\n\n1. First, her __Sharesight
  subscription is most likely tax deductible__.\n2. Second, because Sharesight did
  the admin work for her and the accountant, this should __free up time to conduct
  forward-looking, tax planning discussions__ together &mdash; not just at tax-time,
  but throughout the year.\n3. Finally, because she always [knows the performance](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  of each of her holdings, __Sharesight has probably helped Olivia make better investment
  decisions__. So her subscription fee may have already more than paid for itself!\n\n###
