:title: RewardSuper and Sharesight
:url_slug: rewardsuper-and-sharesight
:content: "RewardSuper is an Australian company that provides great web based tools
  to accountants to automate the labour intensive task of preparing transaction data
  for their clients' accounts. We have been working with RewardSuper on our upcoming
  broker Trade Confirmation Email processing feature where the backend PDF processing
  is handled by their RSTradeweb product. This will enable [Sharesight](/) clients
  to have their share portfolios automatically updated when they buy and sell shares.
  \n\nWe are also working towards a closer integration with RewardSuper to enable
  a secure mechanism for customers to have their detailed Sharesight portfolio data
  flow through to their accountant’s professional accounting systems via RewardSuper’s
  RSDataweb platform.\n\nRewardSuper will be at the Institute of Chartered Accountants
  [Self Managed Superannuation Funds Conference](https://www.charteredaccountantsanz.com)
  in Sydney this Friday 19 March. If you’re attending this event and are interested
  in finding out more about this partnership, please head over to the RewardSuper
  sponsor table."
