  Who is IG Markets?\n\nFounded in 1974, [IG Markets](https://www.ig.com/au) is a
  UK-based broker with an online trading platform that also operates in Australia,
  allowing investors to trade in assets such as shares, ETFs, CFDs and Forex. The
  platform gives investors access to 17,000 global markets, with the ability to trade
  in currencies such as AUD, GBP and USD. Other key features include free trading
  courses and webinars, an interactive forum for IG Markets customers, as well as
  the ability to simulate trades using a demo account.\n\n## Why you should track
  IG Markets trades with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your IG Markets trades to Sharesight,
  you can easily [track your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  across different brokers, asset classes and markets, or leverage Sharesight’s advanced
  performance and tax reporting designed for the needs of self-directed investors.\n\nUnlike
  the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight takes into account the impact of capital
  gains, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/), brokerage fees
  and currency fluctuations when calculating returns – giving investors the full picture
  of their portfolio’s performance. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports
  for investors including [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/),
  [Multi-Currency Valuation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/)
  and [Future Income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/)
  (upcoming dividends). The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/),
  [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio.\n\n## How to import your IG Markets trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to import your historical and ongoing IG Markets trades made in AUD,
  GBP and USD through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  feature, or you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading
  a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  Keep reading to learn more. \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** Sharesight supports price and performance
  tracking for stocks, ETFs and managed funds. We do not support tracking for CFDs.
  \n\n### Help us add support for IG Markets’ global trade confirmations\n\nSharesight

  clients in AUD, GBP and USD. If you would like us to add support for IG Markets
  trade confirmations in more countries, leave us a message in the chat interface
  located at the bottom-right of Sharesight, or let us know at the [Sharesight Community](https://community.sharesight.com/t/do-you-use-a-broker-that-sharesight-does-not-currently-support/284).
