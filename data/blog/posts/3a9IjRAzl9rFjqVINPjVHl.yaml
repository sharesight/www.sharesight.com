:title: The unlisted property trust investing essential guide
:url_slug: the-essential-guide-to-investing-in-unlisted-property-trusts
:content: "There are a number of ways to invest in commercial property, ranging from
  direct investment, private syndicates, ASX-listed real estate investment trusts
  (REITs), to the focus of this article, unlisted property trusts.\n\n## Benefits
  of investing in a trust structure\n\nThere are several key benefits investors gain
  from using trusts, including:\n\n* **Investors’ funds are pooled**, providing access
  to assets they could not otherwise purchase individually, such as large office buildings
  or major shopping centres;\n\n* **Protection via professional management of trust**;\n\n*
  **Internal gearing is non-recourse to investors**, which means if there is a default,
  the issuer of the debt (usually a bank) can seize the collateral but cannot seek
  out the investor for any further compensation. This reduces the risk to each investor
  and makes them suitable for [SMSFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/);\n\n*
  **Regular income stream**, with distributions ranging from monthly to six-monthly
  payments;\n\n* **Investors share in any capital growth**, proportionate to their
  holding in the trust;\n\n* **Potential for tax-deferred income**, increasing after-tax
  returns;\n\n* **Professional management**, covering due diligence, debt, property
  and tenant management;\n\n* **Liquidity** (dependent on the structure used); and\n\n*
  **Only a small investment is required**, allowing investors to diversify across
  properties and managers.\n\n## How does an unlisted property trust work?\n\nUnlisted
  property trusts provide an investment with characteristics most like a direct purchase
  of a commercial property, with the added benefit of professional management.\n\nAs
  unlisted property trusts are generally priced based on the underlying valuation
  of their property assets, the value of the investment is primarily influenced by
  movements in the commercial property market rather than by the broader share market.
  This can mean less volatility in the investment.\n\nThere are two types of unlisted
  property trusts, open-ended property funds and fixed-term, closed-end property trusts
  (often referred to as syndicates).\n\n### Open-end property funds\n\nOpen-end funds
  don’t have a maturity date or a finite number of units. Instead, they can continue
  to issue units so long as they raise money, using the new funds to purchase additional
  properties.\n\nAs there is no specific maturity date, to allow investors to exit
  the investment they must offer some other method of liquidity. Liquidity is usually
  provided by holding a portion of the fund’s assets in cash, using new investors’
  funds to pay out existing investors, or selling assets if necessary. This allows
  investors to exit at regular intervals.\n\nThese funds tend to hold a number of
  assets to increase [diversification](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/investment-diversification-why-does-it-matter/),
  but it is at the manager’s discretion to buy or sell assets, so investors must have
  confidence in their ability to do so successfully.\n\n### Fixed-term, closed-end
  property trusts\n\nSyndicates contain one or more properties that will be held for
  a specified period of time, usually five to ten years. At the end of the specified
  time, investors will vote on the future of the trust, with the default outcome usually
  that the property be sold, the trust wound up and investors paid out.\n\nSyndicates
  should be considered illiquid investments and you need to have an expectation that
  you will remain in the investment for the full term. They are generally fairly easy
  to understand and you know for certain which property (or properties) are owned.
  Therefore, if you don’t like the property in question, you simply don’t have to
  invest.\n\nSingle property syndicates don’t necessarily provide diversification
  on their own, but because the minimum investment is generally as low as $10,000,
  investments in a number of syndicates can be made to provide diversification by
  property, location, sector, maturity date and manager.\n\n### Property Management\n\nA
  key reason for using an unlisted property trust is gaining the expertise of a professional
  property manager. The best property fund managers have an internal property management
  division which looks after the buildings in the trusts it manages. Having this function
  in-house avoids the use of third party agents, and ensures an alignment of interests
  between the manager and investor.\n\nProperty management includes leasing, ongoing
  maintenance of buildings, building concierge services, fire safety and other compliance
  requirements and, most importantly for investors, making sure the rent is collected!\n\n###
  Distributions\n\nThe trust will receive rental payments from tenants and this is
  passed on, less the relevant aforementioned expenses, to unitholders as distributions
  on a regular basis. Depending on the trust, distributions may be paid monthly, quarterly
  or six-monthly. Here are the distributions paid by the Cromwell Australian Property
  Fund, as tracked in [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/):\n\n![unlisted property
  fund distributions](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4RCLB9b3VpiJ0UFXhaqcpl/2b5722911d8517687e068344df9f1738/unlisted_property_fund_distributions.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Costs and fees\n\nThe trust will generally be charged acquisition fees, ongoing
  management fees, property management fees and various other fees by the manager
  depending on the individual trust, its assets and structure. The trust is also likely
  to pay stamp duty for the acquisition of properties plus legal and other costs.\n\nAny
  returns forecast will take these fees and costs into account. [The Australian Securities
  and Investments Commission (ASIC)](https://asic.gov.au/) requires all managers to
  display their fees and costs in a consistent format in the Product Disclosure Statement
  (PDS), which makes it easy to compare the fees between trusts.\n\n### Liquidity\n\n**Fixed-term
  trusts**\n\nThese are essentially illiquid throughout their term. At the end of
  the trust’s term, the property is sold, the trust wound up and investors paid out
  proportionately to the units they hold.\n\n**Open-end funds**\n\nEach open-end property
  fund will have a different liquidity mechanism, but as the underlying property assets
  are illiquid, the ability to exit the fund will have limitations. Common ways of
  providing some liquidity is to hold some of the fund’s assets in cash, using cash
  from incoming investors or, if demand is high and market conditions allow, selling
  assets.\n\n## Reviewing an unlisted property trust\n\nThe manager of an unlisted
  trust will provide you with a lot of information about the trust and its assets
  in the PDS, so [it is important to read and understand](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/media/405392/investing-in-unlisted-property-schemes.pdf)
  it – particularly the ‘Risks’ section. \n\nThis section will include details on
  the manager, distribution yield, property assets – inclusive of all the considerations
  within, such as location, building quality, growth, tenants, lease and green credentials
  – the trust structure, fees, borrowing and more.\n\n## Tracking unlisted property
