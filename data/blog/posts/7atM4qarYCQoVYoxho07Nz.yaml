:title: How to build a long-term portfolio in listed markets
:content: "> The idea that a bell rings to signal when investors should get into or
  out of the market is simply not credible. After nearly 50 years in the business,
  I do not know of anyone who has done it successfully and consistently.<br><cite>Jack
  Bogle, Founder of Vanguard</cite>\n\n> Charlie and I spend no time thinking or talking
  about what the stock market is going to do, because we don’t know. We are not operating
  on the basis of any kind of macro forecast about stocks. There’s always a list of
  reasons why the country will have problems tomorrow.<br><cite>– Warren Buffett</cite>\n\nLet’s
  face it. If the two most distinguished investors of the last 50 years don’t have
  a clue what markets will do, the rest of us are fooling ourselves.\n\nThe finance
  industry makes investing complicated by giving too many false promises. Market experts
  speculate about when to buy and sell shares as if they have special insights, when
  every day there are a multitude of contradicting opinions. Fund managers say they
  will deliver outperformance through their superior knowledge, but they are competing
  against equally-talented analysts and all will struggle to match the index over
  time after fees.\n\nThe result is that many investors chop and change their strategies
  based on guesswork, especially responding to the media tendency to over-hype market
  falls with panicky headlines. A National Seniors Australia Report in 2018 called
  ‘Once Bitten, Twice Shy’ found that 23% of retirees cannot tolerate a loss on their
  retirement savings in any 12-month period, and only 10% could suffer a loss of 10%
  of higher.\n\nYet since the Second World War, there have been 40 times where the
  All Ords Price Index has fallen 10% or more, or about once every two years. Worse,
  it has fallen over 50% three times, in 1987, 1974 and 2007 to 2009. It will happen
  again, and investors should be ready in advance.\n\n![Featured - How to build a
  long-term portfolio in listed markets](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6XexCkvbUPjD8y7rrjJzNU/36a0788579624042d326eb2eef7effaf/featured_how-to-build-a-long-term-portfolio-in-listed-markets.jpg?w=950)\n\nThese
  falls cause investors to panic and sell at the worst time when they can no longer
  accept the pain. Then as the market recovers, they regain confidence and buy at
  higher levels. This regular pattern of buy high/sell low means the average investor
  does not even achieve the market index.\n\nIn any case, we spend too much time on
  selecting stocks. An estimated 90% of the return from a portfolio comes from the
  mix of asset classes, not the share selection. Even if someone has a special talent
  for picking shares, it matters little for the overall portfolio performance if the
  asset allocation between cash, property, bonds, domestic and global shares and other
  alternatives is inappropriate.\n\nA better long-term strategy than jumping in and
  out of markets is to select a portfolio that suits you based on a few simple principles:
  goals, risk appetite, diversification and cost management.\n\n## 1.\tConsider your
  goals\n\nA Millennial saving for a home deposit over five years has a different
  investment profile than a Baby Boomer funding a 30-year retirement. If a reasonable
  assessment of likely returns and savings patterns shows a goal cannot be achieved,
  then it might be necessary to work longer or save more. Each person is different,
  but starting early and tapping into the wonders of compounding will pay off.\n\n##
  2.\tAssess your appetite for investment risk\n\nA test of your risk appetite is
  how well you will sleep at night if your portfolio falls in value. Your risk capacity
  may vary according to:\n\n- Your investment horizon\n- Your age and stage of life\n-
  Your knowledge about investing.\n\nPerhaps take some financial advice to assist
  in assessing your risk profile, then leave your money there and don’t be tempted
  to swap styles.\n\n## 3.\tSelect an asset allocation that matches your risk appetite
  \n\nA broadly-diversified portfolio using a variety of asset classes is a good investment
  solution for the majority of people. Consider the three portfolios below. Choose
  a more conservative mix if you are risk averse or older and worry about the value
  of your investments falling. If you’re under 50, a more aggressive portfolio may
  be suitable since you have time to invest more and better capacity to ride out the
  inevitable share market volatility. \n\nThese portfolios change the allocation from
  ‘growth’ to ‘income’ assets depending on risk appetite. The distinction (growth
  v income) depends on where most of return expected.\n\n### Example asset allocations
  at various risk levels\n\n| &nbsp;     | Conservative     | Balanced     | Aggressive
  \    |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Risk
  horizon</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2 years</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">5
  years</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">8 years</span> |\n| &nbsp;            |
  &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  |\n| Australian shares\t| 6       | 20      | 30      |\n|
  Global shares     | 6       | 20      | 35      |\n| Listed property   | 3       |
  5       | 10      |\n| Australian bonds\t| 30      | 20      | 10      |\n| Global
  bonds      |\t20      |\t10      |\t5       |\n| ‘Alternatives’    |\t5       |\t5
  \      |\t5       |\n| Cash              |\t30      |\t20      |\t5       |\n| <span
  style=\"font-weight:bold;\">TOTAL</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">100</span>
  | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">100</span> | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">100</span>
  |\n| &nbsp;            | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  |\n| Growth Assets     | 20
  \     |\t50      |\t80      |\n| Income Assets     |\t80\t    | 50      |\t20      |\n\n##
  4.\tManage your costs\n\nWhile you cannot control the market, you have more influence
  over what costs you pay. The three major costs to watch are:\n\n- Investment management
  fees\n- Administration fees such the cost of an investment ‘platform’\n- Financial
  advice fees.\n\nOne way to reduce investment management costs is to invest in index
  funds, but this removes the possibility of outperformance from selecting a talented
  manager. Platform fees might be reduced by using securities listed on the ASX, and
  with $40 billion in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and $40 billion in Listed Investment
  Companies (LICs) and Trusts (LITs), there are now plenty to choose from to gain
  the required exposure, as shown below.\n\nThis article focusses on the ASX listed
  market, but there are plenty of institutions who actively manage balanced portfolios
  for a reasonable cost.\n\n## Assembling a portfolio using listed securities\nA complete
  list of investment products on the ASX is [here](https://www.asx.com.au/products/etf/managed-funds-etp-product-list.htm).
  It includes hundreds of ETFs, LICs, LITs, A-REITs, infrastructure funds, unlisted
  funds on the mFund service, and alternatives such as currency, infrastructure, gold
  and absolute return funds. \n\nExposure to the seven asset classes identified in
  the table above can be achieved in many combinations, and the following are among
  the more popular (with their ASX code):\n\n### Cash\n**AAA**: BetaShares Australian
  High Interest Cash ETF<br>\n**MONY**: UBS IQ Cash ETF<br>\n**BILL**: iShares Core
  Cash ETF\n\n### Australian shares\n**A200**: BetaShares Australia 200 ETF<br>\n**STW**:
  SPDR 200 Fund ETF<br>\n**VAS**: Vanguard Australian Shares ETF<br>\n**AFI**: Australian
  Foundation Investment (Active)\n\n### Global shares\n**MGG**: Magellan Global Trust
  (Active)<br>\n**PMC**: Platinum Capital (Active)<br>\n**IVV**: iShares S&P500 ETF<br>\n**VGAD**:
  Vanguard International Shares (Hedged) ETF\n\n### Australian listed property\n**VAP**:
  Vanguard Australian Property Securities Index ETF<br>\n**SLF**: SPDR S&P/ASX200
  Listed Property Fund ETF<br>\n**MVA**: VanEck Vectors Australian Property ETF<br>\n\nPlus
  an enormous range of A-REITs such as WFD: Westfield, SGP: Stockland, MGR:Mirvac
  and CQR: Charter Hall.  \n\n### Australian bonds\n**VAF**: Vanguard Australian Fixed
  Interest ETF<br>\n**BNDS**: BetaShares Legg Mason Australian Bond Fund (Active)<br>\n**FLOT**:
  VanEck Vectors Australian Floating Rate ETF<br>\n**QPON**: BetaShares Australian
  Bank Senior Floating Rate Bond ETF \n\n### Global bonds\n**VBND**: Vanguard Global
  Aggregate Bond Index (Hedged) ETF<br>\n**IHCB**: iShares Core Global Corporate Bond
  ETF\n\n### ‘Alternatives’ \n**HBRD**: BetaShares Active Hybrid Fund (Active)<br>\n**ALI**:
  Argo Global Listed Infrastructure (Active)<br>\n**TOP**: Thorney Opportunities Limited
  (Active)<br>\n**GLIN**: AMP Global Infrastructure (Active) \n\nThere are also infrastructure
  stocks such as SYD: Sydney Airport, TCL: Transurban Group and SKI: Spark Infrastructure
  Group which can be put in the alternatives bucket.\n\n### A sample low cost, balanced
  portfolio using listed securities\nAmong a myriad of choices too numerous to list,
  a sample portfolio based on the above might look like the following table, with
  the management expense ratio (MER) included. The example seeks to minimise fees,
  but this approach is not a recommendation. More important is the net return after
  fees, and if an investor likes an active fund or manager, and believes they can
  outperform and cover their higher fees, it might be a better choice.\n\n| Asset
  Class | Example ASX code | Balanced Allocation | MER|\n| ---------- | ----------
  | ---------- | ---------- |\n| Australian shares | A200              | 20% | 0.07%
  |\n| Global shares\t    | IVV               | 20% | 0.07% |\n| Listed property\t\t|
  VAP               | 5%  | 0.25% |\n| Australian bonds  | BOND              | 20%
  | 0.24% |\n| Global bonds\t\t\t| VBND              | 10% | 0.20% |\n| ‘Alternatives’\t\t|
  Mix of HBRD, GLIN | 5%  | 0.75% |\n| Cash\t            | AAA               | 20%
  | 0.18% |\n| <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">TOTAL</span> | &nbsp; | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">100%</span>
  | <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">0.18%</span>|\n\nThis is a balanced portfolio
  with an annual MER less than 0.2% (20 basis points) plus the cost of brokerage but
  with no separate platform fee.\n\nThe portfolio focuses only on cost, but in a core-satellite
  approach, an active fund manager could be added to give greater outperformance potential.\n\n##
  What about the record-keeping?\nIf the investments are not held on a platform, how
  is the portfolio monitored?\n\nThere are better ways than relying on an Excel [spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/).
  For many years, I have used [Sharesight](/) to monitor my personal portfolio, including
  automatic updates of ASX transactions, comprehensive tax and performance reporting,
  and good visuals. I give my accountant direct access to my account for preparation
  of my personal tax return. \n\nI don’t consider Sharesight an alternative to the
  full-service of a specialist administrator for my SMSF, as that has specific legal
  obligations for me as a trustee and a complexity I want in the hands of SMSF experts.
  But I keep my SMSF records on Sharesight, as well as my personal portfolio, as a
  check.  \n\nSharesight has not paid me to say this. It’s simply a fact that I maintain
  my share records there.  \n\n## Think long term and turn down the noise\nInvesting
  should be part of a multi-decade plan. Turn down the volume of the daily market
  noise and unless you enjoy it or have special skills, don’t waste too much time
  on picking individual shares or trying to time the market. The experts don’t know
  about the near-term direction of the market, and neither do you. It’s the high-level
  asset allocation that will mainly drive your returns.\n\n<br><br>\n<small><i>Graham
