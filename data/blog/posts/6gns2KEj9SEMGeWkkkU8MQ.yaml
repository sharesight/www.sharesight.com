:title: Manage those pesky corporate actions before EOFY
:content: "As we’ve previously written, [corporate actions greatly impact portfolio
  performance](/blog/corporate-actions-and-your-investment-performance/). And because
  your broker doesn’t take corporate actions into account, [their performance numbers
  can mislead you](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/) into thinking
  you’re doing better (or worse) than you actually are. One of our own team members
  realised this recently when her first share split resulted in her broker [completely
  misreporting her performance](/blog/why-i-use-sharesight-to-track-my-portfolio/)
  (down 48% when she was actually up nearly 5%).\n\n![featured - pendulum balls](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3p4DcSWQwE8yyMK286msyk/50776c3905e8e42338da96a218cad83c/featured_pendulum-balls.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Catch-up on complex corporate actions\nFortunately the vast majority of day-to-day
  corporate actions (such as dividends and share splits) are automatically incorporated
  by [Sharesight](/). Having said that, it’s important to review your investment portfolio
  to ensure that you’ve managed some of the trickier corporate actions that may have
  required an action on your part.\n \nHere are some of the year’s most popular corporate
  actions, with step-by-step instructions on how to handle them in Sharesight:\n \n-
  [How to handle the Trustpower demerger](/blog/how-to-handle-the-trustpower-demerger/)\n-
  [How to handle the 2016 Telstra buy back](/blog/how-to-handle-the-2016-telstra-buy-back/)\n-
  [How to handle the Michael Hill restructure](/blog/michael-hill-restructure/)\n-
  [How to handle the Stride Investore restructure](/blog/how-to-handle-the-stride-investore-restructure/)\n\n##
  Be portfolio proactive\nWith the end of Australian financial year (EOFY) less than
  a month away, there’s no better time to do this corporate action “portfolio admin”
  work. Once done, you’ll be free to take a deep dive into your portfolio to understand
  how you *really* performed this year -- and act proactively to maximise returns
  going forward. This can include deciding whether to sell underperforming shares
  in order to minimise or even eliminate a tax liability you might otherwise be facing.
  Sharesight’s [Unrealised Capital Gains Report](/blog/tax-loss-selling-made-easy/)
  displays the short and long term capital gains and losses of all your holdings --
  so it makes it easy to forecast the tax implications of selling before EOFY.\n \nTo
  learn more about how Sharesight handles corporate actions, visit our [Corporate
  Actions](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/) help page. And for help
  with other corporate actions, leave a message on our [community forum](https://community.sharesight.com).\n\n<br><br>\n<small><b>Important
