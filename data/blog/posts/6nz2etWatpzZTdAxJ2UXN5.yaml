:title: Sharesight20 - Top 20 trades on the ASX in 2018
:url_slug: sharesight20--top-20-trades-on-the-asx-in-2018
:content: "Our Sharesight20 snapshots of the [top 20 trades on the ASX and NZX markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20/)
  by Sharesight users always make for interesting reading. In this post we’re going
  to explore the top 20 trades on the ASX in 2018 and build a Sharesight portfolio
  of these 20 shares to find out how it would have performed during the year.\n\n##
  Sharesight20 top 20 ASX trades 2018\n\n![Top 20 ASX trades 2018](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6Xo4spn1BCjA7dMn1zFl3g/8d01ccb6edfdb2ec20438077cf44f712/Top_20_ASX_trades_2018.png?w=950)\n\n**After
  a turbulent year, and announcing a major shake up of operations, Telstra claimed
  the title of the most-traded ASX stock by Sharesight users in 2018.** The second
  most traded stock was VAS (Vanguard’s Australian Shares ETF which seeks to track
  the return of the S&P/ASX 300 Index), followed by NAB in third place.\n\nInterestingly,
  the Sharesight20 2018 snapshot of the top 20 trades on the NZX saw ETFs dominate
  the top 3 spots, whereas only 2 ETFs made the top 20 trades on the ASX. As mentioned
  above, VAS held the number 2 position, and VGS (Vanguards International Shares)
  just barely made the top 10 by being the 9th most-traded holding.\n\nLet’s explore
  how the investment returns a portfolio built from these 20 stocks would have performed
  \ in 2018 before we dive in to some of the news behind the interest in these stocks.\n\n##
  Sharesight20 ASX 2018 portfolio performance\n\nIf you held a portfolio of these
  20 stocks on the ASX in 2018 (5% weighting each) you would have seen a respectable
  **total return of 8.17% in 2018, with 5.24% of that return from dividends.** Here’s
  how each stock in the portfolio performed:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n      <th colspan=\"5\">Sharesight20ASX
