:title: Cash Accounts now sync transactions with your portfolio
:content: "Tracking your trading cash account as part of your Sharesight portfolio
  has been a highly demanded feature by our users. We released our [Cash Account feature
  in 2018](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-cash-accounts-in-sharesight/), as
  well as [additional improvements in 2019](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/improved-portfolio-trading-cash-account-tracking/),
  \ and have just released another update that automates the previously manual data
  entry required to record dividend/distribution payouts in your Cash Account.\n\n![Cash
  Accounts](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1FJE3ieOfzjw89Tfe3ugCn/26b01fd4ca8dfa315a4d31a61ca9357c/Cash_Accounts.jpg?w=950)\n\nYou
  can now elect to have one of your [Sharesight Cash Accounts](https://help.sharesight.com/creating-a-cash-account/)
  be your nominated trading Cash Account (as long as the Cash Account currency matches
  your portfolio currency).\n\nNow, you can elect to have the following transactions
  from your portfolio automatically synced to your Cash Account:\n\n* Buy and sell
  trades.\n\n* Payouts (dividends and distributions).\n\n## Why track your trading
  cash account?\n\nA Cash Account helps you monitor the movement of your money (cash
  flow) into and out of your portfolio, and allows you to see your investable cash
  at any given moment. This gives you the complete picture of your investments *including*
  the value of cash you have on hand that is not fully invested.\n\nFor more information
  on the role of cash in a portfolio, refer to the [blog](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-the-role-of-cash-in-an-investment-portfolio/)
  on the topic written earlier.\n\n## How to set up a Cash Account in Sharesight\n\nThe
  \"Add Cash Account\" button is on the Portfolio Overview page. From there you can
  specify the name and currency of the Cash Account which will be tied to the portfolio
  (including its [tax residency](https://help.sharesight.com/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/)).\n\n![Cash

  you have [added transactions to the account](https://help.sharesight.com/adding-a-transaction-to-a-cash-account/),
  the balance of the Cash Account will appear at a glance on the Portfolio Overview
  page.\n\n![Cash Account Balance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6r6SoxLoNjwu33NY5iK7PN/09f81a6e1e6ef840524052f75af7e482/Cash_Account_Balance.png?w=950)\n\n![Trading

  Sharesight’s new and improved Cash Account feature, you can now elect to have one
  of your manual Cash Accounts linked to your portfolio as a trading Cash Account
  (as long as the Cash Account currency matches your portfolio currency).\n\nTo enable
  this feature, go to your \"Settings\" -> “Basic details” in your Sharesight portfolio.
  You have the ability to set the following parameters.\n\n1. Select the Cash Account
  to which you want your buy and sell trades to sync with.\n\n2. Select the Cash Account
  to which you want the payouts to sync with. In this example, I have selected the
  same Cash Account to sync both. You can choose to sync them to two separate accounts.\n\n\n![Sync

  Syncing historical transact to your Cash Account\n\nAfter you have linked your Cash
  Account to a portfolio you can then sync historical transactions from your portfolio
  automatically by clicking on 'Manage Synced Trades' when viewing your Cash Account.
  You can then choose the date to sync trades from automatically.\n\nFor example,
  by selecting a date of 07/04/2010, you can get all transactions after that date
  to sync with the Cash Account then clicking \"Sync all trades\". \n\n![Sync transactions

  can expect to view the cash records in the nominated Cash Account as below: \n\n![Cash
  Account transaction history](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5pp9OKaDwXPysUGfIigybf/0a44226174c86ad82a9ba8d07794ce05/Cash_Account_transaction_history.png?w=950)\n\nPlease
  note that only the [dividend payouts that have been confirmed](https://help.sharesight.com/confirming-multiple-unconfirmed-transactions/)
  for each holding will appear in the Cash Account here.\n\n## Cash Account notes\n\n######
  The value of your Cash Account is included when calculating your portfolio’s value,
  but does not impact the [percentage return figure](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/).\n\nYou
  can only use this feature with Sharesight’s built-in Cash Account feature. Due to
  the way [Xero connected cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/) and [Macquarie
  cash accounts](https://help.sharesight.com/adding-a-macquarie-cash-management-account/)
  push data into Sharesight automatically, these accounts sync automatically already.
  \ \n\nClicking on a Cash Account transaction that has been created from a synced
  trade will bring up the trade \"edit\" form. Cash Account transactions will update
  automatically when the trade is edited. As these transactions are linked, it is
  not possible to edit the cash transaction separately from the underlying trade.\n\n*
  The Cash Account’s currency has to match the currency of your portfolio.\n\n* Updating
  a linked payout will result in an update to the Cash transaction value.\n\n* Deleting
  a linked payout will delete the corresponding linked cash transaction.\n\n* If the
  Payout cash account is the same as the Trade cash account then the 'Manage Synced
  Trades' label on the cash account screen will read 'Managed Synced Trades & Payouts'.\n\n*
  If the Payout cash account is the same as the Trade cash account then the 'Sync
  all trades' button on the Manage Synced Trades modal will read 'Sync all trades
  & payouts'.\n\n* If the Payout cash account is not the same as the Trade cash account
  then the existing 'Manual Synced Trades' will read 'Manage Synced Payouts'.\n\n*
  If the Payout cash account is not the same as the Trade cash account then the 'Sync
  all trades' button on the Manage Synced Trades modal will read 'Sync all payouts'.\n\n*
  Deleting the payout cash account should delete all the corresponding cash transactions
  and remove the link to each payout.\n\n* If a payout has been reinvested then it
  will not be linked to a cash transaction.\n\n* Net dividend amount for FX payouts
  will be calculated using the exchange rates at the time of the payout.\n\n## Upgrade
