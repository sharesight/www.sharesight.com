  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIn this Sharesight20
  yearly trading snapshot we look at the 20 most traded stocks by Sharesight users
  on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2019 and examine how they performed during
  the year.\n\nLet’s dive into 2019’s top 20 trades.\n\n## Sharesight20 top 20 NYSE

  Click image to zoom</small>\n\nInvestors using Sharesight bought The Walt Disney
  Company (NYSE: DIS) significantly more than any other stock listed on the NYSE in
  2019. Disney had a strong year, [acquiring rival 20th Century Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_21st_Century_Fox_by_Disney)
  in March before launching [Netflix rival Disney+ in November](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%2B).\n\nNow
  let’s look at the performance of these stocks in 2019.\n\n## Top 20 NYSE trades
  in 2019 - performance\n\nTo calculate the performance of these stocks during 2019
  we built a Sharesight portfolio domiciled in the same country as the exchange (to
  remove the impact of currency fluctuations) that contained these 20 stocks and invested
  an equally weighted (5% of the total portfolio) amount in each stock on January
  1st 2019 (or the first listed date for stocks that listed after that date).\n\nWe
  then ran [Sharesight’s ](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)[Performance
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/) to calculate the portfolio’s
  2019 performance. Here’s the results, ordered by Total Return.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n

  ecommerce giant Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) was the standout performer with returns of
  187.17% in 2019. The top dividend performer was AT&T (NYSE: T) with a dividend yield
  of 7.15%.\n\nOverall an equally weighted portfolio of these 20 stocks would have
  returned 33.91%, which only very slightly outperformed an ETF tracking the S&P 500
  such as Vanguard’s (NYSE: VOO) which returned 31.14%.\n\n \n\n## Track your investment
