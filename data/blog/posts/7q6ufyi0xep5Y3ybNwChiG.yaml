:title: Top 20 trades on the ASX in 2019 - Sharesight20
:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only

  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIn this Sharesight20
  yearly trading snapshot we look at the 20 most traded stocks by Sharesight users
  on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 2019 and how these stocks performed
  during the year.\n\nLet’s dive into 2019’s top 20 trades.\n\n## Sharesight20 top
  20 ASX trades in 2019\n\n![Top20 ASX stocks 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1v1a3ul15iuwR1ScLjfQfJ/9fd3475716e2e5e2777cdfc79cfc5282/Top20__ASX_stocks_2019.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
  Click image to zoom</small>\n\nInvestors using Sharesight overwhelmingly bought
  the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS) that seeks to track the S&P/ASX
  300 index. Following closely behind in the total number of trades was Buy Now, Pay
  Later growth stock Afterpay Limited (ASX: APT). In a similar result to our snapshot
  of the [top 20 trades on the NZX in 2019](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/top-20-trades-on-the-nzx-in-2019--sharesight20/)
  - 5 of the 20 were exchange-traded funds.\n\n## Top 20 ASX trades in 2019 - performance\n\nTo
  calculate the performance of these stocks during 2019 we built a Sharesight portfolio
  domiciled in the same country as the exchange (to remove the impact of currency
  fluctuations) that contained these 20 stocks and invested an equally weighted (5%
  of the total portfolio) amount in each stock on January 1st 2019 (or the first listed
  date for stocks that listed after that date).\n\nWe then ran [Sharesight’s Performance
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/) to calculate the portfolio’s
  2019 performance. Here’s the results, ordered by Total Return.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n

  \   <th>37.89%</th>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThe significant number of Sharesight
  users who already hold Afterpay Limited (ASX: APT) will probably not be surprised
  to see it was the top performer in 2019 - delivering a stellar 136.32% return over
  the year.\n\nWith dividend income a focus for many Australian investors, particularly
  those running SMSFs, it’s perhaps not a surprise that more than half of these 20
  most traded ASX stocks delivered dividend returns greater than 5% in 2019. BHP Group
  Limited (ASX: BHP) and Wesfarmers Limited (ASX: WES) were particular standouts here,
  paying dividends returning 13.94% and 12.31% respectively.\n\nOverall an equally
  weighted portfolio of these 20 stocks would have returned 37.89%, which would have
  quite significantly outperformed an ETF tracking the ASX 300 index like Vanguard’s
  (ASX: VAS) which returned 24.50%, but would have been slightly outperformed by Betashares
  Nasdaq 100 tracking ETF (ASX: NDQ) which returned 39.34%.\n\n \n\n## Track your
