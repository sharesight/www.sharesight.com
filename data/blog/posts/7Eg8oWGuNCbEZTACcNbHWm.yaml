:title: 4 ways to navigate market volatility with Sharesight
:content: "###### Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and
  does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and
  should not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser or
  accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nLike many investors
  right now, I’m watching the value of my portfolio fall, but as a buy and hold investor
  who prefers quality businesses, I’m on the hunt for value. As JP Morgan said: \"in
  bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners.\"\n\nHowever before you pull
  the trigger on any new holdings, it’s important to take a step back and analyse
  what’s going on with your portfolio. And unfortunately your broker’s reports or
  a spreadsheet won’t cut it.\n\nExperienced investors understand that now is the
  time to put your trust in an award-winning solution like Sharesight that is purpose-built
  for their needs.\n\n![4 ways to navigate market volatility sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4eVWjPl6JQ4gmhZadEckVw/2d3ddf0605e2d46ad9cb81c1038c656e/4_ways_to_navigate_market_volatility_sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\nHere
  are four ways Sharesight can help you navigate the market *right now*:\n\n## Detailed
  performance reports\n\nGiven the markets at the moment, most of us are looking at
  short term capital losses. That’s why understanding the impact and contribution
  that dividends provide to your portfolio is really important. If you’ve been investing
  in a holding for a while, the impact of dividends over that period may soften the
  blow of the capital losses you’re currently seeing. Take a look at the summary on
  the [Portfolio Overview Page](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/) or the
  [Taxable Income Report ](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/)in Sharesight
  for more information.\n\n![Dividends](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6zlHeMmKNGbP937UckEyou/e090734d2360c31f4f156e43b6405b15/Dividends.jpg?w=950)\n\nDon’t
  forget about foreign currency. If you’re an Australian investor looking at a safe
  harbour stock such as Microsoft, you need to understand the FX impact on your cost
  base. Sharesight breaks out the currency impact on your return on the Overview Page
  and it’s also detailed in the [All Trades Report](https://help.sharesight.com/trades_report/).\n\n![Currency
  Gain](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/Qg5waw2SXiWvg5IS2eFPP/851d1016d98449fbe9a8b8fe247ddd7d/Currency_Gain.jpg?w=950)\n\nPersonally,
  I rely on the [Contribution Analysis Report](https://help.sharesight.com/contribution-analysis-report/)
  because it gives me a relative feel for how all of the drivers of my performance
  interplay with one another.\n\n![Contribution Analysis](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2zSUBn1sDbQulL6JRgGiM2/6cd3489c9183f11128adaad71cac8345/Contribution_Analysis.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Benchmarking\n\nMany investors compare their portfolio returns to the market index
  in their investing country. That’s a sensible check-up. Just know that when you
  see market performance quoted on TV or in the financial news, you’re looking at
  a basic \"price return\" chart, which won’t match the real money experience of investors.\n\nIt’s
  important to compare your portfolio with an apples-to-apples benchmark. This is
  how the [Sharesight benchmarking](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)
  feature works because it assumes a common investment date, amount, and fees.\n\nPersonally,
  I use benchmarking as a \"plan B\" to the decisions I’ve made as an investor --
  not just as a check on the market. I evaluate my benchmark as a realistic alternative
  to my actively managed decisions.\n\n![Benchmark](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7wEuokpZ0pfaM1i9GUtyYa/af82b5740092060d3c36ba3c5dad4445/Benchmark.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Use capital losses to your advantage\n\nThis depends on what your country is (for
  tax purposes), but in many places capital losses can be used to offset either capital
  gains or even ordinary income.\n\nThe Sharesight [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/capital_gains/)
  (available in Australia and Canada) will show you both long and short term capital
  gains and losses, while the [Unrealised Capital Gains Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  (Australia only) does the same but for unsold positions -- think of this like a
  \"what-if I sold these shares\" report.\n\nPersonally: I check my capital losses
  to see how long something has been a loser - I'm trying to not hold on to poor performers
  for too long.\n\n![UCGT2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4qRAKFNaaWJJOxILBaHe5r/414170e934c534900b9a3bc44c40bc89/UCGT2.png?w=950)\n<small>Sharesight’s
  Unrealised CGT report</small>\n\n## Portfolio sharing\n\nThe best investors are
  informed investors. If you’re wanting a second opinion on your portfolio, start
  the conversation by sharing access with a trusted advisor, family member, or friend.
  This is [available to all plan types in the Settings > Portfolio Sharing menu](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-portfolio-sharing-now-on-all-plans-even-free/).\n\nPersonally,
  I’ve (re)shared my portfolio with my wife. While I act as household portfolio manager,
  I’m using Sharesight to help illustrate the recent market volatility -- and ensure
  she understands it’s not entirely my fault!\n\n![Portfolio Sharing Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/49T6a8eZTs47qIYZe5DafB/f256585fbfab241c38fb5e235f2020d2/Portfolio_Sharing_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n##
