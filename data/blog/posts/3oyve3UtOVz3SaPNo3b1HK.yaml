:title: Quickly view the performance of any stock with the Share Checker
:content: "Sharesight’s [Share Checker](https://help.sharesight.com/share-checker/)
  is the perfect tool for investors who need a quick, easy way to view the price and
  performance of over 170,000 global stocks, ETFs and managed/mutual funds tracked
  by Sharesight. While it is possible to look up stocks through your broker or apps
  like Google Finance, you’re only getting half the information you need. With the
  Share Checker you can view a stock’s performance over the time period of your choice,
  inclusive of [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/) and other
  key performance metrics that other platforms omit from their calculations. \n\n![Share

  Why should investors use the Share Checker?\n\nUsing the [Share Checker](https://help.sharesight.com/share-checker/),
  investors can look up the price of stocks in [36 major global markets](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)
  to see how a hypothetical investment of $10,000 would have performed in their portfolio
  over a range of different time periods. This can be a very useful research tool
  for DIY investors who evaluate buying opportunities by researching stocks’ past
  performance. \n\nThe Share Checker provides the following information at a glance:\n\n*
  A historical price chart, including corporate actions such as share splits and dividends\n\n*
  The country in which the stock is domiciled\n\n* Sector, industry and [custom grouping](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  classifications\n\n* The investment type (stock, ETF, managed/mutual fund, etc.)\n\n*
  The EPS, NTA and P/E ratio (for stocks on the ASX and NZX)\n\nAnd as with all performance
  calculations in Sharesight, the Share Checker displays the stock’s [total annualised
  return](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/),
  including the impact of capital gains or losses, dividends and foreign exchange
  rates – key metrics that can have a significant impact on returns. \n\nThis can
  be clearly seen in the screenshot example below, which shows the performance of
  Apple  in a non-US portfolio over the past year. For instance, under these conditions
  the stock would have a 40.75% return, with capital gains contributing 53%, dividends
  contributing 0.95% and currency gain contributing -13.2%.\n\n![Check price apple

  investors interested in a stock’s dividend history, clicking on the ‘Dividends’
  tab will bring up a list of paid dividends during the chosen period, including information
  such as franking credits; TFN withholding tax; non-resident withholding tax; tax
  credits and deductions; and exchange rates, depending on the [tax residency](https://help.sharesight.com/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/)
  of the portfolio. The screenshot below for example, shows the dividend history of
  Apple over the past year from the perspective of a non-US portfolio. \n\n![Check

  more information on a stock’s performance, investors can also access tabs showing
  corporate actions and related news. \n\n## How to use Sharesight’s Share Checker\n\n1.
