:title: 'Working on your core: Can specialist products survive?'
:url_slug: can-specialist-products-survive
:content: "In Cupertino, California a group of Apple employees sat around a table
  and said: \"we could totally do that, hell we could do it even better!\"\n\nI guarantee
  you this happened. In this case, \"that\" is [GoPro](https://gopro.com).\n\nFor
  those of you unaware (or without teenagers) GoPro sells durable, wearable HD video
  cameras. They're perfect for strapping to a surfboard, attaching to a helmet while
  snowboarding, or [lashing to the back of a golden retriever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IedKWAQszMA).\n\nAnd
  that's all they do. A simple piece of hardware with one button that takes reliable
  video, which is then made available via streaming Wi-Fi, memory card upload, or
  their app for sharing.\n\nGoPro has turned this simple business into a debt-free
  listed company, which earned $1.4B in revenue last year. If you subscribed to their
  IPO in June of last year, you'd be up 68%.\n\n![GoPro Share Price](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6lpjv4HFkcs4cyesUSGeyO/fe85a5415fea118040c4da995e316c1d/share-price_gopro_31.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  truth of the matter is, Apple could do \"that\". In spades. Their version of a GoPro
  would be a beautiful piece of hardware that linked with your Apple-made device,
  like an iWatch. Apple already turns out millions of cameras a year for their iPhones,
  iPads, and MacBooks.\n\nWhether or not Apple will do \"that\" is the billion dollar
  question. Standalone cameras aren't their focus, and outdoorsy active types aren't
  their core audience. A company that made $183B in revenue last year (mostly from
  selling mobiles) might have a hard time convincing their board and investors that
  jumping into a new market that could only ever represent a minuscule revenue pop
  is worthwhile.\n\nTelevisions or who knows, even an Apple Car might be their next
  big idea. But Apple has proven the naysayers wrong before. If they were really keen
  on the lifestyle camera market they might end up just acquiring GoPro outright.\n\nIn
  a similar vein, [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/home) recently announced plans for
  an [IPO](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-07/fitbit-files-for-u-s-ipo-of-fitness-tracking-device-maker).
  They're looking to raise $150M off the back of &nbsp;$745M in sales last year (11M
  devices sold).\n\nFitbit was one of the first and most popular of the fitness wearables.
  Essentially a glorified pedometer and distance tracker that synced with your mobile.
  I've had two, both were great because they were simple. I didn't need an interface
  and they weren't as cumbersome as a full-featured watch.\n\n![Fitbit - Featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3YIgedJcFiI4QS2UuoIwCW/1190dffa48d77c4337c3395dfebcb91c/featured_fitbit.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  questions on my mind, however, is can Fitbit maintain its beautiful simplicity with
  the added pressure from shareholders? Will their product engineers get distracted
  by all that cash in the bank and start building superfluous features? If a Fitbit
  dog collar appears on the market, they're doomed.\n\nParadoxically, their simplicity
  and lack of features made them stand out from the pack. After all, nowadays, every
  phone has fitness-tracker apps and the smartwatch market is set to explode. \n\nIn
  fact, there's already been a casualty in the wearable fitness industry: Nike. Yes,
  the same sports giant that made $28B last year. By [all accounts](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3029400/why-nike-is-probably-killing-off-the-fuelband)
  they're giving up on the their FuelBand. Even with all their money and brains, a
  half-baked device branded Nike, is still a half-baked device.\n\nAs long as GoPro
  and Fitbit stick to their knitting they _should_ have promising futures. Tapping
  into a network of similar devices and applications via APIs could fortify their
  position. If I had to pick one to invest in, I'd go with GoPro. People go out of
  their way to capture experiences with video, whereas I'm not too particular about
  what kind of device tracks my activity. Fitbits and iWatches are a little too similar
  for my comfort.\n\nThe Apple cometh!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Blog -- [Where
