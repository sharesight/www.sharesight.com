:title: The importance of using a purpose-built application
:url_slug: the-importance-of-using-a-purpose-built-application
:content: "Back in the day big businesses built big software with big price tags.
  With scores of developers, the temptation to stray from a core feature set was too
  great.\n\nWant a terrific example of an epic fail?\n\nIn 2000, Enron (yes, that
  [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal)) teamed up with Blockbuster
  (yes, that [Blockbuster](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/blockbuster-ceo-passed-up-chance-to-buy-netflix-for-50-million-2015-7))
  to offer [a broadband service](https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/20/mu4.html). Enron
  spent $350M on servers alone. Of course, they eventually filed for the largest bankruptcy
  in US history and its former CEO is due to be released from prison in 2028. Blockbuster
  also went bankrupt. Their business model seemed to be pretending Netflix didn’t
  exist. So that didn’t go so well.\n\nIn our industry, we’ve seen $20,000-a-year
  investment software offer CRMs, self-publishing tools, and even instant messaging.
  It’s not a pretty sight. Nobody uses these features and they give rise to bloatware.\n\nRecently,
  Reckon, an accounting software provider, created a stir amongst its client base
  by [announcing](https://community.reckon.com.au/reckon/topics/stock_price_download_no_longer_active_as_of_1_august)
  they will no longer provide downloadable share price data on their Reckon Accounts
  Personal Product. Reckon made this decision due to a “forced technology change,”
  and is asking clients to move to a new product to retain this functionality. \n\nWhile
  this is a bummer for their clients who’ve relied on this feature for years, this
  announcement shouldn’t come as too much of a shock. Reckon provides accounting software,
  not investment software. We’ve seen their latest release in action - it’s very cool.
  Their focus is most likely on providing mission-critical accounting features for
  small businesses, accountants, and individuals.\n\nIf they’re concentrating their
  efforts on core features, this is a win for their client base - so long as they
  adopt an open platform architecture and allow their users to connect to purpose-built
  applications. Look no further than the app store on your mobile as to why this structure
  is so effective.\n\n[![Shark Laser - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4nT7TAer1YIuG8MQGY2mca/7b3915ba5864e34da801ed89003f8293/featured_shark-laser.png?w=950)](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/f2eb/)\n\n_Shark
  With Frickin' Laser Pointer_ from [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/f2eb/)\n\nAny
  software provider focusing on a set of core features will never be able to keep
  up with speciality apps on the periphery - especially a software provider who's
  not in the cloud. This is something we remind ourselves of constantly at [Sharesight](/).
  We get well-intended feedback on a range of ideas from technical charting to document
  storage to becoming an online broker ourselves. Some of these ideas would generate
  revenue in the short-term. All of these features would hurt our core application
  over time. We’re never going to do any of these better than dedicated providers
  unless we fundamentally change our business.\n\nOur aim is to connect to these services
  via APIs and let our clients choose which apps to use. In this way, sometimes Sharesight
  is the platform and sometimes we’re the add on.\n\n***Before relying on an application
  to provide important life-admin tasks, make sure you understand what its core functionality
  is. While any application might serve your immediate needs well, there's no guarantee
  that they'll continue to provide the feature. Products change, competitors change,
  technology changes. Sometimes the best way to grow is to kill-off peripheral features.***\n\nTo
  put it another way, trust Sharesight to track and store your portfolio data, but
  by all means don’t use our file uploader as a free alternative to Dropbox.\n\n###
