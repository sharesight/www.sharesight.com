  What is Independent Reserve?\n\nEstablished in 2013, [Independent Reserve](https://www.independentreserve.com/)
  is a digital currency exchange that allows investors to trade in cryptocurrencies
  such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), which are also [supported
  by Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/).
  Based in Australia, the exchange serves investors worldwide, allowing them to trade
  in cryptos using Australian, New Zealand, US and Singapore dollars. \n\n## Why you
  should track Independent Reserve trades with Sharesight\n\nBy syncing your Independent
  Reserve cryptocurrency trades to Sharesight, you can easily [track your investment
  performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  in crypto, stocks, ETFs and managed/mutual funds across different brokers and markets,
  and take advantage of Sharesight’s advanced performance and tax reporting designed
  for the needs of self-directed investors.\n\nBuilt for the needs of global investors,
  Sharesight takes into account the impact of capital gains, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/),
  brokerage fees and currency fluctuations when calculating returns – giving investors
  the full picture of their portfolio’s performance. Sharesight also offers a range
  of powerful reports for investors including [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),

  (upcoming dividends). The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/)
  and [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio.\n\n## How to import your Independent Reserve trades
  to Sharesight\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** It is also possible to import your historical
  crypto trades via [spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  however enabling the Trade Confirmation Emails feature is the most convenient way
  to sync your crypto trades to your portfolio. \n\n<details>\n<summary>What if I
  trade cryptocurrencies not supported by Sharesight?</summary>\n<br>\n<h2>What if
  I trade cryptocurrencies not supported by Sharesight?</h2>\n<p>If you trade cryptocurrencies
  other than the 8 that are <a href=\"https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/\">supported
  by Sharesight</a>, you can still track your investments by adding a <a href=\"https://help.sharesight.com/unquoted-instruments/\">Custom
  Investment</a> into your Sharesight portfolio.\n\nTo add a Custom Investment, simply
  click ‘Add New Holding’ on the Portfolio Overview or Holdings page, and select ‘Add
