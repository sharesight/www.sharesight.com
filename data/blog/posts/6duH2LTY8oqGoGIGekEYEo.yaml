:title: Xero shares listing solely on the ASX - a guide
:content: "Xero Limited announced in 2017 plans to delist from the New Zealand Stock
  Exchange (NZX) and list solely on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), consolidating
  Xero’s listing on a single exchange rather than spreading it across the two markets.\n\nWith
  over 1,500 [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com) clients invested in Xero Limited
  (and [Sharesight being an award-winning Xero partner](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-wins-xero-add-partner-year/))
  we’ve compiled everything you need to know about Xero’s upcoming corporate action.\n\n##
  Why is Xero Limited no longer listing shares on the NZX?\n\nXero has [officially
  cited](https://www.xero.com/about/investors/listing/) four reasons they are delisting
  from the NZX:\n\n1. Access to a larger market (debatable) \n2. Increased liquidity
  (a larger number of buyers and sellers on a single market)\n3. Increased relevance
  to a range of larger investors through inclusion in ‘major ASX indices’ (in particular
  the ASX 200)\n4. Broader analyst and broker coverage (press coverage around the
  move will spike interest from investors)\n\nOf the four reasons cited, probably
  the most important (given [statements from Xero CEO Rod Drury](http://www.afr.com/business/xero-to-join-asx200-after-delisting-from-new-zealand-20171108-gzhnih))
  reason for consolidating Xero shares on the ASX is that the company is likely to
  be promoted from the S&P ASX 300 index to the ASX 200 index -- which could attract
  an increased number of institutional investors, including anyone holding ETFs that
  track the ASX 200.\n\n## Important details for the Xero ASX sole-listing in 2018\n\n###
  What is the final date XRO.NZX will list on the NZX?\n\n31st of January 2018 is
  the last day Xero shares will trade on the NZX. All trades will be settled over
  the following two days (1st/2nd February) before being transferred to the ASX.\n\n###
  When will XRO trade solely on the ASX?\n\nXero Limited shares will trade solely
  on the ASX from the 5th of February.\n\n### How many XRO.ASX shares do owners of
  XRO.NZX receive?\n\nThe shares will be transferred on a 1:1 basis. So all existing
  holders of Xero shares on the NZX will receive an equal number of shares when they
  are transferred to the ASX.\n\n### What will Xero’s share price be on the ASX?\n\nThat’s
  something the market will decide. But if the Xero board is correct this move should
  be a positive for investors. \n\n###### Make sure to read Xero’s [dedicated help
  page](https://www.xero.com/about/investors/listing/) for investors to better understand
  how you will be affected by this change.\n\n## How to handle the Xero NZX to ASX
  transition in Sharesight\n\nSharesight will continue to follow this corporate action
  closely and will be publishing a dedicated Xero sole-listing help page when the
  final details are available in early February. Investors will be able to handle
  this transaction through [Sharesight’s Merge Holding feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-merge-holding-feature/)
  once the trading price on the first day of listing is known.\n\nWe will update this
  post with a link to the help page as soon as it becomes available.\n\n### FURTHER
