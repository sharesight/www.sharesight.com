:content: "Investors trading with [M1 Finance](https://www.m1finance.com/) can automatically
  import historical and ongoing trades to their Sharesight portfolio, making it easier
  than ever for US investors to leverage Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend
  tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/) and tax reporting features.
  \n\nWith support for [more than 170 global brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  and automatically updated price and dividend information on [over 170,000 stocks,
  ETFs and mutual/managed funds](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),

  of their investments** in one place. \n\n![image 0 M1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/21ERDcymahLAY1F7jfbHy7/b641cbac9df8d27dc1d956d1676bbc49/image_0_M1.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is M1 Finance?\n\n[M1 Finance](https://www.m1finance.com/) is a US-based financial
  services company with an online brokerage platform that allows investors to build
  a portfolio of stocks and ETFs with no brokerage fees. M1 gives investors access
  to major US markets including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NYSE Arca, NYSE
  American and Nasdaq, which [Sharesight also supports](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  One of M1’s main features is its automated trading system, which allows investors
  to automatically rebalance their portfolio based on their chosen asset allocation.
  Sharesight supports M1 Finance in addition to other US brokers that use [Apex Clearing
  Corporation](https://www.apexclearing.com/) to process trades, such as [Ally Invest](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/easily-import-trades-from-ally-invest-to-sharesight/).\n\n##
  Why you should track M1 Finance trades with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your trades
  with M1 Finance to Sharesight, you can easily [track your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  across multiple brokers and asset classes, or take advantage of Sharesight’s advanced
  performance and tax reporting designed for the needs of self-directed investors.
  \n\nUnlike the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight gives investors the true
  picture of their investment performance by taking into account the impact of brokerage
  fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and capital gains on their returns. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports
  for investors including [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/), [Contribution
  Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  and [Future Income](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/) (upcoming dividends).
  The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/),
  [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio. \n\n## How to import your M1 Finance trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight

  feature, or you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading
  a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
