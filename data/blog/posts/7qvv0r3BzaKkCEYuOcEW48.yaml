:title: Time-Weighted vs Money-Weighted Rates of Return
:url_slug: time-weighted-vs-money-weighted-rates-of-return
:content: "We often get asked the difference between time-weighted versus money-weighted
  (or dollar-weighted) returns when calculating portfolio performance. So in this
  blog, we’re going to dive into the differences between the two, and why Sharesight
  uses the money-weighted method in calculating your [portfolio performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/).\n\n![Time
  or money weighted returns](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6CNhYifWydzG6i3TFHU3s1/c75e2f4c936a54d382029a0384510efe/Time_or_money_weighted_returns.jpg?w=950)\n\n###
  First, let’s briefly define both before going into more detail:\n\n__Time-Weighted:__
  Time-weighted rates of return __do not__ take into account the impact of cash flows
  into and out of the portfolio.\n\n__Money-Weighted:__ Money-weighted rates of return
  __do__ take into account the impact of cash flows into and out of the portfolio.\n\nNow
  let’s explore the reasons why these differences matter, the use cases for each,
  and why Sharesight uses one calculation but not the other when [calculating the
  performance of your investment portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/).\n\n##
  Time-weighted rates of return\n\nTime-weighted rates of return attempt to remove
  the impact of cash flows when calculating the return. This makes it ideal for calculating
  the performance of broad market indices or the impact of a fund manager on the performance
  of an investment. Time-weighting is important in this context as fund managers do
  not control the timing of cash flows into and out of their fund – investors control
  that – so it is not reasonable to include that effect when evaluating the performance
  of the fund manager.\n\nThe definition for Time-weighted rate of return ([from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/quantitative-methods/discounted-cash-flow-time-weighted-return.asp))\n\n*“(Time-weighted
  rate of return) is defined as the compounded growth rate of $1 over the period being
  measured. The time-weighted formula is essentially a geometric mean of a number
  of holding-period returns that are linked together or compounded over time (thus,
  time-weighted).*\n\nIf your eyes glazed over while reading that definition, don’t
  worry. At its core a time-weighted rate of return breaks the portfolio performance
  across the time period being measured into smaller ‘sub-periods’ whenever there
  is an inflow or outflow for the portfolio. Then the performance of each sub-period
  is calculated, before being linked to find the ‘[geometric mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/geometricmean.asp)’
  performance across the entire period.\n\n![Time-Weighted Return](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1p7flX9eTO4EsoUwKcasys/05c2642c27acd44414298dbc765029ad/sharesight_time-weighted-return.png?w=950)\n\nIf
  cash flows into or out of the portfolio during a sub-period, the period is broken
  down into smaller periods at this point to calculate the performance for each intra-period
  before then being combined to calculate performance for the sub-period.\n\n## Money-weighted
  rates of return\n\nUnlike a time-weighted methodology, which removes the impact
  of cash flows when calculating your rate of return, money-weighted rates of return
  calculate investment performance taking account both the __size__ and __timing__
  of cash flows in and out of an investment portfolio, placing a __greater weight__
  on periods when the __portfolio size is largest__.\n\n![Money-Weighted Return](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5FjMegWtVK6QIQ8eSSIKU4/68f0e94dfc273c41abe67fedcec9abf0/sharesight_money-weighted-return.png?w=950)\n\nFor
  the vast majority of investors a money-weighted rate of return is the most appropriate
  method of measuring the performance of your portfolio as __you__, the investor,
  control inflows and outflows of the investment portfolio.\n\n## Time vs Money-weighted
  - an example\n\nTo help explain the difference between time-weighted and money-weighted
  returns, let’s imagine an investor who made three trades in a particular stock over
  a period of two years. Let’s assume that:\n\n1. On December 1st 2015, the investor
  invested $1,000 to buy 1,000 units of StockABC at $1.00 per share\n2. On December
  1st 2016, they bought another 1,000 units of StockABC at a price of $2.00 per share
  (spending $2,000)\n3. On December 1st 2017 the investor sold their entire holding
  of 2,000 StockABC shares after the price fell to $1.25\n\nIn this scenario the investor
  __lost $500__ in this portfolio over the two years.\n\n### Here’s how the return
  numbers for each of these performance methodologies differ in this instance:\n\n-
  __Money-weighted return:__ -12.77% p.a.\n- __Time-weighted (CAGR) return:__ 11.80%
  p.a.\n\nDespite the investor __losing__ money on the portfolio, the __time-weighted
  return was positive__. This is because the time-weighted return is only measuring
  the underlying performance of the shares held in the portfolio and __not__ the actions
  of the investor __buying into or out of__ those shares (inflows and outflows) or
  the impact of __the size__ of those actions over the period being measured.\n\n##
  Why Sharesight uses a money-weighted rate of return methodology\n\nAt Sharesight
  we think the time-weighted rate of return methodology is both less useful and potentially
  misleading for individual investors, who __do__ control when cash flows in and out
  of their portfolios. __We believe a money-weighted performance methodology will
  help you best analyse the true performance of your investment portfolio__ and how
  your choices -- the inflows (buys) and outflows (sells) from your portfolio -- have
  contributed to the returns you have achieved as an investor.\n\n## Notes:\n\n###
  What are considered inflows and outflows from a portfolio?\n\n__Outflows__\n\n1.
  The price paid for any investment\n2. Reinvested dividends or interest (price paid
  for any DRP/DRIP purchases)\n3. Withdrawals (cash removed from the portfolio by
  the investor)\n\n__Inflows__\n\n1. The proceeds from any investment sold (cash that
  remains in the portfolio from any shares sold)\n2. Dividends or interest received
  (cash earned from investments)\n3. Contributions (cash injected into the portfolio
  by an investor)\n\n__Note also:__ If there are __no cash flows__ in or out of the
  portfolio during the period being measured, both money-weighted and time-weighted
  __rates of return will be the same__. \n\n## Start tracking your returns with Sharesight\nJoin
