:title: Enhanced investment search tool
:content: |-
  Our engineers are constantly tweaking and improving [Sharesight](/), ensuring it’s the best portfolio management and reporting system for DIY investors and finance professionals.

  A recent example is our new and improved investment search tool, which makes it easier than ever to manually add holdings to your portfolio(s) – a great solution if you’re just getting started, don’t have many holdings to track, or need to add a new holding you’ve recently acquired.

  These days so many companies, funds, and ETFs are cross-listed on markets around the world. We built this feature to help you pinpoint your precise investment.

  ## How the enhanced investment search tool works
  You may now search on any listed company (or fund) name, or ticker code without first specifying its market or country. The tool will show you a complete list of results, which can also be viewed by market:

  To get a better idea of what we mean, take a look at our recently updated video, [*Adding a holding manually using a buy transaction*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb_tqEY8X2E):
