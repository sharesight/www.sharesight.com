  alt=\"Tracking crypto custom investments\">\n\n<small> When entering a cryptocurrency
  custom investment into Sharesight, make sure to select the country of the fiat currency
  used to purchase your cryptocurrency. </small>\n\nOnce you have created a Custom
  Investment, you will be redirected to the Manual Holding screen to add details such
  as the trade date, trade type, quantity and price. To track the performance of your
  crypto investment in your portfolio, simply update the price movements by uploading
  a spreadsheet of prices or manually entering the price movements on a regular basis.
  \n\nIf you are tracking custom crypto investments along with the rest of the stocks
  in your portfolio, it is also advised that you classify your investments using the
  <a href=“https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/”>Custom
  Groups</a> feature to easily differentiate between these different asset classes.</p>\n</details>"
