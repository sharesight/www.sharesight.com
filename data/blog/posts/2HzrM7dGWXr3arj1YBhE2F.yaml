:title: Sharesight passes 150,000 users worldwide
:content: |-
  We are excited to announce the Sharesight user base has grown to 150,000 global users! This is a huge achievement for Sharesight, considering it was just one year ago that we hit [100,000 users](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-hits-100000-users/).

  Sharesight has [come a long way since it was founded 13 years ago](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesights-10-year-fintech-journey/) – from our first paying customer in 2008 to our global launch in 2015, and now 150,000 users in more than 100 countries.

  It all comes down to one simple goal: to make tracking the true performance of investments easier.

  To get an understanding of how far Sharesight has come, co-founders Tony and Scott Ryburn were originally frustrated DIY investors trying to grapple with a spreadsheet that was getting more and more complicated.

  "That’s when we decided to develop Sharesight, and seeing so much growth in our user base really shows that we are achieving what we set out to do, which is to solve the problem of accurately tracking your investment performance," says Scott, who is also Sharesight’s CTO.

  Now that we’ve reached 150,000 users, let’s take a closer look at some of the numbers behind Sharesight.

  ## Sharesight in numbers

  ### A new trade is added to Sharesight *every 23 seconds*

  Whether it be via [Sharesight’s API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api), [imported with a spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/?_ga=2.2261496.974166595.1595807692-1579815040.1595575078#1), a [trade confirmation email](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/?_ga=2.30040567.974166595.1595807692-1579815040.1595575078), or [manually added](https://help.sharesight.com/setting-up-your-holdings/), Sharesight users on average add a new trade **_every 23 seconds_****.**

  ### Sharesight users are tracking *almost 2 million holdings*

  Sharesight is currently tracking almost 2 million individual holdings (**_1,866,710 to be precise_**), with the average [Sharesight Investor plan](https://www.sharesight.com/pricing/) user tracking 61 different investment holdings and Expert plan users tracking an average of 130.

  On an individual portfolio level, users have recorded 92 trades on average.

  ### Investors in *over 100 countries* track their investments with Sharesight

  While the majority of Sharesight’s 150,000 users are in Australia and New Zealand, investors from over 100 countries around the globe currently use Sharesight to track their investments.

  As we grow globally, we will continue to add new features and support more brokers. Currently, we support [179 global brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/?_ga=2.2403960.974166595.1595807692-1579815040.1595575078) and [82 currencies](https://oxr.readme.io/docs/supported-currencies), with more always being added to our list.

  ## Looking to the future
