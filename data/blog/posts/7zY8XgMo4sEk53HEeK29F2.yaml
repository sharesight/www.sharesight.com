:content: "The much awaited and anticipated Banking Royal Commission report was released
  on 4 February 2019 around 4:45 PM. If you have read the recommendations in the report,
  chances are your response fall in one of two categories, either: \"that’s the way
  to go\" or “is that it?”, with seemingly more people in the latter camp!\n![ASX

  have a reasonable sample of retail investors tracking their investments with [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/).
  So let’s gauge what their reaction to the Banking Royal Commission report was by
  looking at the trades made in finance stocks, both before and after the report’s
  release.\n\n## ASX financial sector trades and Banking Royal Commission\n\nBefore
  the announcement, we see that the buying activity outpaces the sell activity (which
  is typical for Sharesight users on average), but on 5 February after the report
  was released, selling activity outpaces buy trades by our user base.\n\n![ASX financial
  sector trades and Banking Royal Commission](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7FvyKZZwqROSzASMQRTTRj/77d9b5f20ea3f5a1abf6dd297f1b0d40/ASX_financial_sector_trades_and_Banking_Royal_Commission.png?w=950)\n\n##
  ASX financial sector trades before the Banking Royal Commission report\n\nOn the
  day leading up to the Banking Royal Commission’s report disclosure, Commonwealth
  Bank, Westpac and ANZ had more buy trades, but AMP and NAB had more sell trades
  and these made up the 5 most-traded financial stocks by the Sharesight user base.\n\n![ASX

  ASX financial sector trades after the Banking Royal Commission report\n\nStock prices
  by end of day on 5 February went up for [all of the big four banks](https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/banking-royal-commission-hayne-prompts-19b-rally-for-the-banks-20190205-h1avud):
  with ANZ 6.5%, CBA 4.69%, WBC 7.36%, NAB 3.91% and for AMP by 9.95%. Once again,
  these stocks made the top 5 most-traded financial stocks for the Sharesight user
  base on that day, but with more sell trades seen than usual, with investors possibly
  locking-in these strong gains based on the report’s findings.\n\n![ASX financial
