:title: Import Saxo Capital Market trade details into Sharesight
:url_slug: sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-saxo-markets
:content: "###### 10-Sep-2019: Our new API integration with Saxo Markets allows you
  to automatically sync your Saxo trades to Sharesight. For more info, see: *[Sync
  trades to Sharesight from Saxo Markets](/blog/sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-saxo-markets/)*.\n\nDid
  you know that you can import trades into your Sharesight portfolio from over [100
  brokers around the world?](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-sharesight-from-100-brokers/)
  In 2012 we developed a solution that allows you to record your buy and sell trades
  via the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  (PDF contract notes) sent to you when trading with some brokers. \n\nWe’ve now added
  the ability to import trades to your Sharesight portfolio from Saxo Capital Markets
  Australia (owned by Danish based Saxo Bank). This makes it easier than ever for
  investors to leverage our award-winning performance, dividend tracking, and tax
  reporting features.\n\n## Who is Saxo Capital Markets?\n\nFrom the [Saxo Capital
  Markets about us page](https://www.home.saxo/en-au/about-us):\n\n*“Saxo Capital
  Markets (Australia) Pty Ltd is a subsidiary of Saxo Bank A/S, an online trading
  and investment specialist. Saxo Capital Markets (Australia) Pty Ltd is licensed
  and regulated by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission and has operated
  in Sydney since 2011.”*\n\n## How to enable Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails
  feature\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n__Note:__ Unfortunately Saxo Capital Markets does not
  automatically email trade confirmations, so you will need to manually download the
  trade details report PDFs and attach them to an email you send to your Sharesight
  broker import email address with ‘Saxo’ in the title. For more details on how to
  do this, see our help page on [manually forwarding Trade Confirmation Emails to
  Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/manually-forwarding-broker-contract-notes-to-sharesight/).\n\n##
  We need your help to add more brokers!\n\nWe can only guarantee this will work for
  Saxo Capital Markets contract notes in Australia. If you trade with Saxo in a region
  outside Australia, please get in touch by chatting to our support team so we can
  add support for trade confirmations in your region.\n\nIf you trade with any other
  broker not yet on [Sharesight’s list of supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/),
  but they email you trade confirmations/contract notes (or you’re able to download
  the PDF trade confirmations from your broker), ask us to support your broker by
  sharing an ‘idea’ on our [community forum](https://community.sharesight.com/), or
  by leaving us a message in the chat interface located at the bottom-right of Sharesight.\n\nWe
  just need a handful of Trade Confirmation Emails in order to support a new broker,
  so reach out today if you’d like to see yours added!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- [5
