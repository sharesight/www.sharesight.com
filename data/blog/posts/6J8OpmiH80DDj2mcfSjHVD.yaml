:content: "*This article tells the story of actual Sharesight users, but names have
  been changed to protect their privacy. The Contribution Analysis Report described
  is available on the Sharesight [Investor and Expert plans](https://www.sharesight.com/pricing/).*\n\nIn
  this blog, we explore how Sharesight users Nick and Katie use the [Contribution
  Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  to get a deeper understanding of their portfolio’s performance. To learn more about
  the report’s features and how one couple uses this report to evaluate the success
  of their stock selection and asset allocation, keep reading. \n\n![Contribution
  Analysis Report Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6Lq1JSfJ1J6QXI7QMNQe0z/267567d6792198fd6838a6b534388d4b/Contribution_Analysis_Report_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is the Contribution Analysis Report?\n\nBased on [attribution analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/attribution-analysis.asp)
  principles, Sharesight’s [Contribution Analysis Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/contribution-analysis-report/)
  breaks down the total return of your portfolio by the components that are driving
  your returns, such as stock selection, asset allocation or exposure to certain countries,
  sectors, or industries. This is important for investors because it helps explain
  how your returns are derived and where your portfolio tracks or diverges from the
  benchmark. Therefore, to get the most out of the Contribution Analysis Report, Sharesight
  users are encouraged to [add a benchmark to their portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)
  and determine their asset allocation through the [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculate-investment-portfolio-diversification-sharesight/)
  prior to running the report. \n\n### Key features \nThe Contribution Analysis Report
  runs an analysis on all of the current holdings in your portfolio (with the option
  to also include sold positions), breaking down each holding’s total return by capital
  gains, dividends and currency gains. Customisable to your needs, it allows you to
  run the analysis over any date range, plus organise the results by market, currency,
  sector, industry, investment type, country, Sharesight portfolio or a [custom grouping](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  of your choice. The ability to download the Contribution Analysis Report into an
  Excel spreadsheet, PDF or Google Sheet also makes it easy to share this report with
  a financial adviser to discuss your investment strategy. \n\n## Evaluate portfolio
  performance based on asset allocation\n\nWhile you can run the Contribution Analysis
  Report using any of the Sharesight groupings (sector/industry/country), investors
  like Nick and Katie use Sharesight’s [Custom Group](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  feature to view their performance across their asset allocation strategy.\n\nWith
  a target asset allocation in mind for both their personal investments and SMSFs
  (weighted towards equities) they both set up [Custom Groups within Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/).
  After they set up their Custom Groups, they allocated each of their holdings into
  one of the categories:\n\n* Equities\n\n* Unlisted funds\n\n* Real estate\n\n* Alternatives\n\n*
  Cash and Other\n\nThey use these buckets to keep track of their asset allocation
  strategy.\n\n![Custom Groups 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/37wQbxyORKjt3DImV3SxtG/a5afa8476186399c9773ed514883c744/Custom_Groups_1_.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Get deep portfolio insights with the Contribution Analysis Report\n\nWith the Contribution
  Analysis Report, they are able to dive deeper into the performance of each of their
  holdings by various groupings to stay on top of their portfolio.\n\n### Which asset
  class contributed to overall return?\n\nAt a high level, looking at the performance
  of their asset classes for the calendar year, it’s clear that Equities have performed
  the best in terms of income plus capital growth.\n\n![Asset classes Contribution

  Nick and Katie’s SMSF personal portfolio contribution analysis report graph </small>\n\nLooking
  at the chart above, Equities contributed the most in terms of overall return during
  the calendar year, followed by Alternatives, Real estate and finally Cash and cash
  equivalents. Diving a bit deeper into the Equities part of their portfolio, they
  can look at which holdings in each of their Custom Groups contributed to their overall
  return – evaluated through the prism of capital gains, dividend and currency gains.\n\n![Sharesight

  How much did each holding contribute to overall return?\n\nTo calculate the contribution
  of each holding, Nick and Katie select the \"do not group\" option in the report
  setting, to evaluate how each holding in their portfolio contributed to overall
  performance. In the screenshot below, you will see the contribution of each holding
  in their portfolio, sorted in descending order.\n\n![Sharesight holdings ungrouped

  are multiple ways in which to look at the Contribution Analysis Report. For example,
  one other way Nick looks at his overall performance is by running the report on
  a [Consolidated View](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/), which allows
  him to look across multiple portfolios in a single view. \n\n**Note:** All portfolios
  must be of the same tax residency to create a Consolidated View.\n\n![Sharesight

  Nick and Katie have divided their investments into three different portfolios based
  on their tax requirements. </small>\n\nSome other notes while looking at the contribution
  analysis report:\n\n* The sum of the absolute values of the contribution percentages
  should equal 100%. For example, you need to ignore the negative signs and add the
  percentage numbers to arrive at 100%.\n\n* You can sort the order in which the holdings
  are presented by clicking on the header row – by holding name, capital gains, dividends,
  currency, total return or contribution.\n\n* You can also change the period of reporting
  by using any of the options in the date picker in the report.\n\n* The Contribution
  Analysis Report can be run on a Consolidated View as well. You can use the \"group
  by portfolio\" option to look at how each of your portfolios contributed to your
  overall return.\n\n## Want to know more about the Contribution Analysis Report?\n\nFor
