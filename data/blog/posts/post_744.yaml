  One of the adverse consequences arising from the closure of the Investorweb website following its sale to Commsec has been the loss of its share portfolio manager.

  An Investorweb customer drew this to our attention recently after discovering and logging onto [Sharesight](/). He wrote to us saying:

  > I was really surprised at the difficulty in finding a replacement, which was is why I was so pleased when I found you site.

  If you are an Investorweb client who is looking for a top-quality portfolio management service we suggest you [sign-up for a free Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup). We are sure you will be impressed.

  Sharesight focuses exclusively on providing a straightforward, affordable and independent online share portfolio manager for DIY investors.
