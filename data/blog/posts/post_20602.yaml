:title: Sharesight + Xero for financial advisers
:url_slug: sharesight-xero-financial-advisers
:content: "Financial advisers are the fastest growing [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) client
  channel. This took us by surprise, but after chatting with recent converts we've
  discovered the reasons why.\n\nAdvisers are looking for solutions to aggregate client
  holdings. They want a browser-based, cloud-based, experience just like the apps
  they use everyday (news, social, travel, etc.). They need to track assets from platforms,
  wraps, and brokerage accounts in one place. If a client is moving off-platform,
  they need a way to seamlessly track holdings not bundled to execution or research.
  They don't want portfolios to disappear into an offline black hole or impossible
  to use old-school software. And it needs to be accessible both for them and their
  clients.\n\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/88323587\" class=\"embedly-card\"
  data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://player.vimeo.com/video/88323587</a>\n\nSharesight
  solves all of these problems. Don't believe us? [Try it for free](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup).
  But we don't stop there. We're building connections to an entire ecosystem of other
  applications. In the past, investment product providers and their in-house IT obsessed
  over losing clients, so they rushed out lots of portfolio admin technology, which
  was never their core competency. Their focus was on getting client assets under
  management. As such, Sharesight isn't an execution platform, or a research platform.
  And it's not an accounting platform. We stick to what we do best: portfolio tracking
  and reporting. \n\nEnter [Xero](/xero/). They're making inroads into dealer groups
  from two directions: they're helping financial planning firms [run their businesses
  efficiently](https://www.xero.com/accounting-software/), and they're helping advisers
  create budgets for their clients. Xero does bank reconciliation beautifully, and
  with [Xero Cashbook](/xero/), advisers are empowering their clients to take control
  of their finances. Getting a handle on your household P/L or your latte expenditure
  has never been more fun (actually it was never fun, but it is now!)\n\n![Sharesight

  the budgeting is organised, that's where Sharesight comes for investment tracking.
  Once an adviser has setup their client portfolios, [we send all investment gains,
  losses, buys, sells, and dividends to Xero automatically in real-time.](/blog/sharesights-beautiful-xero-integration/)
  And since we sync with [over 40 brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/),
  all client trades flow from execution to Sharesight to Xero in less than 60 seconds.
  Clients are now able to see their household budget from council rates to corporate
  actions- all in one place.\n\nAnd for cash accounts, we're building a seamless link
  to pull back the closing balances from the bank accounts maintained in Xero. This
  way we'll let Xero do what they do best, and we'll roll up the cash positions into
  the overall portfolio calculations.\n\n![Xero + Sharesight - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/689RR3eSjumaM6uUgCQuiu/8395bf9c574e6ee8410daddf6d7c510f/xero_sharesight.png?w=950)\n<sub>_Example
  of a dividend sent to Xero. Itemized. Automatically._</sub>\n\nThe Sharesight +
  Xero connection for financial advisers is a huge step forwards, but we realize more
  can be done. We're working with other apps to bring them into the ecosystem: risk
  profiling, SOA generation, insurance, property, the lists goes on. **One thing is
  for certain, a collection of best-of-breed apps is much better than one piece of
  technology trying to do too much.**\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Blog -- [Beat the
