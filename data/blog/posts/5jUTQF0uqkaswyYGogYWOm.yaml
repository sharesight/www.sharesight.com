:title: 5 ways to maximise returns in a low-return world
:content: "Today, equities markets are in the very last stages of a prolonged bull
  cycle — the phase that saw great optimism and investor confidence is now predicted
  to come to a close, thanks to both the [trade war tensions between the United States
  and China](https://www.afr.com/news/economy/trade/uschina-trade-war-a-loselose-scenario-analysts-say-20190108-h19u27),
  and the impact of central banks (particularly US fed) [tightening monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tightmonetarypolicy.asp).
  Both factors combined, these market conditions create an environment where lower
  returns are likely for investors in the short-medium term. \n\nWhile lower returns
  are never great news, the changing market does present an opportune time to review
  your portfolio and your approach to look at strategies to minimise costs and maximise
  returns. In peak periods it is easy to ride the wave and put off assessing how we
  can reduce costs. \n\nIn order to maximise returns going forward, investors need
  to be smart about minimising investment costs. Let's explore how you can reduce
  costs, and maximise returns in 2019:\n\n![ways to maximise investment returns](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1p7Awoq2wsEIi8acYS8cwy/c9c9d88acc8a0a256f3141bd3373607c/ways_to_maximise_investment_returns.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Take ownership of your investment decisions\n\nThe less engaged you are with your
  investments, the more you will need to rely on others to manage them. The costs
  involved in having someone else manage your investments can eat into any returns,
  and in a low return world, that can be significant. \n\nTake some time to review
  your providers and make sure that you don't pay ongoing fees for advice that was
  really a one-off. Look for arrangements where you pay for the time incurred (when
  suppliers are doing real work for your portfolio) rather than a percentage of the
  portfolio for evermore. \n\n## Control your portfolio admin\n\nBeing organised with
  your data is another way to minimise fees; creating less work for your accountant
  and keeping extra cash in your pocket. Investment platforms or wraps will typically
  bundle in some sort of portfolio admin tools with their service, but you are paying
  for them in their high fees. To move away from these, you’ll want to take matters
  into your own hands.\n\nRelying on your [brokers’ performance figures](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  is not ideal as they typically only report on the difference between what you paid
  for it and what it’s worth today. They do not take the time frame into account.
  A 20% return over 5 years is really only a 4% annual return. They also do not factor
  brokerage fees, dividends, or currency fluctuations into your return figures.\n\nWhile
  you could create a [complicated spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  that handles all this, a better solution is to use a dedicated portfolio tracker
  such as Sharesight. It makes it easy to manage all your investments in one place,
  automatically calculates your total annualised return and gives you a running report
  of your dividend income; so you’re always aware of how you’re going.\n\n## Watch
  management fees\n\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs) seek to emulate the returns of an
  index rather than trying to beat it, whereas as actively managed funds seek to do
  the latter, but don’t always succeed. The fees for actively managed funds are higher
  than passive funds, in the region of 2%+ vs 0.07-1% typically with ETFs. When equities
  are only returning low single digits this management cost is a significant part
  of your return lost. \n\nChoosing a passive ETF can help you to bring your management
  fee down without making your returns suffer. In fact, most active managers fail
  to beat the index over longer time frames. \n\nYou can test the theory in your own
  portfolio within Sharesight. You can [compare any holding against a common benchmark](/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/).
  Additionally, you can group your actively managed funds separately from your ETFs
  and share picks to compare and contrast which are performing better after management
  fees and other expenses.\n\n## Don’t pay more tax than you need to\n\nYou should
  be proactive and leverage tax loss selling where appropriate (and within ATO rules).
  Sharesight can help by calculating any unrealised capital gains in your portfolio
  to help you model how the resulting taxable income would impact your capital gains
  if particular shares were sold on the reporting date. This can help offset any capital
  gains you have incurred during the financial year. While many investors explore
  and leverage [tax loss selling](/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  toward the end of the year, it is possible to harvest tax losses at any time.\n\nThe
  timing of your capital gains and losses is important for tax reasons. To avoid paying
  more tax than you need to, you should explore the impact of different allocation
  methods. [Sharesight's Capital Gains Tax report](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-2017-2018-capital-gains-tax/)
  lets investors model the impact of first-in first-out (FIFO), last-in first-out
  (LIFO) and other sale allocation methods on your capital gains; taking care of the
  math and allowing you to optimise your tax position by choosing different sale allocation
  methods.\n\n## Save on accounting\n\nManaging your portfolio tax admin doesn't have
  to be as hard as it once was. Sharesight was built according to ATO rules and includes
  capital gains tax and [taxable income reports](/blog/improved-taxable-income-report-for-australian-investors/)
  that make it easy to sort out your tax obligations. \n\nToday, you can easily prepare
  your own tax reports and self-file your tax return to the ATO without an accountant.
  Even if you choose to file the return with an accountant, having everything in order
  and up to date in Sharesight allows you to minimise the time and cost that would
  have otherwise been taken by your accountant when preparing your tax returns. And
  portfolio sharing capabilities let you securely share portfolio access directly
  with your accountant and/or financial advisor, so they have everything they need
  — not just at tax time, but throughout the year (so you can minimise surprises next
  tax season).\n\nTaking ownership of your investment decisions, watching out for
  unnecessary management fees, managing your own portfolio admin and implementing
  strategies to ensure you aren't paying more tax than necessary, are relatively simple
  ways to gain back significant revenues that you may not have realised you were losing
  throughout this bull cycle. \n\nPlatforms like Sharesight help you to take stock
  of your portfolio, manage more yourself and gain a better view of which providers
  you need and which you can live without. Don't wait until the lower returns really
  kick in to assess your investment portfolio and how you can reduce your costs and
  maximise your returns for 2019.\n\n[Sign up for a free Sharesight account today](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
