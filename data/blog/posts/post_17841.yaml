:title: What’s in a logo?
:url_slug: whats-in-a-logo
:content: "Accountants and financial advisers probably noticed the extensive face-lift
  we’ve given to [Sharesight Pro](/pro/). We plan on doing the same design improvements
  on the Retail side of the house too. We wanted to build a clean new look, while
  still explaining all the time and money we save our professional users. New visitors
  will find a lot more information about what we do and the problems we solve.\n\n![Sharesight

  \n\nAlong with the site refresh, we released a new Sharesight Pro logo. We think
  the clean lines, black, white, and grey colour scheme convey a professional, clean,
  and crisp feel. \n\n![featured - Sharesight Pro](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/35LpJZ88n6K5AxqTObAZF1/44ae4c3285316709b553246a9fa709b4/featured_sharesight-pro.png?w=950)\n\nChoosing
  a logo is not easy. Trust me. We’re a small, yet highly opinionated group at Sharesight.
  Our employees hail from New Zealand, Australia, the US, Italy, Germany, and the
  UK so you can bet we get input from all perspectives. But we all agree on the importance
  of good design. Dealing with investment accounting can be complex, and we want to
  make using Sharesight and conveying this information to your clients easy.\n\n![Sharesight

  \n\nCorporate logos tend to be self-fulfilling. In other words, our assessment of
  the company and its product shapes our opinion of their logo in retrospect. But
  you have to admire the amount of resources and foresight that do go into shaping
  the images of some of the world’s biggest brands. \n\nTake FedEx, for example. Ever
  notice the directional arrow hidden in the text? How about Amazon? Yes, the smile
  is obvious, but did you pick up how it indicates they sell everything from A to
  Z? The casualness of their logo also translates well to the casual, usability of
  their site. Ever wonder why the Apple logo is so appealing? Sure, the Isaac Newton
  reference is cute, but some say it uses the famous Fibonacci sequence in the angles
  of the bite out of the apple, the stem, and the dimple at the bottom. Even Google,
  with their goofy colours, playful name, and clean search engine serves as a clever
  juxtaposition to their enormous advertising business.\n\nNow, we’ve got a long way
  to go before being recognised on the level of the above brands, but we are putting
  a lot of time and effort into our design process. I’d expect more changes in the
  future as well as we grow and crystallise our corporate identity. We certainly hope
  you benefit as a result.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- [Beat the tax time rush --
