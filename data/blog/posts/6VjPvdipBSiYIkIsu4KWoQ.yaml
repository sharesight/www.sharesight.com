:title: Easily import Hatch trades to Sharesight
:url_slug: easily-import-hatch-trades-to-sharesight
:content: "###### Note: There is an updated version of this blog. Click [here](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/investors-can-now-sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-hatch/)
  to be redirected to the most recent version. \n\nThe Sharesight team loves to connect
  with fellow fintech startups -- so we were glad when the team at Kiwi Wealth recently
  told us about *Hatch*, their new digital financial platform that gives NZ investors
  easy access to US share markets.\n\nWe’re excited by [Hatch](https://www.hatchinvest.nz/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Sharesight+Hatch&utm_source=Sharesight),
  and the opportunities it opens up to increase portfolio diversification for NZ investors.
  So we’ve worked with Hatch to make it easy for investors to import trade details
  from Hatch into Sharesight -- simply by using our Trade Confirmation Emails import
  feature. \n\nThis makes it easier than ever for NZ investors to leverage our award-winning
  performance, dividend tracking, and tax reporting features.\n\n![import-hatch-invest-trades-to-sharesight

  Who is Hatch?\nFrom the [Hatch site](https://www.hatchinvest.nz/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Sharesight+Hatch&utm_source=Sharesight):\n\n*“Hatch
  is Kiwi Wealth’s digital financial platform, we work with DriveWealth and World
  First to put the world at your fingertips.”*\n\n*“You can finally invest in the
  brands you know so well. Own a piece of the world’s largest companies and benefit
  from their success. ETFs more your thing? Access the world by investing in over
  450 index, industry and style-based options, all listed on the US share markets.*\n\n*Invest
  dollar amounts to buy as much or as little of a company or ETF as you like, even
  if it’s a fraction of a share. Fractional investing is a great way to diversify
  your portfolio and gives you access to shares that used to be unaffordable. Thought
  Amazon shares were out of your league? Think again. ”*\n\n## How to enable Sharesight’s
  Trade Confirmation Emails feature\n\nIt’s easy to enable Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation
  Emails import feature to begin adding your trades to your Sharesight portfolio.
  Simply read our [Trade Confirmation Email import help page](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  to get started.\n\n__Note:__ Unfortunately Hatch does not at thie time allow you
  to specify your Sharesight portfolio Trade Confirmation Emails address to automatically
  forward trade confirmations to your portfolio. You will need to manually forward
  the two trade confirmation emails Hatch send you (one for whole share quantities,
  plus a second email containing the details if there any fractional shares as part
  of the trade) to your Sharesight Trade Confirmation Emails address.\n\n__Also note:__
  The trade confirmation emails from Hatch do not include transaction dates (yet,
  this is coming soon), so Sharesight relies on the send date in the email header
  for this information. This means you will need to forward Sharesight Hatch trade
  confirmation emails the date you make the trade, or you will need to manually edit
  the date in Sharesight.\n\nFor more details on how to do this, see our help page
  on manually forwarding Trade Confirmation Emails to Sharesight.\n\n## We need your
  help to add more brokers!\n\nWe’re constantly looking to add support for more brokers
  like Hatch to Sharesight. \n\nIf you trade with any other broker not yet on [Sharesight’s
  list of supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/), but
  they email you trade confirmations/contract notes (or you’re able to download the
  PDF trade confirmations from your broker), ask us to support your broker by sharing
  an ‘idea’ on our [community forum](https://community.sharesight.com/), or by leaving
  us a message in the chat interface located at the bottom-right of Sharesight.\n\nWe
  just need a handful of Trade Confirmation Emails/PDFs if they are manually downloaded
  in order to support a new broker, so reach out today if you’d like to see yours
  added!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- [5 ways Sharesight helps NZ investors at tax time](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-nz-investors-at-tax-time/)\n-
