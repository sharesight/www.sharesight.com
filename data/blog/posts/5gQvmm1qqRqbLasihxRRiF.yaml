:content: "Investors trading with Australian broker [Westpac](https://www.westpac.com.au/)
  can automatically import historical and ongoing trades to their Sharesight portfolio,
  giving them access to Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\nWestpac is one of [more than 170 global brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  supported by Sharesight. The portfolio tracker provides investors with automatically
  updated price and dividend information on [over 170,000 stocks, ETFs and mutual/managed
  funds](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),
  making it easier than ever to track the performance of your investments. \n\n![image

  Who is Westpac?\n\nEstablished in 1817 and originally known as the Bank of New South
  Wales, [Westpac](https://www.westpac.com.au/) is the oldest banking institution
  in Australia. The bank has an [online share trading platform](https://www.westpac.com.au/personal-banking/share-trading/)
  which gives Australian investors access to a range of Australian and international
  equities, ETFs and options, with brokerage fees starting from $19.95. The platform
  enables investors to trade in a range of global markets including the New York Stock
  Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Hong Kong Stock Exchange
  (HKG), which [Sharesight also supports](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  Other features of Westpac’s share trading platform include the option to invest
  in managed portfolios, as well as access to research, custom charting tools and
  trading alerts.\n\n## Why you should import your Westpac trades to Sharesight\n\nBy
  importing your trades with Westpac to Sharesight, you can easily [track your investment
  performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  across multiple brokers and asset classes, or take advantage of Sharesight’s advanced
  performance and tax reporting designed for the needs of Australian investors. \n\nUnlike
  the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight gives investors the true picture of
  their investment performance by taking into account the impact of brokerage fees,
  [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and [capital gains](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  on their returns. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports for investors
  including [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/), [Portfolio
  Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/), [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  and [Future Income](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/) (upcoming dividends).
  The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/),
  [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio. \n\n## How to import your Westpac trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight’s
  [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n## Add historical trades through your Westpac account\n\nThe
  easiest way to build your Sharesight portfolio is to [directly import trades from
  your Westpac account to Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/westpac/). This
  populates your Sharesight portfolio with historical buy and sell trades straight
  from your trading account. \n\n![image 1 Westpac](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5MXsOHqkI3dfAsuojResou/8a295cd5e63b495473132227a187d00c/image_1_Westpac.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  do this, you will need to enter your Westpac login details and choose the trading
  details you wish to import into Sharesight. Once you have imported your historical
  trades into Sharesight, you can then automatically keep your portfolio up to date
  by importing ongoing trades using the Trade Confirmation Emails feature, as mentioned
  below. \n\n**Note: Your Westpac login details will not be saved by Sharesight and
  your trading data is downloaded through a secure connection. Sharesight has no official
  relationship with Westpac and offers this service purely for your convenience. If
  you do not wish to disclose your Westpac login details we recommend importing via
  spreadsheet file or Trade Confirmation Emails as outlined below.**\n\n## How to
  import historical trades through a spreadsheet\n\nIf you prefer not to use your
  broker account login details to connect to Sharesight, another way to easily import
  historical trades to Sharesight is by uploading a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  of trades from your trading account. \n\n![image 2 Westpac](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4nC11YzJU3UG6pDe8jHTUX/80e947b8b9e2bd955cd957e99aa08d1d/image_2_Westpac.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio. \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nIt’s easy to use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  to automatically add future Westpac trades to your Sharesight portfolio. Read our
  [Trade Confirmation Emails help page](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  to get started, then forward your trade confirmations to your unique portfolio email
  address located under the Integrations tab in the Trade Confirmation Emails section.\n\n![image
