:title: Greetings from the Melbourne Xero Roadshow
:url_slug: greetings-from-melbourne
:content: "Ah, Melbourne. So sophisticated, so indifferent to Sydney’s brashness,
  so rainy. We have a special place in our hearts for Melbourne at Sharesight. If
  Wellington had a sister city, it would be Melbourne. The city feels extra-conducive
  to cloud-based companies (I avoided the all too obvious cloud/rain pun). We have
  a lot of friends building some really cool stuff in Melbourne. Not to mention the
  city’s grid system makes our General Manager a bit homesick for Chicago.\n\n![Melbourne
  Xero Roadshow](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3LXbJh8wQgE8c0wemWCUqo/31c2a354a4ef91da8e40f7c9325350af/Melbourne-Image.png?w=950)\n\nThis
  was our second stop along the Xero Roadshow, and we couldn’t believe the turnout.
  Nearly 600 accountants, bookkeepers, and financial advisers joined us at the Crown
  in Southbank. At one point our stand was 3 people deep trying to get a peek at our
  demo. From the looks of it, our mates at [PocketRent](http://pocketrent.com), [Spotlight](https://www.spotlightreporting.com),
  and [Fathom](https://www.fathomhq.com) were equally busy.\n\nThis convinces us more
  and more that the financial services industry - particularly financial advice is
  gearing up for a huge change. These days being locked into a walled garden just
  doesn’t cut it. Everyone and their mother has a smartphone with an app store. Why
  can’t everyday financial services be this way? Thankfully, entrepreneurial practices
  who want to make use of the best apps on the market are leading the charge. Transparency
  and communication are the name of the game and we’re proud to be a part of this
  disruption.\n\nI sat through a couple of the Xero demos and learned that Xero Cash
  Book is the perfect solution for financial advisers to help their clients manage
  their everyday budgets. After all, that’s a sadly overlooked, but critical component
  to what a financial adviser should be doing! Once you start reconciling those bank
  transactions, you may never look back.\n\nAnd when it comes to investing, it’s nearly
  impossible for a young, hungry adviser to justify putting client assets onto an
  expensive wrap product. Keep in mind, financial professionals are just a_ simple
  Google search away_ from having to make an awkward justification.\n\nThat’s where
  [Sharesight](/) comes in. We are THE alternative to expensive and poorly functioning
  wrap and platform software. They were built to sell investment products. We were
  built to provide cloud-based tracking and reporting - that’s it. Moreover, most
  client funds sit across multiple locations - why not aggregate everything and provide
  constant access and reportability in a cost effective way? \n\nIt seemed to make
  sense to 600 people in Melbourne.\n\nNext stop [Perth](/blog/greetings-from-perth/),
  the wild west.\n\n**Almost forgot to mention - special thanks for the Xero Melbourne
  crew for their hospitality. Cool new digs!**"
