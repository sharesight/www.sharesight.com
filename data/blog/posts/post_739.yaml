:title: When will the share market bounce back and how long will it take?
:url_slug: when-will-the-share-market-bounce-back-and-how-high-will-it-bounce
:content: "For those of us with an interest in the share market this is an issue of
  some importance. We all know that when the markets take a tumble they will rise
  again, but it would be great to get a handle on how long it will be before we see
  an upturn and how strong that upturn will be.\n\nHere’s my take on the situation.
  Caveat: I might change my mind next week!\n\nThere is no doubt that there is going
  to be a major reorganisation of credit globally. The consequences of such a massive
  change that will embroil the Government (and quasi-government organisations) so
  extensively in the financial markets, are impossible to predict. However history
  suggests that anomalies, distortions, loopholes, exploitation and ever increasing
  complexity and cost will rule. \n\nDespite this gloomy prediction, I also think
  that while the process of restructuring the world's financial markets is occurring,
  the productive sector will quickly get back to something approaching normalcy. In
  other words the players will soon stop obsessing over the score and start concentrating
  on the game.\n\nClearly Australia will not escape the impact of the credit crisis
  or the effects of the recession that is likely to hit most of our trading partners.
  In view of this it is slightly surprising to me that PM Kevin Rudd has predicted
  2% annual GDP growth and that this is supported by similar predictions by the big
  4 banks. In fact Westpac is predicting GDP growth of 2.8% over 2008 and 2.2% in
  2009.\n\nWhether these predictions prove to be unduly optimistic remains to be seen
  but there are good reasons to believe we will be less severely affected than most.
  Unlike many countries we have not had major bank collapses, our financial system
  has not been hijacked by out-of-control derivatives trading and the Reserve bank
  has more latitude than most its overseas counterparts to provide further stimulus
  via interest rate cuts if necessary.\n\nAnd there is further reason for optimism
  as well. [According to Westpac CEO Gail Kelly](https://web.archive.org/web/20081208024739/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,24578232-30538,00.html)
  who should know if anyone does, Australian banks, in contrast to their counterparts
  in the US and Britain, have been more conservative in their lending over the past
  decade. She claims that there has been little or no sub-prime lending by the major
  banks, and that average loan-to-value ratios are remarkably low.\n\nSo back to our
  share market. What might all this mean? I believe it will be good news. Our economy
  will be less severely affected than most and this will enhance Australia's reputation
  as a sound place to invest. This in turn will re-stimulate investment in our share
  market from both local, and more importantly, offshore investors.\n\nThis is not
  to say it will not be much tougher than it has been over the past 10 years or so.
  For a start, lack of international demand is likely to depress oil, iron ore and
  coking coal prices. However this is already fully reflected and more in the share
  prices of the likes of Rio Tinto and BHP.\n\nFor those of us interested in the share
  market this is surely the key point. The collapse in our share market prices (the
  S&P/ASX has fallen from 6828 points a year ago to 4018 today) seems out of all proportion
  given an economy with a sound banking system and forecast growth in GDP that most
  countries could not contemplate in their wildest dreams. \n\nSo how long will it
  be before common sense prevails and how strong will the bounce back be? I don’t
  know, but I have certainly persuaded myself not to give up on the Australian share
  market.\n\n**_What are your thoughts?_**\n\n<small>*This information is not a recommendation
