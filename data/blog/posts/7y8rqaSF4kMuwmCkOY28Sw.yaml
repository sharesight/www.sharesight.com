:title: How Affluence Funds Management uses Sharesight
:content: "At [Affluence Funds Management](https://affluencefunds.com.au), we aim
  to achieve superior long-term investment performance. If you invest in an Affluence
  managed fund, you get access to more than 20 of the best fund managers, or ASX Listed
  Investment Companies (LICs) in Australia, as chosen by us. We focus not only on
  delivering the best returns we can but also on making those returns as consistent
  as possible. We take both these goals into account when constructing our fund investment
  portfolios.\n\nWe use [Sharesight](/) to assist us in tracking both the [performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/)
  and tax positions for our managed funds and LICs. We chose Sharesight for several
  reasons, including its cost-effectiveness, the ability to automate trades, its quality
  tax reporting, and the regular data feeds which assist us to accurately value our
  holdings.\n\nThe Sharesight commitment to [continual development](/blog/3-easy-ways-to-automate-your-portfolio-admin/)
  and improvement of their platform is also a key consideration for us, as is our
  shared goal of helping self-directed investors and their advisors get a better investment
  outcome. \n\n![featured affluence-daryl-hires](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1vK7NGNIYM2CqSSsyyegSQ/bef7eca64ff8636f57741822afd3ca99/featured_affluence-daryl-hires.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Automated processing\n\nSharesight saves us a significant amount of processing time.
  We use [Desktop Broker](https://www.desktopbroker.com.au/adviser/) for most of our
  trading in LICs. Those [buy and sell contracts are emailed](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  to Sharesight and automatically processed and uploaded against the transaction.\n
  \nThe [corporate actions feature](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/)
  also means that most LIC dividends and managed fund distributions are created automatically.
  This allows us to check the transaction against the payment advices quickly and
  efficiently.\n\nFinally, the fund data feeds mean that for many of our unlisted
  funds we can see the most up-to-date unit prices. This is dependent on the underlying
  [data from Morningstar](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/morningstar/), but it
  certainly provides a good cross-check against our other sources of information.\n\n![Automated
  Processing](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/KsNXMQb44egE80IMYS8sO/d124a36d22592ee83c9bdfa65a65b599/Automated_Processing.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Tracking performance\n\nWe use the [performance reports](https://help.sharesight.com/reports/)
  regularly, particularly for our listed LICs. Using this data, we can easily check
  performance within a month or even intra-day.\n\nWe reconcile this data monthly
  against our other records to provide a cross-check of our capital gain/loss and
  income calculations.\n\n![Performance Affluence](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/31FYAHBWbeiMwIQse4cu8s/5e442f1b1b8dec41ef7c2e57467ecf1d/Performance_Affluence.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Tax reporting\n\nSharesight has comprehensive [tax reporting](https://help.sharesight.com/reports/)
  that allows us to always have up-to-date information on our LIC and managed fund
  holdings.\n\nBefore we sell a stock or fund, we can quickly ascertain the capital
  gain or loss position and confirm the likely tax impact of selling. This is particularly
  useful where we might be close to the 12-month qualifying period for a discounted
  capital gain on the sale, or where we have recently received a dividend and don’t
  want to breach the 45-day rule, thereby losing entitlement to franking credits.\n\nWe
  also use Sharesight’s tax reporting functions to assist in estimating the tax components
  of our monthly investor distributions. At the end of the tax year, our Sharesight
  data is easily exported and used as part of our annual calculation process with
  our tax advisors.\n\n## Maximising efficiency\n\nFor many investors, finding quality
  managed funds and LICs is a very difficult exercise. There are so many options out
  there, and it’s hard to know which ones might be able to deliver above-average performance.
  It’s tempting to go for the recent outperformers, but quite often that proves to
  be a bad choice.\n\nOur process involves reviewing the thousands of opportunities
  and distilling them down to 25-30 of the best for each of our managed fund portfolios.
  That makes our model fairly unique. Also, we do not charge investors in our funds
  any fixed fee, only a performance fee. We also cap the cost of running our funds
  to limit the impact on investors. All of this means that we must be able to operate
  efficiently. We use a range of tools and service providers to help us in this regard,
  and Sharesight is a key part of our investment infrastructure.\n\n[Sharesight](/)
  has allowed us to manage tax records for our funds and assist with performance reporting
  in a way which is both extremely efficient and cost-effective. Their objective of
  empowering investors to manage their investment portfolios also resonates with us.
  It aligns well with our philosophy of providing self-directed investors and their
  advisors with easy access to many of Australia’s best fund managers.\n \n*To find
