:content: "Welcome to the January 2022 edition of Sharesight’s monthly USA trading
  snapshot, where we look at Sharesight users’ top 20 trades in US stocks on the Nasdaq,
  NYSE and [NYSE American market](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/)
  (AMEX) over the month. \n\nIn this snapshot, buy and sell trades were strongly led
  by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which announced record profit in its latest earnings report.
  Trades were followed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which announced strong earnings
  buoyed by cloud growth; as well as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has reclaimed its
  title as the most-sold smartphone brand in China. Overall, January’s top trades
  were dominated by tech stocks, with many investors responding to the recent (or
  upcoming) release of these companies’ earnings reports. \n\n## Top 20 US stock trades
