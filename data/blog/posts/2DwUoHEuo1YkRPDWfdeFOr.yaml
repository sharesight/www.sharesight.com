  can directly connect their brokerage account to Sharesight, allowing them to automatically
  sync their historic and ongoing trades to their Sharesight portfolio. With support
  for over [200 global brokers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/supported-brokers-global/)

  What is Bendigo Invest Direct?\n\n[Bendigo Invest Direct](https://www.bendigobank.com.au/personal/investing/share-trading/)
  is an online brokerage service owned by Bendigo Bank and provided by [CMC Markets
  Stockbroking](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/connect-from-cmc-markets-stockbroking-directly-to-sharesights-portfolio-tracker/).
  The Australia-based platform allows investors to invest in stocks, ETFs and managed
  funds with access to 15 global markets spanning North America, Europe and the Asia
  Pacific, which are also [supported by Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/).
  Other key features include access to leading stock market research, analytics tools
  and professional charting, as well as the ability to access [unlisted managed funds
  (ASX mFunds)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/managed-funds-live-on-sharesight/).
  \n\n## Why you should import your Bendigo Invest trades to Sharesight\n\nBy importing
  your trades from Bendigo Invest Direct to Sharesight, you can easily see the [complete
  picture of your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  if you trade across multiple brokers and asset classes, plus unlock Sharesight’s
  advanced [tax reporting designed for Australian investors](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-australian-investors-at-tax-time/).\n\nUnlike
  the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight takes into account the impact of brokerage
  fees, dividends and capital gains when calculating investment returns. Sharesight
  also offers a range of powerful reports for investors including Performance, Portfolio
  Diversity, Contribution Analysis, Multi-Period, Multi-Currency Valuation and Future
  Income (upcoming dividends). The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/),
  [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio.\n\n### Track your dividend income\n\nUnlike other portfolio
  trackers, Sharesight automatically [tracks dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  (including [dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/))
  and takes this into account when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make an important contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the value of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more than
  just capital gains in its performance calculations.\n\n![dividend stock Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7hIs4wxypt4ZehKnNMVTHF/20ac605de496f690a81c90718150daa4/dividend_stock_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Calculate your capital gains tax\n\nSharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  is the ultimate CGT calculator for Australian investors. The report automatically
  determines capital gains made on sold shares as per the [ATO rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/),
  eliminating the need for investors to make manual calculations, which can be complex
  and subject to error. Other convenient features include the ability to optimise
  your tax position by choosing your sale allocation methods, as well as a breakdown
  of your portfolio’s short-term and long-term capital gains and losses.\n\n## How
  to import your Bendigo Invest trades to Sharesight\n\nInvestors trading through
  Bendigo Invest Direct can easily [establish a secure connection](https://help.sharesight.com/bendigo/)
  between their Bendigo Invest and Sharesight accounts, which will automatically import
  historical and ongoing trades into their portfolio. Investors who choose not to
  link their Bendigo Invest and Sharesight accounts can also import their historical
  trading data by uploading a [spreadsheet file of trades](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/),
  or have their [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  automatically forwarded to Sharesight to capture ongoing trades. \n\n## Connect
  your Bendigo Invest account directly to Sharesight\n\nBendigo Invest Direct leverages
  the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) to allow investors to
  automatically import historical and ongoing trades into a Sharesight portfolio.\n\nIf
  you’re new to Sharesight, you can get started by [signing up for a free account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup?_ga=2.118866443.344298505.1598830718-1579815040.1595575078).\n\n![Sharesight

  to establish a connection between your Bendigo Invest and Sharesight accounts. \n\n**Note:

  time.**\n\n## Start tracking your Bendigo Invest trades with Sharesight\n\nJoin
