:title: 'ETFs versus LICs: What you need to know'
:content: "Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Listed Investment Companies (LICs) are
  both very popular investment choices among retail investors in Australia. They have
  many similarities, but have some important differences investors should be aware
  of.\n\nSo what are the key differences between ETFs and LICs, and which one is right
  for your portfolio? Let’s take a look at both investment options to find out.\n\n
  ![ETF vs LIC differences](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2P9TbLgxleGU5T6NP681ZH/7e989154bf32cc26d5e53966b192d4e4/ETF_vs_LIC_differences.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is an ETF?\n\nAn ETF is a type of managed fund that trades on a stock exchange
  like regular shares. A lot of ETFs track a particular market index, for example
  the ASX200. Rather than trying to outperform the index, these ‘passive’ ETFs will
  closely mirror the index performance, minus management fees.\n\n## What is an LIC?\n\nJust
  like any company listed on an exchange, an LIC is a publicly listed company itself
  (hence the name, listed investment company). The company may invest in a wide range
  of assets including but not limited to shares, property and bonds. When you invest
  in an LIC you’re buying shares in that company. You can buy and sell your shares
  in an LIC on the ASX, just like you would any public company. \n\n## Key differences
  between ETFs and LICs\n\nThere are a number of key [differences between ETFs and
  LICs](https://www.finder.com.au/share-trading/exchange-traded-funds-versus-listed-investment-companies)
  that will influence your decision as to which one is best for your portfolio.\n\n*
  **Structure.** An LIC is a company, so when you invest in an LIC you’ll own shares
  in the LIC itself, rather than the underlying assets. An ETF is a trust, so when
  you invest in an ETF you’ll receive units in the fund. Because an LIC is a company,
  the board of directors will determine the dividend payment (or decide to pay no
  dividend at all) each financial year. However an ETF must pass on all dividend earnings
  to unit holders. \n\n* **Tax implications.** If the LIC receives unfranked dividends
  from the underlying investments, it will pay tax on those dividends at the company
  tax rate and deliver [franked dividends to shareholders](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/).
  An ETF, on the other hand, passes all dividends through to unitholders in the  [Attribution
  Managed Investment Trust (AMIT) tax structure](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/).
  ETFs are also subject to the AMIT regime\n\n* **Open-ended versus closed-ended.**
  ETFs are open-ended, meaning the manager can issue more units (shares) as more investors
  buy into the ETF. While in comparison LICs are closed-ended and have a set number
  of shares on issue in the market, which means the share price will vary as a result
  of investor demand for the LIC, rather than track the value of the underlying investments
  .       \n\n* **Management.** ETFs are typically ‘passive’ investments that simply
  tracks the performance of an entire index, while an LIC has investment managers
  actively picking stocks with the intention of beating the market. \n\n* **Cost.**
  Because LICs have investment managers actively selecting which assets to invest
  in and seeking investment opportunities they believe will outperform, LICs usually
  have higher costs attached.\n\n* **Exposure.** When investing in a wide index tracking
  ETF, you get exposure to a wider pool of assets,potentially tracking several hundred
  stocks. Because LICs actively select each individual asset to invest in, they usually
  offer access to maybe 100 or 200 underlying assets at most.\n\n## Advantages of
  ETFs and LICs\n\nETFs and LICs are popular with Australian investors as they have
  a number of big advantages.\n\n●      **Low cost**. While [ETFs are usually cheaper](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-to-look-for-when-buying-etfs/),
  both LICs and ETFs are very low-cost ways to invest in a pool of assets. Looking
  at Australian equities for example, the BetaShares A200 ETF has management fees
  of just 0.07% p.a, and the popular LIC AFIC has management fees of 0.14% p.a. The
  fees will vary depending on whether the fund is passive or actively managed. Plus,
  for the one brokerage fee you get exposure to hundreds of assets.\n\n●      **Diversification.**
  Both investments offer instant diversification across hundreds of underlying assets
  in the one transaction. This not only helps to reduce risk, but also dramatically
  reduces the investment costs.\n\n●      **High liquidity.** Because they’re traded
  on a public exchange[ like regular shares](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/shares),
  a lot of ETFs and LICs enable you to easily sell your position on the exchange if
  you need the cash or want to invest elsewhere. \n\nThere are many advantages of
  investing in an ETF or LIC, or even both. Understanding the main differences between
  ETFs and LICs will help you make a better investment decision.\n\n## Track your
