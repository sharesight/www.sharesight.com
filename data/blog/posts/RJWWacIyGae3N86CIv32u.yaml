:url_slug: what-is-a-stock-transfer-agent
:content: "A stock transfer agent acts as the official record keeper for publicly
  traded companies to track the individuals and entities that own stocks and bonds
  in the company, as well as how many units each investor owns. Most transfer agents
  are banks or trust companies, but [a company may also act as its own transfer agent](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerstransferagenthtm.html).
  While this function requires a stock transfer agent in the US, it is called a share
  registry or transfer agency in other parts of the world.\n\n![Stock Transfer Agent
  USA](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/52bu8oFkp5HZS4ZDHQJzuV/75402dd29f0b4debf4770e540732e361/Stock_Transfer_Agent_USA.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What does a stock transfer agent do?\n\nA stock transfer agent acts on behalf of
  a company to manage changes in the ownership of publicly traded stocks and bonds,
  as these are bought and sold, and maintains a register of ownership. This administrative
  service helps companies keep track of the individuals and entities that own their
  stocks and bonds. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, [transfer
  agents perform three main functions](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerstransferagenthtm.html):\n\n###
  Recordkeeping to reflect changes in ownership\n\nTransfer agents are responsible
  for issuing and cancelling stock certificates as shares are bought and sold, for
  replacing lost documents and for distributing cash and stock dividend payments to
  shareholders. The agent will also keep records of who owns a company’s stocks and
  bonds and how those stocks and bonds are held. This can be an individual owner’s
  name in certificate form, a company’s name in book-entry form, or by the investor’s
  brokerage firm by street name. Shares held in ‘street name’ refers to shares which
  have a beneficial shareholder who maintains their ownership indirectly through a
  brokerage, with the broker recorded as the registered owner on the company’s books.
  The stock transfer agent also keeps records of how many shares or bonds each investor
  owns.\n\n### Act as an intermediary for the listed company\n\nThe stock transfer
  agent may take on other roles as part of its service, including paying out interest,
  [cash and stock dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/when-are-dividends-paid-by-stocks/)
  to shareholders on behalf of the client company. This role may also extend to administrative
  functions like sending out proxy materials – documents that outline how the company
  functions, voting procedures, numbers of outstanding shares, executive compensation,
  etc – and mailing out the company’s quarterly and/or annual report, acting as exchange
  agent in a merger or tendering shares as part of a tender offer. The stock transfer
  agent acts as the intermediary between the investor and the company they’ve invested
  in, so it’s important to keep track of any communications received. Depending on
  the type of stock held by the investor, they may have voting rights on major company
  decisions, and it will be the agent that passes on these details.\n\n### Assist
  with lost, destroyed, or stolen certificates\n\nTransfer agents can help investors
  when a stock or bond certificate they hold has been lost, destroyed, or stolen.
  If you find yourself in this position, the [US Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerslostcerthtm.html)
  or investor relations section of the company’s website can point you in the direction
  of the relevant stock transfer agent. Stock transfer agents in the US verify that
  shareholders are genuine through the use of signature guarantees. This is often
  referred to as a \"medallion signature guarantee\". The agent also acts as a registrar
  to ensure that the corporation does not issue more shares of stock than have been
  authorized.\n\n## What is a medallion signature guarantee?\n\nThis guarantee is
  one of several special certification stamps that guarantees a signature and authorizes
  a transfer of securities as authentic. Signatures on a stock certificate must have
  the medallion guarantee. Generally this is only required when an owner wants to
  sell or transfer securities, such as stocks or bonds, held in physical certificate
  form. If an owner holds securities through a broker, they will not need to obtain
  a signature guarantee to sell or transfer the securities. Investors can usually
  obtain a medallion signature guarantee at a financial institution where they are
  already a customer under the [Medallion signature guarantee program](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-sigguarhtm.html).
  However, the increasing preference for electronic records means few securities are
  held in physical certificate form.\n\n## What is the Direct Registration System
  for shares?\n\nAside from holding hard copy stock certificates or street name registration,
  as discussed earlier, investors can choose a third option: direct registration.
  [The Direct Registration System](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html)
  (DRS) enables the electronic transfer of securities back and forth between the issuer
  and the investor’s broker-dealer. Increasingly, new investors are investing in stocks
  through a brokerage account online and have little use for paper transactions. The
  DRS was [created in 1996](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-direct-registration-system-or-drs-for-stocks-357536)
  for investors who didn’t want their stock registered in the name of their brokerage
  firm.\n\nThe [advantage of this method](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html)
  is that, as a \"registered\" shareholder, the investor will receive reports and
  other communications directly from the company. Securities can also be sold more
  easily via the broker without the need for the investor being required to fill out
  any further paperwork. The key disadvantage is that investors may not be able to
  buy or sell at a specific market price or at a specific time.\n\n## What is the
  difference between a stock transfer agent and a broker?\n\nGenerally, transfer agents
  maintain a record of ownership, including contact information, of an issuer’s registered
  shareholders while brokers act as a custodian and maintain their own records of
  who the beneficial shareholders are of the shares registered under their street
  name. [The advantage of using a transfer agent](https://www.brokerage-review.com/expert/self-directed-vs-managed/brokerage-firm-vs-transfer-agent.aspx)
  to buy and sell a company’s stock is that it is less likely than a broker to charge
  any commissions and investors receive communications directly from the corporation,
  instead of documents going through a broker first. The disadvantage of direct registration
  is that the transfer agent may not execute an order at a specific time and so there
  is less guarantee of price.\n\nThe primary advantage of choosing to hold securities
  in \"street name\" is that the brokerage firm holds all securities from all companies
  in one account. Its role is to safeguard these electronic securities, aggregate
  them and send out all documents from all securities to investors. It should also
  be noted that not all stocks in the US can be purchased through transfer agents.
  However, the big advantage of buying stock directly from a company versus a broker
  is that it’s [usually a far cheaper option](https://www.brokerage-review.com/expert/self-directed-vs-managed/brokerage-firm-vs-transfer-agent.aspx).
  It should also be noted that the investor can maintain their relationship with the
  broker-dealer regardless of their choice of registration.\n\nWhile [brokerage firms
  and transfer agents](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html#faq)
  have procedures in place to help investors replace lost or stolen certificates,
  it is a disadvantage of this method. Another potential pitfall to be wary of is
  if an investor owns securities registered via a \"street name\" as there is the
  possibility, should the registered street name owner become insolvent, that the
  investor will not recover the shares. However, if the broker is a member of the
  [Securities Investor Protection Corporation](https://www.sipc.org/) (SIPC), investors
  are protected up to $500,000. Many brokers also carry insurance in excess of SIPC
  coverage. However, this protection does not extend to losses caused by a decline
  in the market value of securities.\n\n## Stock transfer agent US market share\n\nThe
  US market is dominated by a handful of transfer agents with little change in the
  pecking order over the last eight years. According to [2021 figures from Audit Analytics](https://blog.auditanalytics.com/transfer-agent-market-share-2020/),
  Computershare/BNY Mellon (37.4%) and American Stock Transfer & Trust (21.2%) remain
  the frontrunners in terms of market share, followed by Equiniti Trust,\n\nContinental
  Stock Transfer & Trust and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions. \n\n## Track the
