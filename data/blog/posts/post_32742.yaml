:title: What is unbundling and how much can it save me?
:url_slug: what-is-unbundling-and-how-much-can-it-save-me
:content: "If you subscribe to the financial industry trade press or keep an eye on
  Australian SMSF news you've probably come across the term \"unbundling.\" Unbundling
  refers to the surgical destruction of vertically integrated products and services
  that have been pushed by the big banks for decades. It's very real. And it's very
  possible to do.\n\nA bundled offering used to make sense. Before our \"life admin\"
  could be run across tabs in a browser, it made sense to buy our investments and
  insurance from the same place we got a home loan and did our everyday banking. Lower
  cost options probably existed, but the time and effort required to research them
  and fill out the paperwork required to switch wasn't worth it.\n\nFortunately, we
  live in the age of the informed consumer. \"Ticket clippers\" waiting in the middle
  to take their pound of flesh are disappearing or having to adapt to provide something
  of value.\n\n![Unbundling - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/193eDeKrseAckQcK4YKC2y/d08545e7e95342a6999a6f319417b212/featured_unbundling.png?w=950)\n\nLet's
  take an investor with a $500,000 portfolio and see how the costs compare.\n\n##
  The unbundled solution\n\n### 1. Execution -- CMC Markets\nTheir entry level service
  starts at $11 per trade and gets cheaper the more you execute. But, let's assume
  that 30% of the portfolio turns over annually, charged at 20 basis points. That's
  $300 in trading fees annually. We should also assume that in addition to shares,
  our investor is using ETFs, which would incur fees of their own. Let's say half
  the portfolio is invested in ETFs, which have a management fee of 0.3%. That's $750
  annually (ETF fees range from 0.2% to 0.6%).\n\n### 2. Accounting -- Xero\nOur investor
  has wisely chosen to use an accounting application. Not only will this force him
  to be more organised, it should reduce his accounting fees at tax time. [Xero Cashbook](/xero/)
  is around $15 per month, or $180 per annum (the accountant will likely bundle this
  cost into the overall fee). He'll also need to pay his accountant for their services.
  This might run $1,000 assuming a decently complex financial situation.\n\n### 3.
  Research -- Intelligent Investor\nAlways wise to get independent advice. In addition
  to company research, Intelligent Investor provides model portfolios and access to
  analysts in their Unlimited Share Advisor package for $64 per month, or $768 per
  annum.\n\n### 4. Portfolio Tracking -- Sharesight\nWhile understanding his portfolio
  tax liability is a must-do, knowing exactly where his portfolio is in terms of capital
  gains, dividends, and currency is just plain smart. And like using Xero, this should
  reduce accounting or bookkeeping costs. The [Sharesight Investor Plan](/pricing/)
  is $25 per month, or $275 for an annual subscription.\n\n### 5. Cloud Apps -- Google\nIt
  might seem like Google doesn't belong on this list, but opening a dedicated Google
  account for all-things-investing makes sense. Not only can our investor maintain
  a dedicated email account, but he can keep organised using their suite of apps:
  calendar, docs, spreadsheets, sites, and storage (Drive). All info can be shared
  with a spouse, and accountant, and so forth. And it's free! Annual cost: $0. Honestly,
  the free Google services are better than their relatively expensive Microsoft antecedents
  (Office).\n\n**The unbundled bottom line: <span style=\"color:red\">$3,093 per annum</span>**\n\nPlus,
  via Sharesight, 3 of the above service providers talk to each other, meaning admin
  work is seriously diminished. A trade made with CMC will flow to Sharesight, which
  appears in Xero. In real time. While our investor sits on the beach with a cold
  beer in hand.\n\n## The traditional bundle\nBundled solutions charge based on assets
  under management. Staying with our $500,000 example:\n\n**Execution, Research, Advice,
  and Portfolio Tracking -- Investment Platform or Wrap Account**\n\nThe selling point
  of platforms and wraps is that they do the above three things for you, but that
  comes at a cost:\n\n- Typically, you'll need to pay between 1.5% and 2% in annual
  fees for administration (that's the piece Sharesight does for $275).\n- Then there's
  the adviser fee. You can't get money onto a platform without \"hiring\" an adviser.
  They usually take another 1% to 2%.\n- Then there are the fees paid to the managers
  of the actual investment products, which sit on the platform. These run between
  0.75% and 1.5%.\n- Last there are miscellaneous one-off fees, like entry and establishment
  fees.\n\nThat totals between 3.25% and 5.5%. Most industry sources peg the cost
  of using bundled solutions between 3% and 5% annually. Conservatively, let's stick
  with 3%.\n\n**The bundled bottom line: <span style=\"color:red\">$15,000 per annum</span>**\n\nAnd
  we haven't even paid for the accounting yet! You have no control or visibility over
  your data and any performance or tax report will be mailed to you in a print-out
  that looks like it was generated on a dot-matrix printer.\n\nEven if a fee of 3%
  annually sounds palatable, when you think about this in terms of ROI (alpha) it
  looks a lot worse. Assuming returns of 8% per year, **a 3% fixed fee soaks up nearly
  40% of your return!**\n\n## Do you have to sacrifice professional advice if you
  unbundle?\nNo. It's worth noting that the unbundled scenario above does not include
  financial advice. Fortunately, there are new low-cost or fixed-fee options springing
  up. Given the money saved by unbundling, even experienced investors might allocate
  a portion of their assets to these new options. It could be worth the time savings
  alone. \n\n[Stockspot](/blog/announcing-new-strategic-partner-stockspot/), for example,
  will allocate money to a basket of ETFs and take care of the rebalancing for you.
  They charge 1.2% per annum + a $77 admin fee. If our investor allocated 20% of his
  portfolio to Stockspot that would be $1,317 per annum. Combined with the unbundled
  fees, that would still be far below $15k.\n\nUnbundling is great for those who know
  what they're doing, but it's not for everyone. Many, many people benefit greatly
  from sound financial advice. A well-intentioned, fee-for-service financial adviser
  will investigate options on your behalf both on and off platforms and wraps.\n\nIt's
  a shame that the pricing disparity illustrated above is so great. It means that
  people who don't know what they don't know are getting a raw deal.\n\n<small>*This
