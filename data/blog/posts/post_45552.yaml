:content: "Last week we presented alongside 32 other fintech companies at the [Afiniation
  Showcase](/blog/afiniation-showcase-wrap/) event in Sydney and **won the award for
  Best Technology**. We're thrilled that the hard work and ingenuity of our developers
  was recognised on such a big stage. Claudio, Felix, Michael, and Thorsten - great
  job guys!\n\n![Afiniation Award - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2uaDG88CoEsKqacY0mC4mI/7cde2f18f50fa1a4d4075a0ef5f686b6/featured_afiniation-award.png?w=950)\n\nIf
  we could pick one category to be considered for, it would always be technology.
  We're proud of the fact that we've built Sharesight front the ground up. And we're
  proud of how we've turned something complicated and painful (portfolio admin) into
  something that people genuinely enjoy doing on our product. \n\nCongrats to all
  of the presenters and especially to fellow Wellington-born company [Banqer](https://www.banqer.co)
  who were named Best in Show. And a big thank you to Afiniation!\n\nView the video
  that Afiniation has put together of all the winners:\n\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/140748938\"
