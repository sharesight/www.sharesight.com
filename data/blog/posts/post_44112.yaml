:content: |-
  Hi, I’m [Emma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmavandermaas), a Dutch customer support guru-to-be with experience as a new school customer support manager (at a Sydney-based travel agency) and old school marketing (at a newspaper in The Netherlands).

  I am excited to start my new role with [Sharesight](/) as I feel that, with the help of the Sharesight team, I can truly live up to expectation of being a Sharesight support guru. There is so much to learn, but the willingness of the Sharesight team to share their knowledge during my first week has felt like I’ve joined a family rather than a company.

  ![Emma - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5Yyu4pn916Oaoa66YKqMme/bb028c08f1fb13253b5b18f65be36e92/featured_emma.jpg?w=950)

  I never imagined working for a Fintech company. Prior to joining Sharesight, I thought investing was something only done by the very wealthy, or by financial professionals. However I’ve quickly realized that the Sharesight team makes investing available for everyone. Financial democracy!

  I very much appreciate that Sharesight loves to disrupt by offering a new and fresh solution -- this matches my solution-oriented personality. I very much look forward to making a difference in Customer Support and learning and absorbing all the knowledge that is within the Sharesight team. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmavandermaas/). I am happy to connect to talk Fintech, travelling or basketball.
