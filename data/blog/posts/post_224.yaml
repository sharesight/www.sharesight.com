:title: How do you choose which shares to buy?

  As DIY investors we all have our own strategies for achieving better than average returns by making our own investment decisions rather than putting these decisions in the hands of a ‘professional’.

  In a previous article on [why you should invest in the Sharemarket](/blog/why-you-should-invest-in-the-share-market/), I gave my top 10 tips for DIY share market investment.

  One of my tips was as follows:

  > There are innumerable share purchase recommendations for free and there are many individuals and organisations that provide recommendations to paying subscribers. They can be a valuable source of guidance and information but don’t follow them blindly. Do your own homework and come to your own decisions.

  Clearly some recommendation services are better than others, and I didn’t want to bias the article with my own personal opinions on the matter, particularly as there are probably some great services out there that I have never used and some that I have not even heard about.

  So how do you choose which shares to buy? I’m sure I’m not the only one who’d be interested to hear what services others are using and what they think of them, so here’s your chance to contribute!

  Please post your comments on which services you subscribe to, how closely you follow their recommendations, what you think of them and why.
