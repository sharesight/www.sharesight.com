:title: How investors can optimise their diversification using AI and technology
:url_slug: investors-optimise-diversification-using-ai-technology
:content: "Sharesight and Diversiview LENSELL® recently came together in a webinar
  to address the importance of portfolio diversification and how DIY investors and
  financial advisers can harness the use of technology and artificial intelligence
  (AI) to optimise diversification, improve portfolio performance, and mitigate risk.

  Investors need to balance risk and return\n\nEvery investor is different. They have
  different financial goals, risk tolerance levels, personal circumstances and duration
  to their goals, but for every investor it’s about **balancing risk and return**.\n\n![Investor
  journey risk and return](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1ehU0rP97pkPDK1HhjTu1s/f388718520407a6d9174f91264fc9fde/Investor_journey_risk_and_return.jpg?w=950)\n\nWith
  54% of investors being adverse to risk ([2020 Investor Study Report](https://www2.asx.com.au/blog/australian-investor-study)),
  the challenge is finding a more reliable way to mitigate risk for investors.\n\nWhile
  a breakdown of a portfolio’s industries, asset classes or geographies can be commonly
  found across a range of platforms, investors need a solution that will help them
  understand the risks associated with their investment portfolio. \n\n\"If you invest
  in 5, 10, 20 securities, will they go down all together when there are market disruptions
  or will some of them weather the storm better than others? Also, how do you divide
  your available funds to get the best return?\" asks Dr. Laura Rusu, CEO and Founder
  of fintech company LENSELL®.\n\nTo answer these questions and address an important
  gap in the market, Dr. Rusu developed Diversiview, a tool to empower self-directed
  investors to get better insights and make better decisions. Not to be confused with
  a robo-advisor solution, this platform gives investors a greater understanding of
  their risk profile and the decision to minimise risk or maximise returns is still
  with the investor. \n\n## Diversification is key\n\nAccording to Dr. Rusu, the media
  focus is often on returns and very little attention is given to risk, including
  common risk mitigation strategies such as diversification. This is reflected in
  investors’ priorities, with a 2020 study showing their top consideration was potential
  return at 65%, while need for diversification was only 30%. The study also found
  that 40% of investors did not have a diversified portfolio (2020 Investor Study
  Report).\n\n\"The most important thing an investor should know is how to diversify
  well\" - Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates.\n\nDr. Rusu believes to become better
  investors we must gain a better understanding of asset allocation, risk of individual
  investments and correlations between individual investments. The goal is to find
  a way to maximise return and minimise risk at the same time, and technology allows
  us to do that in a more reliable, mathematical way. \n\nAsset allocation can be
  complex and time consuming, with many potential allocations or portfolio positions.
  Diversiview’s technology can quickly crunch these numbers by combining Nobel Prize-winning
  theories and research with AI, deep learning and optimisation, delivering a risk
  and return calculated value and identifying the optimal portfolio that balances
  minimal risk with maximum return.\n\n## How technology can solve investors’ problems\n\nA
  poll taken during the webinar showed that many investors use spreadsheets to track
  their portfolio’s diversity. While this is one way to track your investments, it
  tends to be an inefficient method that doesn’t give you the full picture of your
  portfolio’s performance, diversification or risk profile, and it is not scalable.\n\nBy
  taking advantage of Sharesight’s integration with Diversiview, investors can access
  Sharesight’s award-winning performance, dividend tracking and tax reporting features,
  while also using Diversiview to analyse the health, deep diversification and the
  risk & return positions of their portfolio. This makes it easy for investors to
  build tailored, diversified portfolios that suit their risk tolerance and return
  expectations, while eliminating tedious portfolio admin and manual calculations.\n\nLearn
