  Our awesome sales and support staff are currently busy following-up and onboarding the hundreds of finance pros they met in Melbourne at Xerocon last week. It's great to have the Sydney office back together again, but we're not getting too comfortable because before we know it, we'll be packing our bags again to join the tail-end of the New Zealand Xero Roadshow. We’re thrilled to have been chosen as part of a select group of Xero Add-Ons who’ve been invited to join Xero on their tour of major cities across New Zealand.

  ![NZ Xero Roadshow - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2V6nvIKfeoesIyGQ8uUS6s/f6b43b020259a82a518d6dba207b2b5e/featured_nz-xero-roadshow.png?w=950)

  **If you're an accountant, bookkeeper or financial advisor and your clients have investment portfolios, you need [Sharesight](/).**

  Our investment portfolio admin and comprehensive reporting engine simplifies day-to-day portfolio management, provides valuable performance insights, and makes tax-time a breeze. Sharesight automates the mundane stuff: updating daily price fluctuations, recording trades as-they-happen, and incorporating corporate actions such as dividends and share splits.

  Specifically, advisors love our powerful [performance reports](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/) and charts; and our 1-click tax reports (including [Taxable Income](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/) & [FIF](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/)) are an accountant's dream. Plus, our seamless [Xero integration](/xero/) means you'll spend less time reconciling bank statements and/or chasing paperwork come tax-time. Like we said, if your clients own investments, you'll want to stop by and see Sharesight for yourself.

  Join us in the following cities:

  **Auckland** — Tuesday, 1st September

  **Wellington** — Friday, 4th September

  **Christchurch** — Tuesday, 8th September
