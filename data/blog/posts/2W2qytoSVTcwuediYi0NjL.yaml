:title: Q&A with Sharesight partner Fiftyone Capital
:content: "We talked with Scott Williams, founder and CEO/CIO of hedge fund [Fiftyone
  Capital](https://www.fiftyonecapital.com/home) about how he uses Sharesight for
  his personal investments, and how his clients benefit from being able to track the
  fund on Sharesight along with the rest of their investments.\n\n![image 0 fiftyonecapital](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/41TYWAXjOXfWikJZjIiU0h/cc332ee4aa102f50b54a80874ce83583/image_0_fiftyonecapital.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Tell us a bit about yourself. How did you get into investing? \n\nI first got into
  investing prior to my first job as a stockbroker, which I started around 2010. That’s
  when I really started to understand the need for detailed reporting. I worked as
  a stockbroker for 6 years before starting Fiftyone Capital, which is a global long-short
  hedge fund where we pool our clients’ funds and invest across the developed world.
  \n\n## Tell us about Fiftyone Capital and your role at the company.\n\nI’m the founder,
  CEO and CIO (Chief Investment Officer) of the fund. My daily role is to manage the
  investment portfolio and investment team. It’s a very rewarding industry and I'm
  passionate about offering clients a great new product. We’ve also been growing a
  great team and we continue to expand as more new investors co-invest with us.\n\n##
  How would you define your fund’s investment philosophy/strategy? \n\nWe look to
  preserve capital as our first and foremost goal, and then seek to generate double-digit
  returns by finding asymmetric investment opportunities across the developed world.
  The way we think about investing is that we like to buy value (great businesses
  at attractive valuations), while reducing our risk in holding these positions through
  periods of elevated market volatility by short-selling or betting against businesses
  we think are fundamentally impaired or have negative catalysts. We typically like
  to have a margin of safety, or positions where we feel the risk/reward is skewed
  asymmetrically in our favour.\n\n## Why did you choose to use Sharesight?\n\nWe
  use it a lot with our personal investments and have done for many years. Price data
  for our fund is also available in Sharesight with an APIR code (WAC3695AU - Progressive
  Global Fund). So for our clients using it, if they want to track the investments
  in their overall portfolio we normally suggest that they use Sharesight so they
  can see what the value of our fund is each month, as well as the value of the other
  assets they hold. And each client is different – some people prefer to see attribution
  reports, whereas others use it for tax. It can definitely be very helpful at tax
  time. \n\n## Which Sharesight feature do you find the most useful? \n\nPersonally
  my favourite feature is the ability to share your portfolio. I like that I can [share
  my portfolios with my accountant, bookkeeper, or anyone](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/).
  They get a really clear picture of what’s been happening without having to keep
  contacting me, asking me what happened here or there. It’s a very good way to keep
  records in general. \n\nI’m also in an investment club with my friends and we share
  a Sharesight portfolio that is viewable by everyone so we can all see how our investments
  are performing. We all put in $10,000 for a $100,000 portfolio quite a few years
  ago. There is a set person that does the investments and we all vote on it. We use
  Sharesight to see the cash balance from the bank account, what the investments are
  doing, how they’ve performed and keep track of everything. Then we meet on a monthly
  basis to discuss the investments and any new ideas. It really makes the whole club
  a lot of fun and very transparent with the investments. \n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n*
