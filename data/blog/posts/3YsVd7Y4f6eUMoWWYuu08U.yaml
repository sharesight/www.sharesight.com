:title: Announcing Sharesight Public Portfolios
:content: "###### UPDATE (31-05-2019): This feature is no longer publicly available.
  If you would like to build your own public portfolio, check out the [Sharesight
  API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).\n\nSo much of what makes [Sharesight](/)
  a great product is based on visibility -- whether it’s visibility across your investments,
  or visibility across your client base. \n \nWe create visibility by offering bottoms-up
  performance and tax reporting in a cloud-based product with an intuitive interface.\n\n![featured

  \nToday we’re taking this to the next level. **Sharesight Public Portfolios** is
  a new feature that we’ll be rolling out in phases. Essentially it allows for public
  access to a portfolio -- Sharesight-lite, if you will. We’re brainstorming ways
  to offer Public Portfolios to our entire client base, but to give you a sneak preview
  here’s a Public Portfolio based one of my real portfolios:\n\n![screenshot - sharesight

  plan is to use Public Portfolios to convey investment themes in our own content,
  and then begin working with key partners to help them broadcast their own portfolios.
  An example might be a research house running a model portfolio, a stockpicker publicising
  their views, a roboadviser conveying the effectiveness of their asset allocation,
  or a financial publication tracking a handful of stocks.\n \nIn fact, our launch
  partner for Public Portfolios is [The Telegraph newspaper](http://www.telegraph.co.uk),
  in the UK. \n\nTheir [Business](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/) section has
  included insightful stock commentary for decades and features the popular [Questor
  portfolio](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/questor/). Their journalists have
  rebuilt the Questor portfolio, including its history, in Sharesight and will make
  it available to their readers as a Public Portfolio. From there, readers will be
  able to sign-up for a free Sharesight account and begin to track their own portfolio(s)
  and gain access to easy-to-understand performance and tax reports.\n \n“Seeing is
  believing” and our hope is that investors everywhere benefit from the Public Portfolio
  feature. If you’d like to leverage a Public Portfolio for yourself, or have more
  questions, please <a href=\"mailto:mailto:sales@sharesight.com\">get in touch</a>.\n\n###
