  adviser or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nWhen the
  [Facebook/Cambridge Analytica data scandal broke in March 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal)
  it was clear that many so-called ‘ESG’ funds were investing in companies that did
  not share the same values as their investors.\n\nWhile some scrambled to eliminate
  Facebook from their portfolio, or justified its inclusion because of its low fossil
  fuel output, others whose portfolios only target high *[environmental, social and
  governance (ESG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance)*
  performers didn’t have it and were not surprised by the revelations.\n\nEvidence
  is mounting that companies that adopt ESG factors in their management and operations
  benefit from [improved financial outcomes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2918926),
  largely through risk reduction. VanEck research paper Sustainable Investing: The
  case for taking a sustainable approach, provides analysis of why investing in companies
  with high ESG ratings can improve returns for investors, as well as allow them to
  invest sustainably. \n\n![Investing in ESG funds](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/15enLplrTzoXnn4kwpaEcT/823dba4cc8f856867965b436c8c465d8/Investing_in_ESG_funds.jpg?w=950)\n\nEssentially,
  companies with strong ESG profiles typically enjoy enhanced corporate performance
  and financial returns – and targeting those companies can boost portfolio performance
  by reducing the risks which companies, and therefore investors, face.\n\nOn the
  other hand, not adhering to ESG factors can greatly cost companies and raise the
  risks of poor performance. High profile examples including [Volkswagen cheating
  pollution emissions tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal)
  highlight where a company’s revenue has been lost due and share price has collapsed
  due to its misconduct and poor ESG governance.\n\nIn their 2015 research paper,
  *[Finding Alpha in ESG](https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?language=ENG&format=PDF&document_id=1049893651&source_id=emcms&serialid=EH1lrEKQ2OShF3%2BmR54mSQR%2FrlqHN7EaFHaIvpgxxtE%3D)*,
  Credit Suisse found that integrating ESG factors can enhance portfolio performance
  both through lower exposure to negative risks related to ESG factors and higher
  exposure to related opportunities, which can lead to material cost advantages, improved
  efficiencies and/or new revenue sources.\n\nESG ratings are, in addition, a possible
  lead indicator of management quality in that companies which are better managers
  of ESG factors may also be better managers of shareholder capital, Credit Suisse
  said.\n\nFor investors, adopting ESG requirements in a portfolio can therefore improve
  performance by helping to minimise exposure to companies with poor ESG performance
  and thus reduce the risk of their investment not offering sustainable returns.\n\n##
  What to look for in ESG funds\n\nTargeting high ESG performers is just one way to
  identify true-to-label ESG funds. There are three factors that investors should
  look for when assessing their ESG fund:\n\n1. Does the fund target high ESG performers?\n2.
  What is the carbon footprint?\n3. Does the portfolio include good corporate citizens
  and can you tell who they are?\n\n### ESG performance\n\nA careful analysis of ESG
  metrics should have foretold of this Facebook data privacy scandal and portfolios
  which only targeted high ESG performers should have avoided it. According to MSCI,
  Facebook was \"exceptionally vulnerable to regulatory actions and user dissatisfaction
  in case of privacy and data breach. Facebook's controversial data collection and
  advertising practices have continued to trigger user complaints and regulatory actions.\"
  That was *before* the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nFor that reason, MSCI rated
  Facebook BBB on its ESG metrics, which isn’t high compared to other tech giants
  (see the table below). Facebook is a clear laggard in contrast to the A, AA and
  AAA rated companies. The social network giant should never have been included in
  any portfolio of ‘sustainable’ companies.\n\nMeasuring ESG performance requires
  rigorous analysis. Investors need to fully assess a company’s environmental, social
  and governance (ESG) footprint when making investment decisions.\n\nConsidering
  ESG factors in investment decision-making is both a quantitative and qualitative
  process. An example of a quantitative measure is assessing a company’s carbon emissions.
  With climate change one of the largest environmental challenges of the 21st century,
  stock exchanges around the world and investors are increasingly requiring companies
  to report their carbon dioxide emissions (CO₂e), which can be identified and measured.
  \n\nSeparately, careful analysis is required of a company’s policies, procedures
  and practices. Considerations as varied as labour standards, workplace diversity,
  efficient use of scarce resources, risk controls and management competency are part
  of a company’s social and governance footprint. This may be assessed through qualitative
  analysis and in some cases, quantitative measures. \n\n[MSCI](https://www.msci.com/)
  is a leading global ESG researcher which rates companies on a ‘AAA’ to ‘CCC’ scale
  according to their exposure to industry specific ESG risks and their ability to
  manage those risks relative to peers. Well before Facebook’s latest troubles, MSCI
  [had warned that data breaches and regulatory action were potential problems](https://www.vaneck.com.au/esgi-one-step-ahead-of-facebooks-failure)
  for Facebook, hence its BBB rating, lower than that of its peers. \n\n<table>\n

  to measure the carbon intensity of a portfolio. Carbon intensity measures the efficiency
  of a portfolio in terms of carbon emissions per dollar of sales. While some ESG
  products contain exclusions they may fail to exclude companies that own fossil fuel
  reserves, or emit high levels of carbon. As the table below shows, the difference
  in carbon intensity between VanEck Vectors MSCI International Sustainable Equity
  ETF (ESGI), which tracks, the state-of-the-art MSCI World ex Australia ex Fossil
  Fuel Select SRI and Low Carbon Capped Index, and two other broad sustainable international
  ETFs.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>ETF</td>\n    <td>Carbon Intensity\n(tons CO2e/US$m

  VanEck, MSCI ESG Research LLC 31 October 2019, Competitor ETF</small>\n\nIf you
  are concerned with your portfolio’s carbon footprint you should invest in a portfolio
  with a low carbon intensity.\n\n### Good corporate citizens and transparency\n\nTransparency
  and ESG investing should go hand in hand. You should be able to look at the holdings
  of your ESG portfolio every day and be comfortable that the portfolio holdings are
  in line with your own values. Among the most common anti-social and irresponsible
  activities companies can be involved in are:\n\n1. alcohol;\n2. gambling;\n3. tobacco;\n4.
  military weapons;\n5. civilian firearms; and\n6. adult entertainment. \n\nIf you
  cannot view the list of your ESG portfolio’s holdings to conduct your own due diligence,
  then your so-called ESG fund may have something to hide.\n\nMany active fund managers
  incorporate ESG factors into their risk analysis. However, the challenge for many
  investors has been combining the inclusion of ESG leaders, exclusion of fossil fuels
  and carbon criminals and the exclusion of companies involved in anti-social or irresponsible
  activities into one portfolio. Many investments do only one or two of these. It
  has been particularly hard for passive managers, who track indices, to include effective
  qualitative ESG research. \n\nVanEck’s two sustainable ETF meet all the requirements
  of responsible investing, including thorough ESG analysis. The holdings of all VanEck’s
  ETFs are available on our website, including our ESG focused,[ VanEck Vectors MSCI
  International Sustainable Equity ETF (ESGI)](https://www.vaneck.com.au/funds/esgi/snapshot/)
  and the[ VanEck Vectors MSCI Australian Sustainable Equity ETF (GRNV)](https://www.vaneck.com.au/funds/grnv/snapshot/).\n\nIn
  addition, we also make available a quarterly report to investors which outlines
  the carbon intensity and ESG exposure of these two portfolios:\n\n* ESGI\n\n* GRNV\n\n###
