:content: "Sharesight’s Multi-Currency Valuation Report is built for the needs of
  investors who invest across global markets and who think in terms of more than one
  currency when making investment decisions. This report allows investors to see the
  value of every investment in their portfolio denominated in both the currency it
  is traded in as well as its value when converted to any of the 75+ currencies (including
  crypto) in Sharesight using the end-of-day value and prevailing forex rate on any
  date selected.\n\nThis report is perfect for investors who want to see their investments
  denominated in any other currency than that of their tax residency, with a range
  of powerful features, such as the ability to group by different dimensions including
  currency, with the sub-total value calculated across all holdings in each investment
  currency.\n\nTo find out more about how Sharesight’s Multi-Currency Valuation Report
  helps global investors get the best picture of their investments, keep reading.\n\n##
  Think in terms of the currency of your choice\n\nIf you’re an international investor
  who invests primarily in US stocks, you will tend to ‘think’ in terms of US dollars
  when investing, the Multi-Currency Valuation Report allows you to view all of your
  investments valued in US dollars, or any of the [75+ currencies Sharesight supports](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-investments-in-fx-currencies-with-sharesight/).\n\n![Value

  the value of your investments denominated in the currency of your choice</small>\n\n###
  See the value of your investments in Bitcoin\n\nWant to see the value of the investments
  in your portfolio in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency? The Multi-Currency Valuation
  Report can do that too.\n\n![Value your investments in bitcoin](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/nOya8lNSMGjDOsaZbq9Db/6972d28f8332ee6f462c25edd1cff852/Value_your_investments_in_bitcoin.png?w=950)\n\n<small>View
  the value of your investments in Bitcoin</small>\n\n## See the value of every investment
  in its domestic currency\n\nIf you invest across multiple global markets, plus cryptocurrencies,
  the Multi-Currency Valuation Report makes it easy to see the price, units held,
  and total value of every investment held in your portfolio denominated in its domestic
  currency as at any date in time in your portfolio history.\n\n## Break-down your
  portfolio values by currency\n\nThe Multi-Currency Valuation Report allows investors
  to break down the results of the report by various dimensions such as the market,
  country, currency, sector, industry or any of your [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  defined according to your needs.\n\nWhen grouped by currency, the Multi-Currency
  Valuation Report provides sub-totals for each investment currency, which will be
  valuable for investors who need a snapshot of their investment allocation by country
  for tax purposes, or when considering trading in to or out of positions denominated
  in a particular currency.\n\n![Value your portfolio in multiple currencies](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7GQLLcbQG7B2PWzMCeAsru/31817d812b9544e710d5e83cc7d3d4bb/Value_your_portfolio_in_multiple_currencies.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Multi-Currency

  Calculate asset values and exchange rates for tax purposes\n\nOne of the features
  of the Multi-Currency Valuation Report is particularly beneficial for investors
  who need to record the year-end values and exchange rates on their investments when
  filing their taxes, such as [SMSFs in Australia](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Administering-and-reporting/Value-the-fund-s-assets/).\n\nTo
  do this, simply run the Multi-Currency Report by selecting the final date of the
  financial year, this will calculate the year-end asset values as well as display
  the relevant exchange rates of all your investments held on the date in question.\n\n##
