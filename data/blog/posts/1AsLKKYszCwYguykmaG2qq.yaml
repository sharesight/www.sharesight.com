:title: Sharesight now has an Amazon Alexa Skill
:content: "For anyone with an Amazon Echo, you can now ask Alexa how your shares are
  doing by adding the Sharesight Alexa Skill.\n\nThe team at Sharesight love technology,
  so we were excited to hear from a [developer who wanted to build an Alexa Skill](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/qa-with-sharesight-alexa-skill-developer--russell-dear/)
  using the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) to allow investors
  to check their investment portfolio performance using Amazon Alexa voice commands.\n\nIf
  you own an Amazon Alexa device (such as the Echo or Echo Dot) -- it’s easy to add
  the skill to your device and connect your Sharesight account.\n\n![featured - Sharesight

  How to use the Sharesight Alexa Skill\n\nTo get started, you’ll need a Sharesight
  account ([sign up for free](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)) and to have
  [added holdings](https://help.sharesight.com/setting-up-your-holdings/) to your
  portfolio. It goes without saying that you’ll also need an Amazon Alexa device.\n\nYou’ll
  need to visit [Amazon’s Sharesight Alexa Skill](https://www.amazon.com/Russell-Dear-Sharesight/dp/B078P69Z3L)
  page to ‘enable’ the Skill, or alternatively you can find the Skill by searching
  in the [Alexa app](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602060)
  for Sharesight. \n\nWhen you ‘enable’ the Skill, you will be asked to link Alexa
  to your Sharesight account using the Sharesight API (you can revoke this access
  at any time from the \"Account Settings\" page).\nOnce linked, you can interact
  with with Alexa to check your Sharesight portfolio. \n\nWatch this video demonstrating
  the Sharesight Skill to see how it works:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1IGz_7Sgj-8?rel=0\"

  content: https://www.youtube.com/embed/1IGz_7Sgj-8?rel=0</a>\n\n__Client:__ “Alexa,
  ask Sharesight how my portfolio is doing”<br>\n__Alexa’s response__ “Portfolio X
  has a total gain of $2390 or 3.25%. It’s current value is $191,456.”\n\nThe Sharesight
  Skill has been registered to work in all of the English-speaking markets in which
  Amazon sells Alexa products (Currently English -- AU, CA, GB, IN, US). Other languages
  may be added in the future.\n\n## Sharesight Alexa Skill FAQ\n\n### Who developed
  the Sharesight Alexa Skill?\n\nThe [Sharesight Alexa Skill](https://www.amazon.com/Russell-Dear-Sharesight/dp/B078P69Z3L)

  his Sharesight investment portfolio. Russell built the Sharesight Skill in a personal
