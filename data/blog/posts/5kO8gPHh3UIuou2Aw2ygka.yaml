:title: Get on top of your FY2017-18 corporate actions
:content: "Now is the perfect time to ensure any corporate actions you are impacted
  by are accurately recorded within your Sharesight portfolio. As we’ve previously
  written, [corporate actions greatly impact portfolio performance](/blog/corporate-actions-and-your-investment-performance/),
  \ and because your broker doesn’t take corporate actions into account, their [performance
  numbers can mislead you](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/).\n\n![portfolio

  Catch-up on complex corporate actions\n\nFortunately the vast majority of day-to-day
  corporate actions (such as dividends and share splits) are automatically incorporated
  by [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/). Here are the more complex corporate
  actions that may require you to take additional steps to ensure they are correctly
  recorded within your Sharesight portfolio:\n\n### Corporate actions news\n\n- [Xero
  (XRO) shares listing solely on the ASX](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/xero-shares-listing-solely-on-the-asx--a-guide/)\n-

  the [Merge Holding feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-merge-holding-feature/)
  which allows you to manage most of the day-to-day corporate actions encountered
  in Australia (and other markets). For detailed help on using this feature, please
