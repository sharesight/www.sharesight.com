:title: What is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?
:url_slug: compound-annual-growth-rate-cagr
:content: "The Compound Annual Growth Rate or CAGR is one measure of an investment’s
  [annual growth rate over time](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp), including
  the impact of compounding. It is one of several metrics that can be used by investors
  to measure and compare the past performance of investments or to project their expected
  future returns. Here we look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of this
  method.\n\n ![What is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5BCjXWVx2hMFskqKV6tLcp/d6c63d5c9a7283c544db8bafa054dd92/What_is_the_Compound_Annual_Growth_Rate__CAGR_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What Is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?\n\nA compound annual growth rate
  (CAGR) measures the rate of return for an investment — such as a mutual fund or
  bond — over any given investment timeframe. The CAGR is one of the most accurate
  ways to calculate and determine returns for any asset that can rise or fall in value
  over time. This metric is also known as a [\"smoothed\" rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/compound-annual-growth-rate-what-you-should-know/)
  because it measures the growth of an investment as if it had grown at a steady rate
  on an annually compounded basis. Investors can then compare the CAGR of two or more
  investments within, or across different asset classes to assess how they performed
  against each other, or alternatively benchmark against the performance of a market
  index. This ability to evaluate performance across multiple investments can give
  the CAGR method an advantage over other rates of return.\n\n## What is the CAGR
  used for?\n\nThe CAGR is a mathematical formula that lets investors know what an
  investment yields on an annually compounded basis. It is widely considered to be
  the best formula for evaluating how different investments have performed over time.
  The CAGR can also be used to compare the historical returns of stocks to bonds or
  a savings account. However, it should be noted that the CAGR is only useful in comparing
  investments over the same time periods and does not reflect investment risk. CAGR
  assumes [a constant growth rate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/cagr?r=US&IR=T)
  across the period being assessed, by smoothing volatile or inconsistent investment
  growth, it’s much easier to compare different investments or to track the performance
  of a specific investment.\n\n## What is the CAGR formula?\n\nTo calculate the CAGR,
  an investor essentially just needs three data points: the beginning value of the
  investment; the end value of the investment; and the number of years of the investment
  was held. To [calculate the CAGR of an investment](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/what-is-cagr/)
  one divides the value at the end of the investment period by its value at the beginning
  of that period. Then raise the result to an exponent of one divided by the number
  of years, and subtract one from the subsequent result. \n\nAs an example, consider
  an investor who has invested $1,000 in a particular fund, which is then worth $1,850
  after three years. In absolute terms, the fund has nearly doubled the initial stake
  in generating a return of 85% over the three years. However, this can be misleading
  and is a case where applying CAGR is a useful exercise. By applying CAGR: *(1850/1000)^(1/3)
  – 1*, one gets 23%. In other words, the investment in the fund has yielded an average
  return of 23% every year over the last three years. This is the compounded return
  earned on an annual basis irrespective of the individual yearly performances of
  the fund.\n\n## CAGR vs Internal Rate of Return\n\nThe Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
  is also an important tool to calculate returns from an investment. However, it is
  often more complex to calculate and more useful in more difficult situations comprising
  many factors. These situations may involve multiple cash inflow and outflow events
  that are not possible to calculate using the CAGR. Put another way, while CAGR is
  easier to calculate, IRR can cope with [more complicated situations](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070914/what-are-main-differences-between-compound-annual-growth-rate-cagr-and-internal-rate-return-irr.asp).
  The calculation of IRR makes use of the time period of the investment and the cash
  flows over that time period. To do so, the investor needs to calculate the discount
  rate or the IRR at which the Net Present Value of the investment becomes zero.\n\n##
  What Is Risk-Adjusted CAGR?\n\nTo compare the performance and risk characteristics
  among various investment alternatives, investors can use a [risk-adjusted CAGR](https://thepressfree.com/compound-annual-growth-rate-cagr-definition/).
  A simple method for calculating risk-adjusted CAGR is to multiply the CAGR by one
  minus the investment’s standard deviation. If the standard deviation (the amount
  of risk) is zero, then the risk-adjusted CAGR is unaffected. The larger the standard
  deviation, the lower the risk-adjusted CAGR will be.\n\n## Can you calculate CAGR
  using a spreadsheet?\n\nIt’s possible to calculate CAGR using a spreadsheet, however
  there is no built-in CAGR formula and you will need to set this up yourself, manually
  adding your data every time you want to calculate CAGR under a different scenario.
  By using an automated online portfolio tracker like Sharesight, you can easily compare
  the performance of your shares over different time periods. \n\nFor example, Sharesight
  users have the option to set their portfolio’s [annualised performance calculation
  method](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  to ‘simple’ or ‘compound’. This means that users can choose whether their returns
  are calculated based on the principles of a simple annualised return or by using
  a compound annual growth rate (CAGR), along with the time period over which investment
  performance is calculated. Calculating the CAGR of your investments is also made
  easier than ever with Sharesight’s ability to automatically track all of your investments
  in one place, eliminating the need for manual data entry and complex spreadsheets.
