:title: Canadian Capital Gains Tax Report makes tax time easy
:content: "Sharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/ca/capital_gains/)
  is the ultimate CGT calculator for Canadian investors. A convenient way to save
  time and money on your taxes, the report automatically calculates your CGT obligations
  and can be easily shared with an accountant or financial advisor. You can also run
  the report at any time, over any selected period, which means fewer surprises when
  the next tax season rolls around. \n\nThe [Sharesight Canadian CGT Report](https://help.sharesight.com/ca/capital_gains/)
  calculates capital gains (and losses) made on investments (including foreign cash
  holdings) according to[ Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/calculating-reporting-your-capital-gains-losses.html)
  using the ‘adjusted cost base (ACB)’ sale allocation method, and is available in
  our [Investor and Expert plans](https://www.sharesight.com/pricing/).\n\n![CandianCGTReport

  Why calculate your capital gains with Sharesight’s Canadian CGT Report?\n\nNot only
  are capital gains a requirement for Canadian tax reporting, but they are also an
  important factor in [calculating your portfolio’s returns](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/).
  Without using a CGT calculator, however, it can be difficult and time-consuming
  to accurately keep track of capital gains in your portfolio. While most brokers
  provide investors with some of the information they need to calculate their own
  capital gains, it becomes complicated for investors with large portfolios, especially
  those who trade frequently, have foreign investments or trade through more than
  one broker. Sharesight’s [CGT calculator](https://help.sharesight.com/ca/capital_gains/)
  is just one of many [convenient features](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  that can help Canadians save time and money on their investments and [taxes](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-ways-sharesight-helps-canadians-at-tax-time/).
  \n\n## How to calculate your CGT with Sharesight\n\n### 1. Sign up for a Sharesight
  account\n\nIf you’re not already using Sharesight, [sign up for a free account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  to start tracking your investments. \n\n### 2. Import your holdings\n\nUse Sharesight’s
  broker import function to add holdings from 12 leading Canadian brokers (plus more
  than 150 global brokers), including [Questrade](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-your-questrade-trades-into-sharesight/),
  [Qtrade Investor](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-qtrade-investor-stock-trades-using-sharesight/)
  and [CIBC Investor’s Edge](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-cibc-investors-edge-trades-using-sharesight/).
  Alternatively, you can add your holdings manually or via a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  \n\n### 3. Confirm your tax settings\n\nBecause Sharesight allows you to track multiple
  portfolios (tax entities) that may involve different tax settings (for instance,
  RRSP/RFIP portfolios), you will want to confirm/update your portfolio’s discount
  rate before running the CGT Report. To do that, go to Settings > [Tax Settings](https://help.sharesight.com/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/).\n\n###
  4. Run the Canadian Capital Gains Tax Report\n\nFrom the Reports menu, select the
  [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/ca/capital_gains/). You will
  have the option to set a custom date range or choose from preset options such as
  the current or last financial year. \n\n![image 1 CanadianCGT](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5F88QF8yiPQDjYLaPDgtoY/d774bfb12e83df7cbb74b7774b0377f5/image_1_CanadianCGT.png?w=950)\n\n###
  5. Review your report\n\nThe CGT Report will give you a breakdown of any capital
  gains and losses over your chosen period. \n\n![image 2 CanadianCGT](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Jdv0sGscQFGtiGH8D2bnp/b25a74f0f35ad9f65c3c79b53cfb200a/image_2_CanadianCGT.png?w=950)\n\n###
  6. Carry forward your losses\n\nYou may also choose to carry forward any losses
  from the previous reporting period. \n\n![image 3 CanadianCGT](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/64fqafHQAc5ipAigwK3sin/989710090313ca3ed27477992b4eeabe/image_3_CanadianCGT.png?w=950)\n\n###
  7. Download your CGT Report\n\nThe CGT Report can be downloaded to a range of different
  file formats, including Excel, PDF and Google Sheets, which makes it easy to [share
  with your accountant](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/).
