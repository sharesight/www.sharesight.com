:title: 'Xerocon Auckland 2014: from sheep to shares'
:url_slug: xerocon-auckland-2014-from-sheep-to-shares
:content: "Three from the [Sharesight](/) crew spent last week in Auckland for Xerocon
  NZ 2014. The verdict was unanimous, the event was a smashing success. And not just
  because of the waterfront setting, the Olympic athletes in attendance, or the free
  beer. Since Sharesight was originally built and run out of Wellington, we (and the
  [Xero](https://www.xero.com) team who do so much to support us) have a bit of a
  head start in New Zealand. Accountants and advisers on that side of the Tasman are
  well into the cloud space by this point and their knowledge and expectations of
  Xero Add-On Partners is commensurate. We don't spend much time talking about how
  [our beautiful Xero integration works](/xero/) versus time spent talking investing
  and Sharesight features. \n\n![Xerocon Auckland 2014 - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/38xFrYJgMMcuKiMc0ECeuw/93a2425ae086b88a8e9c2e6a7c6ae1c1/featured_xerocon-auckland-2014.png?w=950)\n\nWe
  had a ton of traffic at our booth (yeah, yeah, the below photo was taking during
  setup), met a lot of clients, and generated hundreds of new leads. I think it's
  fair to say we managed to wow the crowd with our automated [FIF reporting](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/)
  feature too. During our presentation, we covered basic Sharesight functionality,
  but there was an audible gasp when we showed that not only do we keep tabs on which
  shares are FIF eligible, we also run the calculations on the fly and allow you to
  drill down into the worksheets and export the data. One Xero Partner told us that
  our FIF feature will save him 30 hours of admin.\n\n![Xerocon Auckland 2014](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3Q4ncmyL3yiWQ4O0WKkg06/4f3cea3ad7de067be2c3aaedafdb1c35/xerocon-auckland-2014-booth.png?w=950)\n\nRod
  Dury and Team Xero covered a lot of ground over two days. Check out the highlights
  over on the [Xero blog](https://www.xero.com/blog/). Much was made about their push
  into the farming sector. What's striking is Xero is so flexible and wide-ranging
  that you can [manage your sheep inventory](https://www.figured.com) and track share
  dividends all in once place. That's not hyperbole. We have a lot of farmers for
  clients! Their temperament makes them good investors.\n\nAny tech company with a
  story like Xero's, a share price to match, and a founder as dynamic as Rod is bound
  to generate a lot of press and raise a few eyebrows. First off, their app is terrific.
  Secondly, they're genuine in their pursuit to empower the accountants, advisors,
  and SMEs using their product. They're essentially helping to unleash thousands of
  small business owners and entrepreneurs so they can save time, optimise their services,
  and cheesy as it sounds -- live life on their terms. This was a repeated theme throughout
  the conference.\n\nThis event, primarily due to the quality of attendees, will be
  tough to beat. We're keen to see how far along Australian-based accountants and
  advisers have come at Xerocon Australia in August.\n\n**Many thanks to Xero and
  all of the Sharesight clients we met last week!**\n\n![Xerocon Auckland 2014](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7tBJ3r0l3yOY4kok0CSUwy/eb4443324a111e1bdd8a3a11258ec028/xerocon-auckland-2014-food-truck.png?w=950)\n\n###
