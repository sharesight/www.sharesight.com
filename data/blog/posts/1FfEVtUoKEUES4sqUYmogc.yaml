  Park is an automated investment management service (frequently referred to as a
  \ “robo-advisor\"), that is differentiated by the experience and calibre of its
  active [Advisory Board](https://www.sixpark.com.au/about-us/advisors-team). They
  provide a low-cost, diversified approach to investing by using ETFs. Their philosophy
  centres on not trying to pick stocks or time the market, but rather on the [Modern
  Portfolio Theory](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp)
  to automatically manage client portfolios. It’s telling that the people who founded
  the company originally come from the lofty world of institutional finance - they
  now how financial products are packaged and can combine their experience with technology
  to provide a low-cost investment strategy for just about anyone.  \n\nSix Park will
  also make use of the Sharesight API to enhance their own client interface. This
  is a terrific example of what’s possible when developers use Sharesight as a platform.\n\n![hero

  continues to gain momentum around the world. Even if you prefer to manage your own
  portfolio, it’s certainly a positive development that millions of previously unadvised
  people now have access to low cost, online financial advice.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n-
