:url_slug: sharesies
:content: "We’re excited to announce that [Sharesies](http://www.sharesies.co.nz)
  is now directly integrated with Sharesight using the Sharesight API! This means
  that investors who use the Sharesies platform can have their trades automatically
  synced to their Sharesight portfolio—making it even easier to take advantage of
  Sharesight’s award-winning performance and tax reporting.\n\n![Sharesight Blog Image

  Who is Sharesies?\n\nSharesies’ purpose is to create financial empowerment for everyone.
  It’s a massive advocate for sharing the opportunity, knowledge, and love of investing.
  The Sharesies platform gives investors the opportunity to develop their wealth over
  the long term.\n\nThrough the Sharesies platform you can invest in thousands of
  companies and funds across New Zealand, the US, and Australia—with no minimum investment!\n\n![hero

  \ Why investors should connect Sharesight and Sharesies\n\n* **Complete integration**
  — The Sharesies platform is fully integrated with the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).
  This means Sharesies transactions are automatically synced to your Sharesight portfolio
  with no need for any ongoing admin on your part. \n\n* **Track your Sharesies Portfolio
  along with the rest of your investments** — If you have investments outside of the
  Sharesies platform (such as property, crypto, or anything else), connecting Sharesies
  and Sharesight makes it easy to track all of your investments in one place, including
  the 240,000+ stocks, ETFs and funds that Sharesight supports.\n\n* **Generate in-depth
  tax reports** — Sharesies provides you with a tax statement at the end of the financial
  year, but if you need additional tax information to file your tax return, Sharesight
  can generate other in-depth reports to help you calculate any tax owed, such as
  the [Taxable Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report),
  [CGT Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors)
  (AU) and [FIF Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income)
  (NZ). You can also easily share your Sharesight portfolio with an accountant, which
  saves you from forwarding your tax documents separately.\n\n## Connecting your Sharesies
  Portfolio to Sharesight \n\nYou can connect your Sharesies Portfolio to Sharesight
  within the Sharesies app. Head to **Settings > Portfolio > Connect your Portfolio
  to Sharesight** and [follow the steps](https://help.sharesight.com/sharesies/) to
  connect to a new or existing Sharesight account. You’ll have the option to sync
  your historical Sharesies trades to Sharesight through this process, and once you’re
  connected, ongoing trades are synced to Sharesight automatically.\n\n## Get started
  with Sharesies today\n\nInterested in investing in New Zealand, US, and Australian
  share markets through the Sharesies platform? You can [sign up on the Sharesies
  website*](https://www.sharesies.nz). From there, you can link your Sharesies Portfolio
  to your Sharesight account using the instructions above. \n\n*[*Ts and Cs and fees
