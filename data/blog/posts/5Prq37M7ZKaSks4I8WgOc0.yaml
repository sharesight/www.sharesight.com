:content: "###### This post is from 2018, Sharesight has [updated AMIT ETF distribution
  information for ETFs and Funds for the 2020/2021 tax year](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/australian-etf-distribution-components-now-available-for-fy20-21/).\n\nThis
  is the time of year when investors will be receiving their annual year-end tax statements
  from both listed and unlisted investment trusts, such as [ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/)
  and managed funds. If you have had a close look, you will likely find some significant
  changes for the 2018 tax year.\n\nAustralian investors face some new and potentially
  complex tasks when completing the *[Tax Return for Individuals 2018](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-return/2018/In-detail/Publications/Tax-return-for-individuals-2018/?=redirected)*
  for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), particularly if they earn income from
  managed trusts.\n\nIn 2016 the Australian Government introduced new laws that changed
  the taxation of Managed Investment Trusts (MITs), in particular the treatment of
  tax-deferred income. This created a new trust structure known as an Attribution
  Managed Investment Trust (AMIT) which has new tax implications for investors. \n\nFortunately
  [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/) handles the changes to trust taxation
  introduced with Attribution Managed Investment Trusts. If you record the AMIT cost
  base increase and decrease components for AMIT holdings, Sharesight will correctly
  adjust the cost base and takes this into account when you run [Sharesight’s Capital
  Gains Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-2017-2018-capital-gains-tax/)
  and [Taxable Income Reports](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/improved-taxable-income-report-for-australian-investors/).\n\n##
  What is an Attribution Managed Investment Trust (AMIT)?\n\nTo understand Attribution
  Managed Investment Trusts, let’s start with what Managed Investment Trusts (MITs)
  are. A MIT is a trust structure that allows investors to purchase ‘units’ in the
  trust as a vehicle to the investment activities the trust undertakes. Typically
  Managed Investment Trusts will invest in shares, bonds, or property, with the income
  earned from those investments distributed to unit holders. MITs are considered trusts
  and income earned is taxed according to [Division 6 of the Income Tax Assessment
  Act 1936](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/trusts/in-detail/managed-investment-trusts/managed-investment-trusts---overview/).\n\nIn
  2016 the Australian Government sought to make changes to the taxation of trusts
  to make Managed Investment Trust administration simpler, reduce administration costs
  and make the sector more competitive internationally. To do this MITs became a distinct
  trust structure, that would no longer be taxed the same as a traditional trust --
  such as a family trust. The new structure is known as an Attribution Managed Investment
  Trust (AMIT).\n\nExisting MITs that elected to apply to the regime can become Attribution
  Managed Investment Trusts. Under this regime trustees can now “attribute” taxable
  income to investors, without the need to make a distribution payment to unit holders.
  In effect, AMITs no longer need to pass through all the income immediately, as is
  the case with traditional trusts.\n\nThese attribution changes mean that under the
  AMIT regime there are changes to how the cost base is handled. Previously MIT taxation
  only allowed unit holders to record cost base decreases for [CGT-exempt or tax-deferred
  payments](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/Non-assessable-payments-in-relation-to-shares-and-units/Trust-non-assessable-payments-(CGT-event-E4)/).
  Under the AMIT regime it is now possible to record a cost base increase for units
  in cases where the “attributed” (which is where the A in AMIT comes from) taxable
  income exceeds the distribution paid to the unit holder. This will occur in cases
  where income is reinvested by the trust.\n\n## How Sharesight makes AMIT tax calculations
  easy\n\nSharesight has custom fields that allow AMIT unit holders to correctly record
  the Trust Income components for these investments. This includes fields for the
  new AMIT cost base decrease, and AMIT cost base increase adjustments which feed
  into both Sharesight’s Capital Gains Tax report calculations and the Taxable Income
  Report for Australians completing their *Tax Return for Individuals 2018* form.\n\nBelow
  is a real 2018 AMMA (AMIT Member Annual) statement that breaks down the multiple
  trust income components required by the ATO. Once entered into the corresponding
  fields in Sharesight (shown) the rest is easy:\n\n![AMITCostBaseDecreaseExample5](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4z6xm7zQw1Nx468U7US8Ib/8f2dadf0aabc5e8f28a80dcb6cd956d3/AMITCostBaseDecreaseExample5.PNG)\n\n__IMPORTANT:__
  When you receive your AMMA statement, make sure you double check the component breakdowns
  against the values automatically suggested by Sharesight, as these values are likely
  to be updated in the year-end tax statement and won’t include any AMIT cost base
  increase or decrease that applies.\n\n![ETF Distributions 2018](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2NXEGU1zvqY4GS28C8Yceg/362cb492c4ef79b22a92ff2f5a8a8a23/ETF_Distributions_2018.png?w=950)\n\nSharesight
  now has updated year-end values available for ETFs on the Computershare registry
  that you can double check against your statements, but for trusts on other registries
  it is important to update these values manually yourself. Distributions that do
  not yet have updated component values are marked with a warning icon per the screenshot
  above. \n\n## How AMIT cost base adjustments impact investment returns\n\nSharesight
  takes into account both AMIT cost base increase and decrease components when calculating
  investment performance. Here’s how it works in each scenario.\n\n### AMIT cost base
  decrease\n\nWhen calculating performance Sharesight __adds the AMIT cost base decrease
  component to your gross dividend__ given that it represents cash received that was
  not attributed to you. \n\n### AMIT cost base increase\n\nWhen calculating performance
  Sharesight __deducts the AMIT cost base increase from your gross dividend__ given
  that it reduces your attributed income to the net cash amount you actually received.
