:title: 'Investment diversification: Why does it matter?'
:content: "According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp),
  diversification is a risk management technique that mixes a wide variety of investments
  within a portfolio. The rationale behind this technique contends that a portfolio
  constructed of different kinds of investments will, on average, yield higher returns
  and pose a lower risk than any individual investment found within the portfolio.\n\nThe
  popular saying goes “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. This is true of investments
  as is true of everything else in life. Economist Harry Markotwitz popularised this
  approach to investing in the 1950s-60s, with his [Nobel Peace prize-winning theory](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economics/1990/press-release/)
  that investors should construct portfolios based on various risk categories.\n\n##
  What are the types of investment diversification?\n\nThere are broadly 5 different
  styles of diversification possible across various dimensions of investing. \n\n1.
  __Diversification across companies:__ Betting all your money on a single company
  is not a good idea, even if it’s your own! With access to ETFs, LICS, managed funds
  or even a crypto ETF, it’s become extremely easy to access and purchase these instruments.
  \n2. __Diversification across industries:__ Different industries have their own
  peaks, demands and troughs. Investors tend to build a local visibility approach
  to their portfolio. For example, investors in Western Australia might develop a
  bias for mining companies, and those in Sydney might have a bias towards financial
  services. \n3. __Diversification across asset classes -- shares, bonds, deposits,
  real estate, crypto, FX:__ Preferences for particular types of investments are personal
  choices. But looking at it rationally, it’s important to understand the performance
  of the underlying components. Many media and armchair commentators would make you
  believe that one particular type of asset class is a silver bullet. A lot of these
  ‘investment trends’ are driven by media hype cycles. It’s important to undertake
  a fundamental analysis of any investment with the aim to understand risks and rewards.
  There are always fringe investments that make headlines one way or another. The
  general rule should be that if something looks too good to be true, it usually is.
  \n4. __Diversification across geographies -- markets, countries:__ Although global
  markets seem to be increasingly correlated and take cues from each other, there
  are huge benefits to be able to access other markets. This is the trend driving
  investors from smaller markets such as Australia and New Zealand, which represent
  a mere 2% of global equities, to invest the global markets -- [through ETFs and
  other instruments](https://www.firstlinks.com.au/smsf-investment-trends/).\n5. __Diversification
  through time:__ When you buy parcels of investments over time, it averages out the
  cost of bad timing. Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is a strategy some investors use
  to reduce risk. It involves investing the same amount of money in a particular investment
  during regular time intervals. For example, buying $1,000 worth of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
  shares on the first of each month. With dollar cost averaging, you purchase more
  shares when the price is low and less when the price is high. This essentially takes
  away the emotional aspect of investing because you are less concerned about market
  fluctuations. Read this blog post by my colleague, Emily, on the difference in outcomes
  and results she achieved. \n\n## What are the arguments against diversification?\n\nIn
  life, we are often told that “focus” or concentration is important. Are there people
  who have put all their eggs in one basket and made it big? Absolutely! You read
  about the rags-to-riches property and crypto billionaires and you might be tempted
  to think that ‘picking the right horse’ is the way to go about it. But, as it sounds,
  it’s like gambling -- where you can only pick one winner. Access to diversified
  ETFs and even geographical diversification is really easy now. So, why wouldn’t
  you do it?\n\n## How do you track investment diversification?\n\nYou could set up
  a spreadsheet with all your holdings and add their current values into columns and
  then chart the values to visualise the diversity of your portfolio. This would involve
  \ either constantly updating the spreadsheet with the latest prices of the assets,
  or building an API to connect with various information providers -- such as stock
  exchanges, share registries and online brokers.\n\nAs a user of Sharesight, I get
  to visualise my portfolio and the diversity of my holdings using the [Diversity
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/). It provides a visual breakdown
  of your portfolio by various default groupings such as Market, Sector, Investment
  Type, Country, as well as any [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-custom-groups/)
