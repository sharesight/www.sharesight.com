:title: 2018 Sharesight stock picking competition -- details
:content: "While we aren’t __yet__ at the finish line for the [2017 Sharesight Stock
  Picking Competition](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition/).
  It’s time to start thinking about your pick for the 2018 Sharesight Stock Picking
  Competition!\n\n## What was the 2017 Sharesight Stock Picking Competition?\n\nLeading
  up to the start of 2017 we asked Australia and New Zealand based Sharesight clients
  to pick one stock listed on the ASX to help us build a portfolio and fight it out
  with our friends over at Livewire. As of the [October quarterly update](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition--october-update/)
  the Livewire readers were out-performing Sharesight clients so we need everyone
  to participate so we can win in 2018!\n\n![featured 2018-stock-picking-competition

  How will the 2018 Sharesight Stock Picking Competition work?\n\nWe’ll send an email
  out to all Sharesight clients in December asking you to:\n\n### “Pick your #1 performing
  stock of 2018 for one of the following markets”\n\n- Australia (ASX)\n- New Zealand
  (NZX)\n- Canada (TSE or CNSX)\n- United Kingdom (LSE)\n- USA (NYSE or NASDAQ)\n\nWe’ll
  create a Sharesight portfolio and track its performance from January 1st through
  to December 31st 2018. \n\nYou’ll be able to follow the performance of the portfolio
  and your picks via the Sharesight blog, as well as with a [Sharesight public portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-sharesight-public-portfolios/)
  we’ll create to track the competition. \n\n## Who am I competing with?\n\nYou’ll
  be competing against every Sharesight client who submits their pick for the top-performing
  stock in 2018, as well as other Sharesight partners who will join the competition
  in 2018 (these partners will be revealed soon).\n\n## What’s in it for me?\n\nThe
  glory of being Sharesight’s top stock picker for 2018! Plus prizes to be announced
  in the new year.\n\n## When can I submit my pick?\n\nDo you think you already have
  the perfect stock pick for 2018? Keep it to yourself for now -- we’ll be sending
  you an email in the next few weeks to get your pick!\n\nGood luck and happy investing
  in 2018!\n\n\n### FURTHER READING \n\n- Blog -- [2017 stock picking competition](/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition/)\n-
