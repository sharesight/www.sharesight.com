:title: How QLD Uni students used Sharesight to help grow their portfolio by 55%
:url_slug: students-use-sharesight-to-run-investment-fund
:content: "Students from [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) (UQ)
  have been using Sharesight to help manage and run their Student Managed Investment
  Fund (SMIF). The students have benefited from the ability to actively see and track
  the portfolio and the underlying investments in the fund, and have managed to grow
  the fund’s value since its inception in 2018. To find out more about how Sharesight
  has been helping students learn about investing, keep reading. \n\n![QLD Uni students

  What is the SMIF?\n\nIn 2018, The University of Queensland (UQ) approved the allocation
  of $200,000 to the university’s [Student Managed Investment Fund](https://business.uq.edu.au/students/student-managed-investment-fund)
  (SMIF), which was initially invested on two dates in November and December of that
  year. Since semester 2, 2019, student teams have managed the fund for 6-month periods.
  \n\nThe SMIF was established to enable UQ Business School students to apply their
  academic knowledge and acquire practical skills by managing a portfolio of Australian
  equity securities using real money in real-time. Students gain exposure to the world
  of asset management by assuming the role of analysts and are responsible for the
  construction, monitoring and management of the fund.\n\nThe current value of the
  portfolio is approximately $310,000. That's an incredible profit increase of 55%
  in just three years, which has now been reinvested into the program. In the long
  run, the SMIF’s investment returns will be used to support student scholarships.\n\n##
  How Sharesight helps students track the SMIF\n\nSharesight is used to track the
  basis point returns each month for the fund’s monthly updates, as well as to check
  each investment within the portfolio to identify the largest movers within the month.
  Sharesight gives information on alpha returns based on the ASX200 index which the
  fund uses for its reports, and it allows the students to see the fund’s returns
  on a monetary and percentage basis, from inception, year on year, and month on month.\n\n\"Sharesight
  has been a great addition to the UQ SMIF,\" says Joshua Pettman, an incumbent student
  portfolio manager at The University of Queensland.  \n\n\"Prior to using Sharesight
  we managed the portfolio’s positions and performance using a large Excel spreadsheet
  and a Capital IQ Plugin. This required a lot of computer power and work to compile
  the monthly performance and ongoing tracking of the fund. \n\n\"Using Sharesight
  has allowed us to speed up the process significantly and get a more accurate view
  of the fund’s performance. We can now just add our purchases and sales to Sharesight
  and it automatically shows us the performance for the month and allows us to find
  the value of the fund at a certain date with ease. The automatic corporate actions
  are a big help as well, as this allows us to save time on calculating dividends
  and franking credits for our holdings.\"\n\n## Sharesight – empowering the next
  generation of investors\n\nAs part of our mission to empower all investors we’re
  excited by this story of the next generation embracing tools like Sharesight to
  help them be better investors and manage portfolios of all sizes. To track the ongoing
  progress of the SMIF, [click here](https://business.uq.edu.au/students/student-managed-investment-fund)
