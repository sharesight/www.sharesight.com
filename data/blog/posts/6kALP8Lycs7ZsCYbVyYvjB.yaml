  and should not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nOne of the main
  reasons we invest is to build wealth for retirement. But it’s hard to estimate how
  much money we’ll need to support our post-work life.\n\nThis can be a controversial
  subject, because different experts and lobby groups can provide very different numbers.
  However, there is one thing most people agree on: surviving on a pension or Social
  Security without other forms of savings is hard.\n\n![How much money do you need

  Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK, the maximum payment a single person can
  receive is low. In the US, which has a fiendishly complicated retirement system,
  the maximum payment is relatively high at US$36,132, although the average payment
  is only US$18,036, according to [AARP](https://www.aarp.org/), an association that
  represents older Americans.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Country</td>\n    <td>Maximum

  if you want a comfortable retirement, you’ll need to build wealth during your working
  years, and to know how much you’ll need by the time you retire, you’ll want to crunch
  the numbers now to give yourself a nest egg target to guide your investing decisions
  for the future.\n\n## Step 1: Estimate your spending\n\nTo calculate how much you
  might need to save for retirement, the first thing you need to do is estimate how
  much you expect to spend each year.\n\nMany people assume they’ll spend as much
  when they’re retired as they do now. However, when you retire, there’s a good chance
  your cost of living will fall naturally.\n\nYou probably won’t have to pay off a
  mortgage or support children. True, you’ll spend more on doctors, hospitals and
  pharmaceuticals, but much of that might be covered by health insurance or government
  subsidies.\n\nIt’s important to take stock of your likely expenses during retirement,
  and build a model using some reasonable assumptions about your expenses during retirement.
  Vanguard provides a helpful [retirement expenses worksheet online](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/retirement/tool/retirement-expense-worksheet)
  that you can work through, or you might prefer your own budgeting spreadsheet (or
  pencil and paper) to crunch these numbers to arrive at an estimated yearly figure
  for your expenses in retirement.\n\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia
  also releases [generic expenditure figures](https://www.superguide.com.au/boost-your-superannuation/how-much-cost-live-in-retirement)
  based on their own definition of what is a ‘comfortable’ and ‘modest’ retirement
  lifestyle is that can make a good starting point.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate your (median)
  life expectancy\n\nOnce you’ve estimated your likely yearly expenditure, you need
  to forecast how long you’ll likely spend in retirement.\n\nIn the five countries
  mentioned earlier, life expectancy is about 80 for men and 84 for women.\n\n<table>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <td>Country</td>\n    <td>Male life expectancy</td>\n    <td>Female
  life expectancy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Australia</td>\n    <td>81.6</td>\n
  \   <td>85.5</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Canada</td>\n    <td>80.6</td>\n    <td>84.4</td>\n
  \ </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>New Zealand</td>\n    <td>80.7</td>\n    <td>84.0</td>\n
  \ </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>UK</td>\n    <td>79.7</td>\n    <td>83.1</td>\n  </tr>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <td>USA</td>\n    <td>76.4</td>\n    <td>81.5</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<small>Source:
  [World Population Review](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/life-expectancy-by-country/)</small>\n\nHowever,
  these figures can be misleading, because they refer to the average life expectancy
  of a person at birth; the average life expectancy of someone who survives until
  adulthood is higher, and someone who survives until retirement, higher still.\n\nIf
  we look at [data from the Australian Government Actuary (AGA) on life expectancy
  of people who reach age 65](http://www.aga.gov.au/publications/life_table_2010-12/03-Part1.asp),
  the average (median) 65 year old male can actually expect to live to [88 years,](https://www.smh.com.au/money/super-and-retirement/life-expectancy-and-spending-in-retirement-20190925-p52uot.html)
  with women expected to live to 90 -- an increase of 6.2 and 4.5 years respectively
  over the earlier figures.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate your target nest egg\n\nOnce you’ve
  estimated how much you expect to spend each year in retirement, you are then in
  a good place to calculate the size of the nest egg you’ll need to achieve in order
  to put you in a good position to fund your target lifestyle.\n\nSay for example
  you were a single Australian woman who had a life expectancy of 90, who planned
  to retire at 65 and had calculated yearly expenses to fund her lifestyle at $50,000.\n\nWhile
  it’s perhaps an overly simplistic calculation, that gives a target of $1,250,000
  (25 years in retirement x $50,000 yearly expenditure).\n\n## Important caveats\n\nNow
  first and foremost, this target nest egg is only useful as a *starting point* to
  discuss your own circumstances (and you should always consult a financial adviser
  for individual advice).\n\nThere are two important considerations to contextualise
  the above target number:\n\n### Won’t my investments continue to earn returns into
  retirement?\n\nIf you’re an astute investor who benefits from markets that move
  in the right direction, your investments will hopefully continue to work for you
  well into your retirement. But that is never guaranteed, and many would consider
  a [defensive portfolio allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/is-it-time-to-consider-a-defensive-investment-strategy/)
  weighted towards *relatively* safer assets like cash and fixed interest securities
  (that earn lower returns) appropriate during this phase.\n\n### What if I live longer
  than the median life expectancy?\n\nThis is a *very important consideration*, if
  you’ve calculated and saved a nest egg to fund your lifestyle based on your median
  life expectancy, there’s a 50% chance you will live longer than this (and each year
  you live, your life expectancy increases further). This is known as [longevity risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_risk).\n\nTo
  mitigate this risk, some investors turn to products [such as annuities](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement/income-sources-in-retirement/income-from-super/annuities)
  that offer regular payments for either a set period, or set payments over your lifetime.\n\nSome
  may prefer to adopt the [\"dynamic-spending rule\"](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/articles/insights/research-commentary/retirement-and-superannuation/dynamic-approach.jsp)
  approach discussed by investment fund manager [Vanguard](https://www.vanguard.com/).
  With a dynamic spending rule approach, investors set a minimum and maximum percentage
  they are willing to draw down their portfolio each year, and should the portfolio
  perform poorly, adjust down their budget for spending that year to potentially overdraw
  the portfolio – leaving less for later years.\n\nThe key to succeeding with the
  dynamic-spending rule approach is having the full picture of your investment portfolio
  and checking on its performance regularly, that’s where a portfolio tracking tool
  like [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/uk/) is critical.\n\n## Set on the
