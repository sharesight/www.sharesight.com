:title: Sharesight’s beautiful Xero integration
:url_slug: sharesights-beautiful-xero-integration
:content: "A lot of [Sharesight](/) clients ask if we’re owned by or somehow part
  of [Xero](https://www.xero.com). We’re not. But the misunderstanding makes sense.
  We’re both disruptive cloud companies based in Wellington and spend a lot of time
  out on the road together. The fact that our integration is so seamless might be
  the real source of the confusion. In a nutshell, the [Sharesight + Xero connection](/xero/)
  means you can do proper investment accounting, automatically.\n\n![Xero Add-On](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2tcXk9vz6wKWSKAuiuQ8o8/ef31d4dcb3cd55b3da1d34cf7f105aec/Xero-logo.png?w=950)\n\n[We’re
  a “Five Star” Xero Add-On Partner](https://community.xero.com/business/discussion/2212560/),
  which means your Sharesight portfolios can be synchronised with Xero. Whether you’re
  using [Xero Cashbook](/xero/) or any sized Xero business plan, all of your investment
  data will flow through to Xero’s accounting app “automagically.” It’s super easy
  to connect the two. Just go to Xero Settings within Sharesight and connect by entering
  your Xero username and password.\n\n![Xero Cashbook integration](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3nPlIC16kMGqyW64E28GY4/a7dd14d6ab31472a3c91c251f2f5eacd/Xero-integraton.png?w=950)
  \n\nOnce the accounts are synced, just tell Xero if you’d like to use bank transactions
  or invoices. Now you’re ready to map your Sharesight investment transactions and
  income with your personalised chart of accounts in Xero. This means you can track
  your realised gains, losses, dividends reinvested (DRPs), interest income, franking
  credits, and much more. The point is, you can tailor your chart of accounts for
  each type of client and setup the corresponding Xero reports accordingly.\n\n![Sharesight’s
  Beautiful Xero Integration](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6Lf6AW2Qus4wqKwwo6mqmY/886ae8ee15aa897b31e6b282d1545ff6/dougs-merge.png?w=950)\n\nUsing
  [Xero Report Packs](https://digitalfirst.com/xero-report-packs-bring-free-financial-reporting-to-australian-partners/)
  takes this one step further. Report Packs allow for reusable, special purpose templates.
  These are especially handy for those with self managed super funds (SMSFs), professional
  traders, and even the buy and hold long term investor.\n\nFrom this point on when
  you (or your clients) make a trade or when you receive a dividend payout, this data
  will go from the broker to Sharesight to Xero in about two minutes. Sharesight will
  even show you when the data has been sent through successfully. Just watch the little
  Xero icon appear and go from grey to blue. It’s satisfying, trust us. \n\n![Sharesight’s
  Beautiful Xero Integration](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/50QW8JGziU2gyQ4k4MKiQ/5948d9bad0d5a1594b1366f8d0583914/dividend-xero-sync.png?w=950)\n\nIf
  you’re like a lot of our clients, a good chunk of your day is spent in front of
  Xero. After all, it’s the engine that underpins your business. Since our sync works
  even when you’re not logged into Sharesight, you can still see investment activities
  as they flow through. Have a client who invested in the new OzForex float? Clients
  that stand to benefit from Westpac’s special dividend? How about a client who turned
  a quick profit on the Twitter IPO? No problem, we’ve got you covered. We’re not
  talking about a one line, cryptically coded entry either. Sharesight pushes through
  all of the execution details. And if you want to investigate a bit more, we’ve added
  a handy link within each Xero transaction record.\n\n![Xero Cashbook](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4cyy86u6QgqGC0aMKMI2uO/e78f9b0bc467bc0c4d3813c649a5b76c/Xero.png?w=950)\n\nBefore
  the Sharesight and Xero hook-up, investors (and especially accountants) had to play
  catch up at tax time. Each time an accurate snapshot of capital gains or dividend
  income was needed, they were forced to wind back the clock and recreate client portfolios.
  No more. Since Sharesight records trades, corporate actions, and dividends as they
  happen over the course of a tax year, generating a performance report, capital gains
  tax report, cash summary, or profit & loss statement is just a couple of clicks
  away. \n\nSharesight and Xero gives time back to accountants, financial advisers,
  and investors. This is time freed up from rote, admin tasks like manually entering
  portfolio data or tracking down a dividend payment. These precious billable hours
  can now be applied to forward-looking, discussions like tax planning, estate planning,
  anything to reassure clients you’re thinking about them strategically.\n\n### FURTHER
