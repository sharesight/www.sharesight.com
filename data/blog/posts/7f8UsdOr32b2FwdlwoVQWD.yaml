  Stockfox’s share market advice app. By connecting Sharesight and Stockfox, investors
  can leverage the investment advice and stock analysis capabilities of Stockfox with
  Sharesight’s performance tracking and tax reporting tools – creating the ultimate
  solution for self-directed investors. To learn more about Stockfox and how investors

  What is Stockfox?\n\nStockfox is a virtual share market advice app that provides
  tips and analysis for the New Zealand, Australian and major United States (NYSE
  and NASDAQ) share markets. Users receive clear, actionable tips as notifications
  on their preferred digital device. The tips and research are generated by leading
  share market analyst and commentator David McEwen and his team of analysts. The
  tips are based on the proven stock assessment criteria David has developed and refined
  over the past 25 years. \n\nStockfox is designed to make professional advice accessible
  to the everyday investor, and to reduce the confusion and anxiety people often feel
  when trying to decide what shares to buy and when to sell. \n\n![Stockfox](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/431S23z8M2hGyyJxnNAED/634feb0470e9cfb29ea5b39c4032c0c8/Stockfox.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Why has Stockfox connected to Sharesight?\n\nFor Stockfox, integrating with Sharesight
  is all about turning Stockfox into a one-stop shop for share market advice, analysis
  and portfolio monitoring. \n\n\"We all know that the number of people investing
  in the share market has increased exponentially recently, but not many of these
  investors have access to credible financial advice and the ability to accurately
  monitor their portfolios’ performance,\" says Stockfox founder and lead analyst
  David McEwen.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity to give keen investors who diligently
  keep track of their investments reliable and professional advice. They will feel
  more confident with their investing decisions and ultimately make the most of their
  investing experience.\"\n\nStockfox wants to elevate the investing experience for
  those who want more in-depth knowledge, and connecting with Sharesight will allow
  for this. With the advice and portfolio tracking features all in one app, it’ll
  be easy for investors to get the most out of their time trading and tracking their
  shares.\n\n## Why investors should connect Sharesight and Stockfox\n\nConnecting
  Sharesight and Stockfox creates a holistic digital solution for self-directed investors
  trading in Australian, New Zealand and US shares. Investors will benefit from the
  ability to track the performance (and tax implications) of the Stockfox tips they
  act on, as well as the rest of the holdings in their portfolio, alongside the advice
  and analysis they receive in the Stockfox app. \n\n\"Sharesight and Stockfox are
  two very different, yet complementary platforms,\" says Joe Salvati, Partnerships
  Director at Sharesight. \n\n\"Sharesight is all about providing independent portfolio
  tracking, performance and tax reporting for investors. What we don’t do is provide
  financial advice, which is where Stockfox comes in. So the integration is perfect
  for investors looking for a way to help them make better investment decisions while
  eliminating the need for complex spreadsheets and tedious portfolio admin.\"\n\n###
