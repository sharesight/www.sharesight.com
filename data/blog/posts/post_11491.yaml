  **Tip #10 &mdash; How well your share portfolio is performing?**

  It’s a bizarre fact of life that we all invest in the share market to maximise our returns but few of us have any real idea how well our individual shareholdings are performing, let alone our total portfolio. That’s because the calculations are pretty daunting. Figures need to include price changes as well as dividends and allow for currency movements on any foreign shares. To be useful the figures also need to be available over any date range and that means you need an enormous amount of data at your fingertips even for a small portfolio. Fortunately there are [online share tracking systems](/) that will give you the true story on your portfolio.
