  What is the Shenzhen Stock Exchange?\n\nThe [Shenzhen Stock Exchange](http://www.szse.cn/English/)
  is the second largest stock exchange in mainland China by market cap, behind the
  Shanghai Stock Exchange. But it has a larger [monthly trading volume at just over
  US$700 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_exchanges).\n\nSupport
  for the Shenzhen Stock exchange is part of Sharesight’s mission to be your investor
  passport to a world of investments. \n\n## How to track the Shenzhen Stock Exchange
  (SHE) with Sharesight\n\n1. Sign-up for a FREE [Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
