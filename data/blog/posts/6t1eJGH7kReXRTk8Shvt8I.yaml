:content: "Welcome to the July 2021 edition of Sharesight’s monthly USA trading snapshot,
  where we look at Sharesight users’ top 20 trades in US stocks on the Nasdaq, NYSE
  and [NYSE American market](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/)
  (AMEX) over the month. \n\nIn this snapshot, buy trades were narrowly led by Alibaba
  (NYSE: BABA), which was part of a Chinese stock selloff in the broader market caused
  by growing regulation fears. At the same time, buy and sell trades were also led
  by US tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), both of which posted
  strong financial results this month. \n\n## Top 20 US stock trades July 2021\n\n![Top
