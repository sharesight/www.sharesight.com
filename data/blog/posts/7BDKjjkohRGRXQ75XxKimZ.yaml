:title: See how time impacts your portfolio with the Multi-Period Report
:url_slug: multi-period-report
:content: "As part of Sharesight’s dedication to building out the most comprehensive
  digital reporting suite for investors, we have launched our new [Multi-Period Report](https://help.sharesight.com/multi-period-report/),
  which allows investors to compare their portfolio returns over a choice of up to
  five distinct or cumulative periods. Available for Sharesight users on [Expert](https://www.sharesight.com/au/pricing/)
  and [Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/au/pro/) plans, the Multi-Period Report is
  an easy way to see the impact of a portfolio rebalance, evaluate performance before
  and after a market correction or even compare a portfolio’s returns against fund
  manager performance periods. To learn more about how the Multi-Period Report gives
  investors the information they need to make better decisions, keep reading.\n\n![Multi-Period
  Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/55MqSiNL8bt1n2YyVEBtow/61dd780bb265bfe1d924909fa4eb05b5/Multi-Period_Report.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Clearly see the impact of time on portfolio performance\n\nThe Multi-Period Report
  presents a portfolio’s returns over up to five distinct or cumulative periods, with
  the option to group the results by **market**, **currency**, **sector**, **industry**,
  **investment type**, **country** or a **[custom grouping](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)**.
  Not limited to **total return values**, you can also view the portfolio’s **capital
  gains**, **payout gains** and **currency gains** in percentage or monetary values.
  This gives investors the flexibility they need to evaluate their performance against
  any number of investing strategies or market events.\n\n### Assess investment decisions
  against market events\n\nComparing distinct or custom periods allows you to clearly
  assess investment decisions against events such as market corrections, individual
  asset corrections or portfolio rebalancing. This can be achieved simply by choosing
  the relevant dates pre- and post-event and grouping the results by an appropriate
  classification such as market, sector or industry, for example.\n\n### Put performance
  volatility in context\n\nUsing the Multi-Period Report to compare cumulative periods
  makes it easy to understand performance volatility within a broader context. For
  example, if a portfolio has performed well in previous quarters but underperformed
  in the latest quarter, this suggests that the investor may need to re-evaluate their
  investing strategy or determine whether any of their investments have been affected
  by a market correction or other similar event. \n\nComparing cumulative periods
  can also provide an at-a-glance view of a portfolio’s rolling returns across different
  time horizons, making it possible to benchmark the portfolio against ETF or fund
  performance periods. This could be useful for investors investing over a long time
  horizon or planning for retirement, for example.\n\n### Track the long-term performance
  of a dividend portfolio\n\nThe Multi-Period Report is a useful tool for dividend
  investors, as it allows you to effortlessly evaluate the performance of dividend
  stocks over the long-term. For example, a dividend investor might use the report
  to compare dividend payouts in their portfolio over several cumulative financial
  years. With all of the relevant performance information at a glance, investors can
  clearly identify underperforming dividend stocks and use this information to rebalance
  their portfolio as needed. \n\n### Customise the report to your investing strategy\n\nCategorising
  the Multi-Period Report by [Custom Groups](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  can give you greater insight into a portfolio’s performance based on the metrics
  of your choice. The screenshot below, for example, shows a portfolio divided into
  tech stocks, REITs, ETFs and cryptocurrency. In this specific case, the Multi-Period
  Report has been used to show the impact of a Q1 correction in Australian and US
  tech stocks on the overall portfolio.\n\n![Multi-Period Report Example](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6N8htR82A41URiT941Yr7c/b04461076863187b59a30e1a8522f523/Multi-Period_Report_Example.jpg?w=950)\n\n<small>
  The Multi-Period Report applied to a global portfolio, viewing cumulative quarters
  filtered by Custom Groups. This can be a useful way to view the impact of stock
  market trends or identify underperforming stocks that need to be reviewed. </small>\n\n##
  Running the Multi-Period Report\n\nRunning the Multi-Period Report is simple, with
  an intuitive three-step setup process that allows you to choose from a range of
  powerful parameters designed for the diverse needs of investors. Once you have chosen
  your parameters, the report will display an easy-to-read chart followed by more
  in-depth information on the portfolio’s individual holdings.\n\nRead our [help page](https://help.sharesight.com/multi-period-report/)
