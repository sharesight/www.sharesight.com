:content: |-
  Our new [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/) feature is now available to [Expert](/pricing/) plan and [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) partners.

  ![Diversity Report 2011 - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7pDY6pbKiQOCooWegKgWIU/3a671788872b9741386cc70f8829f5c8/featured_diversity-2011.png?w=950)

  We know that for many of our customers being adequately diversified is an important part of their investment strategy. To help you do this we have developed a portfolio diversity report that provides a detailed breakdown of your investments by [industry classification](/blog/updated-industry-classification-data/), investment type (shares, options, funds etc), market, and country, along with a graphical view in the form of a pie chart.

  Our Australian customers will find this report invaluable for meeting their SMSF reporting requirements.

  As with all reports, you can run the Diversity report based on any date and export all of the data into an Excel spreadsheet.
