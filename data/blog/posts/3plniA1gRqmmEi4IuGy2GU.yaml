:title: Five paths to investment diversification
:content: "[Diversification](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/) is one
  of the most critical considerations when building an investment portfolio. Ensuring
  that you are adequately diversified helps you ride out the ups and downs of financial
  markets by spreading your money across different investments.\n\nThis lowers the
  volatility of your overall portfolio and manages your risk, meaning you are less
  exposed to a single event. If one asset type, sector, industry or company you've
  invested in isn't performing well, you won't lose all your money.\n\nWhile the importance
  of diversification is common knowledge, the [2017 ASX investor study](https://www.asx.com.au/education/2017-asx-investor-study.htm)
  tells us that only ‘46% of Australian investors claim to hold a diversified portfolio,
  holding on average 2.7 asset classes each (shares, property and/or cash typically).’
  This raises the obvious question as to how diversified the remaining 54% of investors
  actually are.\n\n## Diversification seeks to lower correlation\n\nUnderlying diversification
  is the statistical concept of correlation. Correlation is a measure of how two variables,
  investments in this case, move in relation to one another and when. When they move
  in the same direction at the same time, they are considered to be highly correlated
  (coefficient of +1). When one moves up as another goes down, they are considered
  to be negatively correlated (coefficient of -1). A **value** of 0 indicates that
  there is no association between the two variables.\n\n![investment diversification](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/22j8Iw5HPaeog0OSiSuW4a/173f3a747cfb028575169ce9bf6b4acc/investment_diversification.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Types of diversification\n\nHere are five common types of diversification to consider
  in order to achieve adequate protection from any single risk.\n\n### 1. Diversification
  across asset classes\n\nThere is a high degree of correlation within asset classes.
  This correlation can increase returns when times are good, but it also increases
  the risk that your investment portfolio could suffer a dramatic fall in value in
  the bad times.\n\nIt's critical, therefore, to consider your asset allocation strategy,
  as this has a significant impact on both returns and volatility. It is also important
  to remember that correlation can change over time due to moving asset class cycles
  or macro-economic factors. As with all investment strategies, you will get the best
  results when you are continually monitoring asset allocations and looking out for
  changes in correlations.\n\n### 2. Diversification within an asset class\n\nYou
  might want a particular exposure to equities or property, but betting on a single
  company or investment manager increases the risk of losing a significant amount
  of the value of your portfolio if that single investment were to drop in value.\n\nAlternatively,
  diversifying across a range of investments or managers within that asset class can
  minimise the risk of a loss due to manager or company specific factors. This can
  be achieved via index [tracking Exchange Traded Funds](/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/),
  for example, or holding multiple companies or using a variety of investment managers.\n\n###
  3. Diversification across industries\n\nThe ASX200 is dominated by finance and mining
  companies. It is likely that within your diversified portfolio you will have investments
  within these industries. If either of them is to be hit by headwinds, even a reasonably
  diversified equity portfolio will feel the pain.\n\nTo minimise risk, ensure that
  your investment portfolio includes an adequate spread across industries. Be careful
  to critically assess and select investments in a range of industries that aren't
  all closely correlated.\n\n### 4. Diversification across geographies\n\nAccording
  to the [ASX 2017 investor study](https://www.asx.com.au/education/2017-asx-investor-study.htm),
  75% of Australian share investors hold Australian shares exclusively. However, Australian
  shares make up less than 2% of global equities overall. Should the Australian markets
  or the Australian economy tumble, not only will it hurt your portfolio, but, depending
  on the severity of the downfall, it may also impact your employment.\n\nOvercoming
  ‘home bias’ is essential for building a balanced portfolio. Thankfully, there is
  an increasing array of global focused ETFs available on the ASX to help investors
  diversify geographically. Don't risk your portfolio by favouring home based investments.\n\n###
  5. Diversification through time\n\nThe point in time in which you purchase any investment
  determines the price you pay. A single purchase at a point in time means a high
  risk of buying at a ‘high’ price.\n\n[Dollar cost averaging](/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/)
  is the act of regularly purchasing a set dollar amount of an investment. This tactic
  allows you to diversify through market and price fluctuations, buying more units
  of an investment when prices are lower, and fewer when they are higher.\n\n## Diversification
  is important in volatile times\n\nDiversification is important. Managing and [tracking
  diversification](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/) is challenging and
  time-consuming, especially if you’re [tracking it all manually in a spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/).
  Thankfully, as technology has improved, so too have the solutions available to track
  and manage your portfolio. Options like [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/)
