:title: 5 ways Sharesight helps Australian investors at tax time
:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not
  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant to obtain
  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nSharesight’s valuable tax reports (built
  according to ATO rules) save Australian investors both time and money at tax time.
  Whether you file your taxes yourself, or via an accountant, read on to learn how
  Sharesight’s Australian-specific tax features not only help you complete your tax
  return, but also save you time and money.\n\n### Here are the 5 ways Sharesight
  helps Australian investors at tax time:\n\n1. [Australian tax settings](#australian-tax-settings)\n2.
  [Australian Capital Gains Tax Report](#australian-capital-gains-tax-report)\n3.
  [Unrealised CGT Report](#unrealised-CGT-report)\n4. [Taxable Income Report](#taxable-income-report)\n5.
  [Portfolio sharing](#portfolio-sharing)\n\n## Important tax deadlines\n\n* **30

  tax return for the 2019-2020 financial year must be filed by 15 May 2021 when filing
  via a tax agent. Note that this deadline moves forward to 31 March if you had tax
  payable of $20,000 or more in the previous financial year and are filing via a tax
  agent. If you have one or more unlodged tax returns from earlier years, you must
  file your returns (this year’s return and the outstanding earlier returns) by 31
  October.\n\n![Featured - 5 ways Sharesight helps Australian investors at tax time](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/hPaZLHSwx2eU2w0suCya4/8cb4f8c38b932c179f0c16b880b308f8/featured_5-ways-Sharesight-helps-Australian-investors-at-tax-time.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Australian tax features within Sharesight\n\nWith all your investment tax related
  data in one place, and dividends automatically captured, Sharesight makes tax-time
  a breeze. This is especially true for Australian investors, as 4 of the following
  5 tax features were built specifically with them in mind:\n\n### #1 – Australian
  tax settings\n\nInvestors with a Sharesight portfolio tax residency set to \"Australia\"
  have a choice of the following portfolio tax settings which conform to Australian
  Taxation Office (ATO) tax entities:\n\n* **Individuals / Trust** -- CGT discount
  of 50 %\n\n* **Self Managed Super Fund** -- CGT discount of 33⅓ %\n\n* **Company
  CGT** -- discount of nil\n\nFor more information, check out our help page: *[Tax
  Residency of a Portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/)*.\n\n###
  #2 – Australian Capital Gains Tax Report\n\nThe [Australian Capital Gains Tax Report](/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  calculates capital gains made on shares as per the [Australian Tax Office rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/).
  It allows you to specify different sale allocation methods across the entire portfolio
  and individual holdings, including:\n\n* **First In, First Out (FIFO)** – Sharesight
  assumes that you sell your longest held shares first.\n\n* **Last In, First Out
  (LIFO)** – Sharesight assumes that you sell your most recently purchased shares
  first.\n\n* **Minimise Gain** – Sharesight assumes that you sell shares with the
  highest purchase price first.\n\n* **Maximise Gain** – Sharesight assumes that you
  sell shares with the lowest purchase price first.\n\n* **Minimise CGT** – Sharesight
  assumes that you sell shares that will result in the lowest capital gains tax first.
  This method is more sophisticated than the ‘Minimise capital gain’ method because
  it takes into account the Australian CGT discounting rules.\n\n![CGT Report - AU
  2020 : Sale Allocation Methods](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7JNbwa7sbqfWjFFkpBAG7u/c1ab12fb71b18b04906c7ddebff91050/cgt-report-au-2020-sale-allocation-methods_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nYou
  may run the Capital Gains Tax Report over any period in order to see:\n\n* The CGT
  position for all your holdings sold within the period.\n\n* Your CGT gains broken-up
  into short and long term, as well as your losses.\n\n* A summary of the short and
  long term gains and losses, as well as any capital gain or claimable loss.\n\n![Capital

  more information, check out our help page: *[Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/)*\n\n###
  #3 – Unrealised CGT Report\n\nIf you’ve incurred some losses this year, the Unrealised
  CGT Report helps you decide whether a [tax loss selling](/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  strategy can help you offset your gains before the end of the tax year.\n\nThe Unrealised
  CGT Report:\n\n* Displays the CGT position for all your holdings which are not yet
  sold.\n\n* Breaks-up the CGT gains into short and long term, and shows your losses
  as well.\n\n* Allows you to specify the sale allocation method at the overall portfolio
  and individual holding level to determine your optimum position.\n\n* Models the
  taxable income that would arise if the shares were sold on the report date\n\n![Tax

  more information, check out our help page: *[Unrealised Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/unrealised_cgt_report/)*\n\n###
  #4 – Taxable Income Report\n\nThe [Taxable Income Report](/blog/improved-taxable-income-report-for-australian-investors/)
  is also very useful at tax time as it breaks down all dividends over any time period,
  organised by local/overseas income and separates out withholding tax and imputation
  credits from the net dividend.\n\n![Taxable Income Report - 2021](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/50wNur2cogQG7amYM0RkUq/dd49aa358f9940de2bf1d4733887bd03/Taxable_Income_Report_-_2021.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  report also provides field references to the relevant sections on the Australian
  Income Tax Return for Individuals and Income Tax Return for Individuals (supplementary
  section), as well as the totals required for the Income Tax Return based on non-trust
  and trust income. This will go a long way in helping investors to file their 2020-2021
  returns.\n\nFor more information, check out our help page: *[Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/taxable_income/)*\n\n###
  #5 – Portfolio sharing\n\nAnother essential tax-time feature is the ability to [share
  your portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/).
  Rather than printing-out and forwarding your Sharesight tax reports, you can securely
  share portfolio access directly with your accountant and/or financial advisor. With
  all your portfolio data in one place, they’ll have everything they need to prepare
  your tax documents. Available on all Sharesight plans, portfolio sharing ensures
  everyone’s on the same page and focusing on what really matters -- not just at tax-time
  but throughout the year.\n\nFor more information, check out our help page: *[Sharing
  access of your portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/)*\n\n###
