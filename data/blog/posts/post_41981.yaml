:title: Global stock markets available on Sharesight
:url_slug: global-stock-markets
:content: "Today we're pleased to announce that more global stock markets are available
  on [Sharesight](/)! We've made a significant investment in our data platform (and
  your Sharesight account) for two reasons:\n\n- To satisfy the growing international
  appetite of investors in our original markets\n- To pave the way for our imminent
  launch in overseas markets\n\nSharesight now provides **historical & daily** prices,
  dividends, and corporate actions on **approximately 200 overseas markets**. \n\n![Laptop

  kick things off, we've added some of the most popular new markets to your Sharesight
  account. Just login and add a new holding. In the Market dropdown menu you'll see
  options for the Euronext, the three [Canadian stock markets](/blog/announcing-sharesight-canada/),
  and the Hong Kong stock exchange.\n\n![Sharesight International Markets](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4woZVLamhOmYMqcuwWW66W/6441b7f8cc7ca5626e1bf2954a4f61e1/screenshot_intl-markets.png?w=950)\n\nWe're
  on standby and have more markets ready to be deployed - and we'll do so based on
  client demand. If you'd like to access an exchange, please navigate to the Help
  tab within Sharesight to get in touch or post on our [customer forum](https://community.sharesight.com).\n\nFinally,
  Sharesight will convert price and dividend data back to your portfolio's local currency
  so no need to worry about exchange rates.\n\n### Don't Forget Your Passport\n\nBack
  to our first point above, [home country bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_home_bias_puzzle)
  has plagued retail investors for years, especially in countries with deep capital
  markets like the US and Australia. But that's beginning to change as investors demand
  exposure to global sharemarkets - and we're seeing demand for a multitude of global
  stock markets. Most notably northern Asia and Europe, alongside [Canada](/blog/announcing-sharesight-canada/).\n\nStudies
  show that American investors are hopelessly skewed towards their own backyard, but
  they're lucky - many American companies derive the bulk of their revenues from overseas,
  and most large international firms are listed on US domestic markets anyway, thereby
  giving the American investor a fairly diversified portfolio.\n\nNow, if you're an
  Aussie investor, chances are you're well aware of your (over?) exposure to banks
  and resources. But to date the average retail investor hasn't had a choice short
  of ridiculous $100 overseas trading fees. The huge growth in ETF inflows is partly
  a result of investors seeking overseas exposure. Even it if they're passive, ETFs
  are cheap are exchange traded. \n\nFortunately, overseas brokers and product providers
  are flooding Australia - and we're definitely seeing the effects at Sharesight.\n\nToday,
  nearly 20% of our Australian-based portfolios contain overseas shares and a full
  75% of Kiwi investors own overseas companies (a big chunk are ASX companies to be
  sure, with BHP being the 10th most popular holding by New Zealand-based investors).\n\nFor
  example, you can now trade international shares on CMC Markets or Saxo Capital Markets
  for as little as 2 cents per share.\n\nTech companies gravitate towards old-school
  industries with fat margins. Just as fintech companies are disrupting the payments
  industry, we expect foreign online brokers to do the same for international brokerage.
  Bring it on!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Blog -- [More global markets available: Singapore,
