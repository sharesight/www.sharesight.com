  As you may have heard by now, Google *has* killed-off their Google Finance portfolio tracker. So if you managed to save/download a copy of your Google Finance portfolio data, you can easily import your existing Google Finance portfolio directly into [Sharesight](/).

  ###### Sharesight is an award-winning portfolio tracker that DIY investors around the world rely on for performance, dividend, and tax reporting. It’s really much more than a Google Finance alternative – for a side-by-side comparison, check out the *[4 ways Sharesight is better than Google Finance](/blog/4-ways-sharesight-is-better-than-google-finance/)*.

  ## Importing your Google Finance portfolio into Sharesight is easy.

  Essentially all you need to do is:

  1. Download your portfolio from Google Finance (as an OFX file)
  2. Upload it to Sharesight

  Don’t worry -- you’ll be given the chance to review and edit your trade data. But once you’ve made any necessary adjustments, your Sharesight portfolio will be populated with your Google Finance portfolio. This will allow you to **view your portfolio performance across various date ranges** (something you can’t do with Google Finance):

  Sharesight will even auto-populate your actual dividends (unlike Google Finance, [who assume you only own 1 share’s worth](/blog/4-ways-sharesight-is-better-than-google-finance/)):
