:title: Congratulations to Doug and Scott, Sharesight CEO & CTO
:url_slug: sharesight-ceo-cto
:content: |-
  I’m delighted to announce that Doug Morris has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of [Sharesight](/). Since joining Sharesight in April 2013, Doug has done an excellent job of growing the Sydney team, forming valuable strategic partnerships, and overseeing the strong growth that we’ve achieved over the past year.

  Sharesight co-founder Scott Ryburn will become our Chief Technical Officer (CTO) and continue to manage our development team and the Wellington office. Scott and his team have developed a unique, sophisticated product for Doug and the sales and marketing teams to take to the world.

  Sharesight has many exciting product and partner announcements coming this year, and I’m confident that we’re in good hands with Doug and Scott’s leadership. Congratulations again!
