  Great news for Canadian investors! Today we’re pleased to formally announce new tax settings for [Sharesight](/) portfolios, just in time for the Canadian tax season. As a reminder, April 30 is the deadline to file your 2017 taxes (if you’re self-employed, it’s June 15).

  ## New tax settings for Canadian Sharesight portfolios

  Investors with a Sharesight portfolio tax residency set to “Canada” now have a choice of the following tax settings which conform to [Canadian Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax.html) (CRA) tax reporting rules:

  - **Non-registered** -- standard tax rules apply (default)
  - **Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)** -- Non-resident withholding tax does not apply for US stocks
  - **Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)** -- Non-resident withholding tax does not apply for US stocks
