:content: "Welcome to the November 2021 edition of Sharesight’s monthly USA trading
  snapshot, where we look at Sharesight users’ top 20 trades in US stocks on the Nasdaq,
  NYSE and [NYSE American market](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/)
  (AMEX) over the month. \n\nIn this snapshot, buy and sell trades were strongly led
  by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which has seen its share price fluctuate throughout November
  due to CEO Elon Musk’s sale of US$5.5b-worth of shares. Trades were followed by
  Meta (NASDAQ: FB), formerly known as Facebook, which rebranded at the end of October.
  It was a varied month overall, with the top trades spanning the tech, finance, entertainment
  and communications industries. \n\n## Top 20 US stock trades November 2021\n\n![Top
