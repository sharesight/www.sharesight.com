  May 2020 edition of the Sharesight20 monthly trading snapshot, where we look at
  the top 20 trades on both the ASX and NZX made by Sharesight users during the month.
  In May we saw a return to growth stocks and index based ETFs as interest in bear
  themed ETFs fell away.\n\nHere’s May’s top ASX and NZX trades.\n\n## Sharesight20

  May’s Sharesight20ASX snapshot the crown for the most traded stock again went to
  S&P ASX 300 index tracking ETF Vanguard Australian Shares (ASX: VAS) with investor
  confidence continuing to rebound. Interest in the two bear themed ETFs we first
  saw in March (ASX: BBOZ) & (ASX: BBUS) continued to fall away, with only the BetaShares
