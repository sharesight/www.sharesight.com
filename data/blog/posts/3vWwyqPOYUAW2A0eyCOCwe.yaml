  The three most annoying things found on the internet are: pop-up ads, videos that play automatically (with sound!), and date selection widgets found on airline and travel booking sites (and until now, [Sharesight](/)).

  Date range selectors have been the bane of website designers, UX specialists, and internet consumers for years. Nobody is foolish enough to build their own from scratch (think: leap year), which means that everyone uses the same off-the-shelf plug-ins. From what we can tell, they come from the same dusty corner of the internet responsible for those lengthy country dropdown menus.

  Often the most frustrating part of booking a flight online or searching for a hotel on TripAdvisor is fiddling with the bloody date selectors. To make matters worse, starting a fresh search usually means you need to reset the dates. Experienced web consumers will notice that even after a fancy website overhaul, the date pickers are often an afterthought.

  We put a lot of thought and effort into making the Sharesight interface intuitive, which is why we’re happy to announce the release of a much improved date range selection feature! This is not false enthusiasm – as investors, we’re genuinely happy about this.

  Sharesight puts so much history at your fingertips, it would be a shame if you weren’t making the most of it.

  First, the new date selector is bigger and easier to read:

  ![date range selector 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3noh3DBCxisacag8IuOEeY/c61f6f9f6e867a19ed30a854681c293e/date-selector.png?w=950)

  But the best part is our pre-defined date ranges, which include handy settings for "Since Inception" and "Last Financial Year":

  ![date range selector 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/36ZIAkN7kcGeaEsQEqwa2k/1d90327babac70d66d9ceefd26983203/date-selector-2.png?w=950)

  And finally, if you do want to define a custom range, our start and end calendars are large enough to actually use:

  We hope this helps shave even more time of your portfolio admin!
