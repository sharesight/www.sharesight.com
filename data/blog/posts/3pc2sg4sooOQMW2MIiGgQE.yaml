:title: 5 ways to get the portfolio insights you need
:content: |-
  **How has your portfolio performed so far this year?** Is it doing well or poorly because of the individual stocks you picked, or is it down to your asset allocation? Do you even know? The following [Sharesight](/) features will help you easily compare and contrast the winners and losers in your portfolio -- so you can understand what happened, and make informed decisions going forward.

  ![sharesight - diversity hands](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/xRd4ViI5zisCciYIsOkIS/d32abb32502549466dafb62e5b341945/featured_sharesight-diversity-hands.jpg?w=950)

  ## 1 -- Benchmarking
  How did your portfolio perform compared to the overall market this year? Find out with Sharesight’s [Benchmarking](/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/) feature, which lets you benchmark your entire portfolio (or an individual holding) against any stock, ETF, or fund. In this example, we can see that this particular portfolio performed extremely well compared to Vanguard’s Diversified High Growth Index ETF (ASX: VDBA):

  ## 2 -- Custom Groups
  Leveraging Sharesight’s [Custom Groups](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/) feature is a great way to organise your portfolio according to your preferred [asset allocation](/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/) methodology. Personally, I find it to be a great way to organise my holdings which are domiciled in Australia, Canada and the US, but actually track Australian, Canadian, global, and emerging markets:

  ## 3 -- Diversity Report
  Does your investment portfolio match [your appetite for risk](/blog/does-your-investment-portfolio-match-your-appetite-for-risk/)? Sharesight’s [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/) provides a visual breakdown of your portfolio by various default groupings such as Market, Sector, Investment Type, Country, as well as any Custom Groups you’ve set up:

  ![screenshot - sharesight - diversity report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4XAY9nBDTa2ikIKeUGqiu0/d25862746122f85336de11e4355984fd/screenshot_info_diversity-report.png?w=950)

  ## 4 -- Contribution Analysis Report
  Sharesight’s [Contribution Analysis Report](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/) takes asset allocation a step further by visually showing you the drivers behind your portfolio performance. Again, you can view this report by default groupings such as Market, Sector, Investment Type, Country, as well as any Custom Groups you’ve set up. In this example, we can see that Consumer Services (and more specifically Retail Food Group) were the major source of losses, and Health Technology provided the biggest gains:

  ## 5 -- Consolidated Views
  If you want to see the overall performance of multiple portfolios -- perhaps across your SMSF and personal portfolios, or your portfolio along with those of your spouse and children -- you can combine them using [Consolidated Views](/blog/new-functionality-for-consolidated-views/). This allows you to review the Portfolio Overview, Performance Report, Contribution Analysis Report, and Diversity Report of the combined portfolios, and also allows you to group the data by the default groupings, your Custom Groups, or by the individual portfolios that make up the Consolidated View:

  ## Want more insights?
  - **[Share your portfolio](/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/)** -- Another way to gain insights into your portfolio is by securely sharing your portfolio with your accountant and/or financial advisor. With all your portfolio data in one place, they’ll have everything they need to provide additional insights to you -- not just at tax-time but throughout the year.

  - **[Enable email alerts](/blog/3-sharesight-email-alerts-you-should-enable-today/)** -- Stay on top of any changes to your portfolio by subscribing to weekly portfolio summaries, as well as price and company alerts.

  ## Save by claiming your Sharesight subscription
