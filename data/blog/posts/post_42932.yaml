:title: Merge custom holdings to listed securities
:url_slug: merge-custom-holdings-to-listed-securities
:content: "Many clients make use of our [Custom Holding](https://help.sharesight.com/unquoted-instruments/)
  feature, sometimes referred to as the unlisted or other holdings feature. \n\nThis
  is a handy way to create and track unlisted securities, such as property, fixed
  interest, and (until recently) overseas stock markets that [Sharesight](/) didn't
  cover.\n\nSince we released coverage of more than [200 global markets](/blog/global-stock-markets/)
  last month, clients have been asking about a way to merge their manually-maintain
  custom holdings into the new and official, listed version of the investment.\n\nSo
  we went ahead and built a handy feature to facilitate this. \n\nSimply go into the
  holding page of one of the custom securities that you've been manually maintaining
  and go to the Holding Settings menu, which is down at the bottom, right-hand corner
  of the page.\n\n![Holding Settings](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5QasqzTqUwAS4euQAkCsEa/2d333a42433675114ac1f5b341fcb97e/screenshot_holding-settings.png?w=950)\n\nClick
  the link to \"Move to a Listed Instrument\" and on the pop-up screen select the
  market (which corresponds to the country you originally selected when you created
  the custom security). Then search for the company by name or code. Click Save and
  voila!\n\n![Merge custom holdings - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3DeIFvUtXqemgWwsmUsOyY/ba50e67eb037fa0044978ac3f5079b1b/featured_moved-to-listed-instrument.png?w=950)\n\nYour
  old, previously manually maintained investment has now been merged into the real
  holding. Going forward all prices, dividends, and corporate actions will be handled
  automatically.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Help -- [Merging a custom investment to
