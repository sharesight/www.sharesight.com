  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nPeriods of increased market volatility
  are an inevitable part of investing and, if this was ever in doubt, 2020 has emphatically
  driven this point home. The significant increases in market volatility driven by
  US-China trade tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic show little sign of abating in
  the short term and are something investors need to factor into their plans for 2021
  and beyond.\n\nA good starting point is to accept [volatility as a normal and necessary
  part of investing](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/SAI-market-volatility.pdf).
  Ultimately, elevated levels of market volatility can be challenging for investors
  but with this comes opportunity to both minimise risks and maximise opportunities.
  Here are three approaches investors use when taking a disciplined approach to volatility:\n\n![Investor
  Market Volatility](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6mxChuNtFvX7cbYxBQ4riv/04a710b87066af5ff1151e541a7b1ed3/Investor_Market_Volatility.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Diversification\n\n[Portfolio diversification](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/importance-diversification/)
  is the most common approach to managing investment risks related to volatility.
  Diversification aims to reduce the risk of damaging losses from the performance
  of a single company, sector or asset class over the long term while delivering at
  least some exposure to better performing assets or markets. Markets are also notorious
  for overreacting to events and with an open mindset and a longer-term investment
  perspective that accepts short-term volatility, investors can begin to take a more
  dispassionate view. \n\nFor investors, this means carefully considering asset allocation
  as part of the portfolio construction process — either as part of a financial plan
  drawn up by an adviser or an informal strategy document. This will often take the
  form of splitting your portfolio into different investment buckets for specific
  markets or sectors with a low correlation to reduce the likelihood of concentrated
  losses. For example, holding a mix of riskier assets like equities, real estate
  and credit along with defensive assets like government and investment grade bonds,
  and cash to smooth returns over time. Or spreading your portfolio across geographies,
  even within the same asset type.\n\n## Dollar-cost averaging\n\nOne investment strategy
  for mitigating volatility is known as [dollar-cost averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp).
  Market fluctuations are less relevant for those with long-term investment horizons
  and this practice allows savvy investors to exploit lower prices rather than lock
  in losses by irrationally selling at the bottom of the market. Dollar cost averaging
  involves investing a set amount of money in a particular stock (or other asset type)
  at regular periods over the long term. This strategy can help to reduce the impact
  of short term price volatility risk to a portfolio and maximise its long-term growth
  by smoothing out the market’s ups and downs and potentially lower the average cost
  of fund purchases.\n\nRegularly investing a fixed amount using a dollar-cost averaging
  strategy means purchasing more shares when the share price declines and fewer shares
  as the price increases. This can seem counterintuitive to investors looking to limit
  their losses in a falling market, but this is precisely the time to invest as asset
  prices are relatively cheap compared to their long term value. Take the example
  of an investor who has $12,000 to invest. Instead of investing the entire amount,
  they could invest $1,000 per month over a 12-month time period. The investor ends
  up buying more of the asset when the price falls in any given month, and fewer units
  if the price is higher. This also takes away the risk of trying to \"time the market\"
  or pick the bottom of the market. Over time, dollar-cost averaging may result in
  a lower average cost per share than investing a lump sum.\n\n## The role of cash\n\nSome
  of the worst historical short-term stock market losses have been followed by significant
  rebounds — a trend seen again in 2020 as the brief Covid-19 bear market of February
  and March gave way to a steady but uneven recovery. This volatility and market correction
  created an opportunity for investors with cash on hand to buy investments at a discount.
  \n\nDuring periods of increased volatility, the correlations between individual
  stock prices tend to be lower during periods of volatility, often creating distinct
  \"winners\" and “losers” that strongly over, or underperform the broader market.
  Investors armed with a portfolio allocation to cash are [well positioned to act
  when these opportunities arise](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-advisor/when-volatility-means-opportunity/),
  while also mitigating the impact a falling market would have on their portfolio
  were they ‘fully invested’ at the time.\n\nHowever, investors also need to be aware
  of the potential risks of actively investing during times of volatility. Choosing
  to stay invested rather than trying to time the market — effectively a \"set and
  forget\" strategy— avoids situations where highly volatile market conditions affect
  trading. In particular, investors using an online broker should be aware that market-maker
  firms may experience delays in executing trades or provide incorrect quotes. In
  extreme cases — pandemics, wars, deaths of presidents and natural disasters — markets
  may close or market makers may temporarily discontinue normal automatic order executions
  and handle orders manually. \n\n## Stay on top of volatility by tracking all of
