:content: "Today we're proud to announce [Sharesight Canada](/ca/)!\n\nCanadian DIY
  and professional investors can now sign up to Sharesight to track their local and
  overseas investments in Canadian dollars.\n\nThere's a lot of buzz about being a
  \"global\" company these days, but to gain real traction, we believe you need to
  be hyper-local. Products needs to solve local problems from the ground-up.\n\n![Sharesight
  Canada - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2SXq0pezTOyssiYecCE8Ss/65ba5051411967de7481814588908cf9/featured_sharesight-canada.png?w=950)\n\nThat's
  why [we now support](/blog/global-stock-markets/) the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE),
  the Canadian Venture Exchange (CVE), and the Canadian Securities Exchange (CNSX).
  Very soon we'll be adding a [Canadian Capital Gains Tax Report](/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report/)
  and [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/) too.\n\nThe
  plan is to continue building out Canadian-specific features and to put sales and
  support staff on the ground in Toronto. In fact Angela, our marketing guru and token
  Canadian, is headed over there next week to scope things out.\n\nAll plans are available
  -- from the [Free plan](/ca/pricing/) to [Sharesight Pro Gold](/ca/pro/). [Our API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api)
  also supports Canada. We're in discussions to integrate with Canadian brokers, two
  accounting platforms, and a roboadvisor.\n\n![Doug Morris, Sharesight CEO](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2SkuffT2hWOuK8SQAKCAog/6821766f2e91d4712c5f84cdf50eb5ea/Doug-Morris_The-Australian.png?w=950)\n\n<small>*Sharesight

  Australia*</small>\n\nCanadians are avid equity investors. Their strong banking,
  resource, and energy sectors mirror the behaviour we see from our Australian client
  base. They also enjoy a competitive (bank and non-bank) online brokerage market
  and access to RRSPs (Registered Retirement Savings Plans), which are similar to
  IRAs in the US and SMSFs in Australia.\n\nThe professional advice market is significant
  as well, and the move next year to fully disclose how advisors are paid and the
  returns they've delivered to investors will cause a market shake-up. Just like in
  other Sharesight markets, it's nearly impossible for investors to understand exactly
  how they've performed -- and -- there's a dearth of solutions for well-intentioned
  money managers.\n\nWe expect to see Canadian DIY investors demanding web-based tools
  that \"just work,\" and a distinct separation between fee-hungry advisors and those
  truly creating wealth.\n\n**A big thank you to our beta clients who gave us a hand
  in testing the Canadian version. [Leave a message in our community forum](https://community.sharesight.com)
  and let us know where you'd like to see Sharesight go next.**\n\n### More on this
