  What cryptocurrencies does Sharesight track?\n\nInvestors can track 8 different
  cryptocurrencies in Sharesight:\n\n* Bitcoin (XBT)\n\n* Ethereum (ETH)\n\n* Ripple
  (XRP)\n\n* Litecoin (LTC)\n\n* Stellar (XLM)\n\n* Dash (DAS)\n\n* Monero (XMR)\n\n*
  Bitshare (BTS)\n\nIf you are invested in cryptocurrencies outside this list, you
  can still manually track them using the [custom investments feature](https://help.sharesight.com/au/unquoted-instruments/).\n\n<details>\n<summary>What
  if I trade cryptocurrencies not supported by Sharesight?</summary>\n<br>\n<h2>What
  if I trade cryptocurrencies not supported by Sharesight?</h2>\n<p>If you trade cryptocurrencies
  other than the 8 that are <a href=\"https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/\">supported
  by Sharesight</a>, you can still track your investments by adding a <a href=\"https://help.sharesight.com/unquoted-instruments/\">Custom
  Investment</a> into your Sharesight portfolio.\n\nTo add a Custom Investment, simply
  click ‘Add New Holding’ on the Portfolio Overview or Holdings page, and select ‘Add
  a custom investment’ from the top right-hand corner of the Manual Holding screen.\n<br>\n<img

  alt=\"Tracking crypto custom investments\">\n<small> When entering a cryptocurrency
  custom investment into Sharesight, make sure to select the country of the fiat currency
  used to purchase your cryptocurrency. </small>\n\nOnce you have created a Custom
  Investment, you will be redirected to the Manual Holding screen to add details such
  as the trade date, trade type, quantity and price. To track the performance of your
  crypto investment in your portfolio, simply update the price movements by uploading
  a spreadsheet of prices or manually entering the price movements on a regular basis.
  \n\nIf you are tracking custom crypto investments along with the rest of the stocks
  in your portfolio, it is also advised that you classify your investments using the
  <a href=\"https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/\">Custom
  Groups</a> feature to easily differentiate between these different asset classes.</p>\n</details>\n<p/>\n\n##
  Tracking cryptocurrencies in USD\n\nIf you commonly trade cryptocurrencies on international
  exchanges, you might prefer to see the values denominated in a particular [fiat
  currency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp) such as USD (if you
  trade USD/XBT pairs, for example). However, if the fiat currency differs from the
  currency of the [tax residency](https://help.sharesight.com/au/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/)
  of your Sharesight portfolio, you will need to [add a separate Sharesight portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/au/add_portfolio/)
  with a tax residency that uses that particular fiat currency.\n\n## How to track
