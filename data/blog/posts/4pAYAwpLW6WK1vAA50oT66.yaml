:title: What is a dividend yield trap?
:url_slug: what-is-a-dividend-yield-trap
:content: "In an increasingly [low-return world](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-maximise-returns-in-a-low-return-world/),
  many investors turn to equities that pay strong dividends as a steady source of
  income to grow their returns. These \"dividend investors\" screen stocks on the
  basis of *dividend yield*. While investing in high dividend yielding stocks can
  be a good income strategy, it can lead to what’s known as a *yield trap*,  *dividend
  trap*, or *dividend yield trap*.\n\n![What is a dividend yield trap](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6PblN0ucp2yr13R35GSNh9/8e7fe31217674eca291c510882fd4b54/What_is_a_dividend_yield_trap.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is dividend yield?\n\nDividend yield is the ratio of dividends distributed
  by a company during the year, divided by its share price. For example, if a company
  paid an annualised dividend of $5 and its current share price was $50, its dividend
  yield would be 10%. While it’s a simple ratio, it helps investors estimate the income
  yield they would earn from dividends by investing in a particular stock for a year.\n\n##
  What’s a good dividend yield?\n\nMany investors consider a \"good\" yield as one
  that pays above the existing cash rate. A good dividend yield will vary depending
  on: the sector, interest rates and general business conditions.\n\n![Dividend Yield
  Stocks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7qd8WzXF4fxUh6e2y5gUAU/c2577725df7b25850e9607b56211e56c/Dividend_Yield_Stocks.png?w=950)\n<small>(Examples
  of high dividend yields in Sharesight)</small>\n\n## Why is seeking dividend yield
  potentially a trap?\n\nThe formula for dividend yield is:\n\nDividend yield = Annualised
  dividend payout per share / Stock price per share\n\nThis means that the dividend
  yield can increase if either the dividend payout increases **_or_** if the stock
  price decreases. If the stock price decrease is due to a fundamental issue with
  the underlying business, then you are buying into an underperforming company.\n\n*Hence,
  the term dividend yield trap.*\n\nAs life expectancies increase, many retirees and
  dividend investors are likely to be in a retirement phase for 30-40 years. Therefore
  it’s important to look beyond just a stock’s dividend yield. Looking at the total
  shareholder return *including both dividends and capital growth* is key to make
  investments last a lifetime.\n\n## What are the signs of a dividend trap?\n\nAs
  a point of illustration, the chart below shows the dividend yield of the [MSCI World
  ex-Australia and also the ASX200](https://www.rba.gov.au/chart-pack/share-markets.html).
  The highest dividend yield occurred in 2009, when the stock prices were at their
  lowest ever. This data point shows that relying solely on the dividend yield is
  not sufficient.\n\n![Dividiend Yield ASX vs MSCI](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2YurrXUbPrJvfC5xTGcAAi/1d65e0ce4c7c72f183ca42212dc16ab8/Dividiend_Yield_ASX_vs_MSCI.png?w=950)\n\nWhile
  there’s no prescribed formula for spotting a dividend trap, some simple ratios should
  unearth more questions about the stock.\n\n1. **Is the yield over-indexing against
  industry peers?** Some industries are known to have high dividend yields. But if
  a stock’s dividends are completely out of line with the rest of the sector, then
  it’s something to watch out for.\n\n2. **Debt to equity ratio of the company**:
  If a company has too much debt, then it’s a warning sign for equity investors. Should
  there be a slower growth or any issues with the company, dividends will be impacted.\n\n3.
  **One-off profits**: It’s important to look for any one-off profits driving dividend
  announcements and instead look at cash flow statements of the business.\n\n4. **Dividend
  payout ratio**: If the ratio of dividends paid out to shareholders to the company’s
  net earnings is greater than 100%, that’s a sure shot warning sign. This implies
  that the company might be using dividends as a temporary appeasement of shareholders
  because of lacklustre share price performance.\n\n## What do investors look for
  instead?\n\nSo far we’ve discussed how to spot a dividend yield trap. Here are some
  qualities to look for in  great dividend yield stocks:\n\n* History of dividends
  over a long period and dividend growth\n\n* Earnings growth\n\n* Leverage and use
  of debt on the balance sheet\n\n* Performance outlook for the company and its industry\n\n##
  How to use Sharesight to look at dividend and growth for a stock\n\nWith Sharesight,
  you can review the past performance and dividend history of any stock, ETF or fund
  in our database from [over 40 leading global markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/)
  with the [Share Checker tool](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/quickly-view-the-performance-of-any-stock-with-the-share-checker/).
  While past performance is not always the best indicator of future performance, it’s
  important to consider a stock’s history before looking toward their future prospects.\n\nHere’s
  an overview chart on Sharesight of Canadian Utilities Ltd listed on the TSX.\n\n![TSX

  inspection of the income section shows consistent dividend and dividend growth for
  the stock.\n\n![TSX Dividends](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3Lr4FwUKcSZrsisE2jTsmB/1f774139dbdf72bc6269c31881043ef6/TSX_Dividends.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Key takeaway\n\nDividend yield in isolation is not always a good measure for deciding
  whether to invest in a stock. Before considering dividend yield, it’s important
  to consider the fundamental business conditions in which the company operates and
  whether the stock in question has a strong history of dividend payouts to get a
  complete picture of the company. With Sharesight, dividend investors are better
  prepared because they see the complete picture of their performance, including both
  dividends (which Sharesight [automatically tracks](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/))
  and [annualised returns](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/).
