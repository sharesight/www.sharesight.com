:title: Track cash & fixed interest investments via Xero
:url_slug: track-cash-fixed-interest-investments-via-xero
:content: "We’re happy to announce that [Sharesight](/) now integrates with all bank
  accounts that are available using [Xero](/xero/) bank feeds! This means that within
  Sharesight you can track your cash balances and display reconciled buys, sells,
  and dividends automatically.\n\n![Xero Cash for Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1MXdU9RjFu06qu2s4ugaUk/e88f5d360c302bbc9bca67f930f1e161/blog_xero-cash.png?w=950)\n\nWe’ve
  been on a cash kick lately. After all, last time we checked, cash was still considered
  king. Recently we announced that [Sharesight integrates with Macquarie Cash Management
  Accounts (CMAs)](/blog/sharesight-integrates-macquarie-cash-management-account/)
  so that [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) clients can properly reconcile and track their clients’
  cash positions. Now the same is true for any bank or broker-linked cash account
  for all Sharesight clients using Xero. \n\nWe receive a lot of feedback regarding
  cash handling. Cash means different things to different investors. While we could’ve
  gone down the road of building a Xero-lite and offered some basic reconciliation
  and double-entry accounting, it was clear that letting Xero do what they do brilliantly
  was the smarter move.\n\n### So what does this mean for your Sharesight portfolios?\n\nUltimately,
  when you add a cash account to Sharesight via Xero, we’ll pull back your cash balance
  and the transactional details at the end of each day. So if you set up a bank feed
  in Xero to your broker’s cash account (e.g. the Commsec CDIA account), this means
  that your cash position, including reconciled buys, sells, and dividends will be
  displayed automatically throughout Sharesight and on our [reports](https://help.sharesight.com/reports/).\n\n![Sharesight
  & Xero Cash](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5HOdsGNuX6aSuoWEWYqmcO/eb4443324a111e1bdd8a3a11258ec028/Sharesight-Xero-Cash.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  get started, add a cash account from our new Add Holding dropdown menu.\n\n![Add
  Cash Account](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6a8EeDqJIQCIGYwKIWgAAW/5443fc4136bca662597b156e48246ab9/Sharesight-Add-Cash-Account.png?w=950)\n\nNext
  you’ll want to connect to Xero. You’ll be asked to login to Xero directly on Sharesight
  if you haven’t done so already for sending your portfolio data to Xero. You’ll be
  prompted to select which Xero organisation you want to use: \n\n![Xero Organization](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5lnSc7lEjKq6K2C82WkYiw/e0329344fd002a5dd0557ea25fb97418/Select-Xero-Org.png?w=950)\n\nAnd
  to pick which bank account to connect to. Just give the account a name, which will
  be used across Sharesight:\n\n![Select Bank Account](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7kEldXHeqko4MMyIAgM4kK/f5b4603c4f7666588640c0f05a094757/Select-Bank-Account.png?w=950)\n\nOnce
  the account is created, Sharesight will pull in the historical bank transactions
  and the current balance. You can search for particular transactions and export it
  into Excel or PDF. The cash data on Sharesight will now automatically update itself
  each day with no manual intervention required. On the [Portfolio Overview](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/)
  page, your cash balance will be displayed. Clicking into this holding will show
  you the latest transactions.\n\n![Sharesight Cash Accounts](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5QJNfqjPAAESMag4w4MWue/cdcf9459c47713bd886d3551b801951d/Sharesight-Cash-Account1.png?w=950)\n\nClients
  of Sharesight and Xero now have a full, 360 degree solution. Trade and dividend
  data collected by Sharesight is pushed, in real time, to Xero for accounting purposes.
  While cash data is now pushed from Xero back into Sharesight for portfolio tracking
  purposes.\n\nWhat’s more, **we’ve created an Unsettled Trades Adjustment option**.
  If the cash account is used as the trade settlement account, using this feature
  will automatically offset for the T+3 rule. In other words, Sharesight will temporarily
  adjust your cash balance until the cash is debited/credited for the trade so that
  an accurate cash balance is always maintained. If you don’t use the cash as the
  settlement account, you can switch this feature off within the Portfolio Settings
  tab.\n\n### The age of siloed financial data and client ownership is over\nWe talk
  a lot about an ecosystem of connected, best-of-breed apps and about encouraging
  our clients to try them on. Let Sharesight do what we do best and let Xero do what
  they do best. We’ll handle the connection behind the scenes, and all you have to
  do is have two tabs open in your browser. We think you’re up to the challenge.\n\n###
