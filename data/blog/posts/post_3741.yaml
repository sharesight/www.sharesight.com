:title: Maintaining your share portfolio just got a whole lot easier
:url_slug: maintaining-your-portfolio-just-got-a-whole-lot-easier
:content: "Our aim at [Sharesight](/) is to make share market investing and maintaining
  your share portfolio as easy as possible for you. \n\nWith that aim in mind we have
  developed an exciting new feature that will automate the recording of your buy and
  sell trades into your Sharesight portfolio. This will save you the hassle of having
  to manually record new trades into your Sharesight portfolio each time you buy and
  sell.\n\n## How does this work?\nSharesight provides you with a unique email address
  and you instruct your Broker to send a copy of each of your Trade Confirmation Emails
  to this address.\n\nEach time we receive a copy of the Trade Confirmation Email
  from your broker, Sharesight will automatically create a trade in your portfolio.
  The trade will contain a comment to indicate it was created from a contact note
  sent via email. Emails are typically processed in around 10 minutes. As soon as
  the trade has been processed you will receive a confirmation email from Sharesight
  containing a link to the newly created trade.\n\nWe urge you to try this new feature
  because the more Trade Confirmation Emails we receive the more brokers we will be
  able to cover and the more comprehensive and reliable the system will become.\n\nProcessing
  PDF files can be a tricky business so we’ll be fine tuning things as we go along
  to increase accuracy and reliability. The more Trade Confirmation Emails you send
  us the better the system will become. Please use our [community forum](https://community.sharesight.com)
  to let us know if you run into any issues.\n\n## Here's how to get started\n\n###
  Step 1 – Make a note of the email address for your portfolio\nTo view the email
  address for your portfolio, you must enable the Trade Confirmation Emails function.
  To do this, first click the 'Integrations' tab in your portfolio, then select 'Trade
  Confirmation Emails´. Once enabled, the email address for your portfolio will be
  displayed. This is the email address where you will send your Trade Confirmation
  Emails for processing.\n\n### Step 2 – Check that we currently support your broker\nWe
  maintain an up-to-date list of [supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/).
  If your broker is not on the list, ask us to support your broker by submitting an
  'idea' to the [community forum](https://community.sharesight.com). If someone else
  has already suggested that we add your broker, please click the +1 button to add
  you vote. This will allow us to prioritise support for additional brokers.\n\n###
  Step 3 – Send through your Trade Confirmation Emails\nBecause this feature is new
  we suggest that you manually forward through your first few Trade Confirmation Emails
  before setting things up with your broker. To do this simply forward your contract
  note email to the email address generated in Step 1, ensuring that the name of the
  broker (as per our list of supported brokers) is in the subject line of the email.\n\nYou
  will receive an email confirming whether or not the email was successfully processed.
  Please allow 10 minutes or so for the processing to complete. You can view the current
  status of your email by clicking on the ‘view contract notes’ button (under Settings
  >> General >> Edit Settings).\n\nOnce you have confirmed that your Trade Confirmation
  Emails are able to be processed successfully, you can instruct you broker to send
  a copy of your future contract notes to the email address generated in step 1.\n\nFor
  full help documentation visit [Importing Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/).\n\nAs
  always, we look forward to your [feedback](https://community.sharesight.com) to
  help us make Sharesight even better for you.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Blog -- [7
