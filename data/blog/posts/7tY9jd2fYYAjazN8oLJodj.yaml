  ## What is the Korea Exchange (KRX)?

  The [Korea Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Exchange) was established in 2005 after the Korea Stock Exchange, Korea Futures Exchange and KOSDAQ Stock Market merged and is now the sole securities exchange in South Korea with operations in Seoul and Butan.

  Sharesight tracks almost 2,000 listings on the KRX exchange including stocks, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
