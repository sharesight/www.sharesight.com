:title: Track stocks on the Nasdaq Nordic exchanges with Sharesight
:content: "With Sharesight, investors can easily track stocks listed on the Nasdaq
  Nordic exchanges for Stockholm, Copenhagen, Iceland and Helsinki. This is in addition
  to the [Oslo Stock Exchange](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-on-the-oslo-stock-exchange-ose-with-sharesight/)
  and [more than 30 major stock exchanges](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)
  spanning Europe and the rest of the world. This gives European investors access
  to Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n![image 0 nordic](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4tVIhm2wB9xtubs05fD5Pw/600fe540b282e8a77f173831bc3b7c1c/image_0_nordic.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is Nasdaq Nordic?\n\n[Nasdaq Nordic](https://www.nasdaqomxnordic.com/), also
  known as the OMX Nordic Exchanges, operates exchanges in Europe’s Nordic region,
  which includes Stockholm (STO), Copenhagen (CPH), Iceland (ICE) and Helsinki (HEL).
  Nasdaq and OMX officially merged in 2008, creating the Nasdaq OMX Group, which operates
  across the Nordic, Baltic and Caucasus regions of Europe. \n\nSharesight tracks
  more than 1,000 stocks and ETFs listed on the Nasdaq Nordic, with more stocks continually
  being added over time. This is in addition to over 250 stocks listed on the Oslo
  Stock Exchange, plus stocks in major European markets such as the Euronext, London
  Stock Exchange (LSE) and Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FRA).\n\n## How to track the
  Nasdaq Nordic exchanges on Sharesight\n\n1. If you’re not using Sharesight yet,
  sign up for a [FREE account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup) to start tracking
  your portfolio. \n\n2. Add your holdings to your portfolio by searching for the
  relevant stock code under the market code **STO** for Stockholm, **CSE** for Copenhagen,
  **ICE** for Iceland or **HEL** for Helsinki. Alternatively, you can add holdings
  through Sharesight’s [File Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  feature.  **Note:** While CPH is commonly used as the market code for the Copenhagen
  Stock Exchange, it is listed under CSE in Sharesight. \n\n3. Sharesight will automatically
  fill in the price history for your holdings. It will also backfill past dividends
  (and continue to add new ones as they are announced) – plus factor in the impact
  of any currency fluctuations on your performance.\n\n![image 1 Nordic](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/755lC5wbXs3lblIiKWewi9/f68938eb41468d41b48975296f395ea3/image_1_Nordic.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Searching
