:title: 4 ways Sharesight is better than Google Finance
:content: "If you actively manage your own investments, having an accurate, timely
  and complete picture of your portfolio and the investment opportunities you are
  watching is vital. Many investors turn to dedicated tools such as Google Finance
  to help fill this information gap, only to find it falls short for their needs.
  If you’re looking for a Google Finance alternative to see what’s missing from your
  financial picture, you need a dedicated investment portfolio tracker like Sharesight.\n\nHere
  are 4 ways Sharesight is better than Google Finance, and how these key differences
  can help you become a better investor with the full picture of your investment performance.
  \n\n![image 0 Sharesight better than Google Finance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5hTwI1QcQANFuO9nINBaf6/881830af2b75739fa1ce9667dcee56d2/image_0_Sharesight_better_than_Google_Finance.jpg?w=950)\n\n###
  Google Finance – built to track stock watchlists\n\nGoogle Finance’s easy to use
  watchlist tool is useful for investors seeking new buying opportunities and basic
  stock research, but when it comes to your performance, daily price movements and
  percentage gains only tell half the story. To get the full picture of your returns,
  you need a tool like Sharesight that takes into account key factors such as dividends
  and foreign exchange rates. \n\nBecause Sharesight is designed from the ground up
  as a full featured portfolio tracker, when you [track a watchlist](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investment-watchlist-stocks-with-sharesight/)[
  portfolio you can take advantage of a number of advanced features](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investment-watchlist-stocks-with-sharesight/),
  including the ability to track investment \"themes\" using [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  watch the price movements of stocks on international exchanges inclusive of foreign
  exchange impacts and dividends, and watch the performance of over 170,000 stocks,
  ETFs and funds from more than 36 global markets going back 20 years. \n\n## Track
  your investment performance \n\nWhen it comes to actually calculating the performance
  of your investment portfolio, Google Finance’s watchlist portfolio falls short compared
  to a dedicated [portfolio performance tracker](https://www.sharesight.com/investment-portfolio-performance/)
  like Sharesight. To understand why Sharesight is a superior solution for investors,
  let’s take a look at a basket of tech stocks in Google Finance compared to Sharesight.
  \n\n![image 1 Google Finance tech stocks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4pmHkxC36ydmsmYvmgyXXQ/0740a67500644d8b879e4c9e1b993655/image_1_Google_Finance_tech_stocks.png?w=950)\n<small>
  Designed solely to track stock watchlists, Google Finance primarily focuses on daily
  price movements. </small>\n\nThe screenshot example above shows what this looks
  like in Google Finance. As you can see, Google Finance is limited to daily price/percentage
  gains. If you click into a stock, you will see some additional details of the stock’s
  price performance over different fixed periods, along with some fundamentals data
  such as the market cap, dividend yield and P/E ratio. \n\nIn comparison, Sharesight
  is a more complete solution, designed for the needs of self-directed investors who
  need to track investment performance across different asset classes, markets, currencies
  and brokers. Here is what the same basket of stocks looks like in Sharesight: \n\n![image

  With Sharesight, investors get the full picture of their portfolio’s returns. </small>
  \n\nAs you can see, the difference between Google Finance and Sharesight is that
  Sharesight is designed to give investors the full picture of their portfolio’s returns,
  with an annualised [performance calculation methodology](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  that includes the impact of capital gains and losses, dividends, brokerage fees
  and currency fluctuations. This annualised return methodology  makes comparing the
  performance of different investments and timeframes easy, helping investors make
  decisions on where to invest, with the best information available. \n\nLike Google
  Finance, Sharesight also provides basic stock fundamentals (for AU/NZ) and stock
  news (for AU, NZ, US and UK), as can be seen in the screenshot example below. \n\n![image
  3 Sharesight news and fundamentals](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2TrPazIKoCjhF8aDV5uG6C/153a77e51d2aae709419df54549c562d/image_3_Sharesight_news_and_fundamentals.png?w=950)\n<small>
  By clicking into an individual holding, you can see basic stock fundamentals data
  and news. </small>\n\n## Why you need to be tracking dividends\n\nAnother important
  difference between Sharesight and Google Finance is that Sharesight [automatically
  records dividends and distributions](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  from investments in your portfolio. If you’re measuring a stock’s performance and
  not calculating the impact of dividend income on your total return, you’re missing
  half the picture, and a potentially significant source of investment returns. This
  can be clearly seen in the screenshot example below, which shows a stock where capital
  gains contribute -14.96% while dividends contribute 5.28%, resulting in a net total
  return of -9.68%. This highlights the importance of tracking not just capital gains
  and losses, but also dividends and [other key factors](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  that can affect your returns. \n\n![image 4 Sharesight dividend example](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4erMfidKP5nry42Gz6ckW1/b26c5fbf48559098607ac9610bf519c9/image_4_Sharesight_dividend_example.png?w=950)\n<small>
  An example showing the importance of dividend tracking when calculating a stock’s
  performance. </small>\n\nOther useful dividend features include the ability to automatically
  track [dividend reinvestment ](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)[plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)[

  needs, Sharesight offers a powerful range of reports. Designed for the needs of
  self-directed investors, these reports give investors the advanced performance and
