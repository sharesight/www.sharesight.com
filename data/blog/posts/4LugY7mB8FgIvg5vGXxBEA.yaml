:title: ASX Investor Day Sydney 2019
:content: "Approximately 800 attendees had the opportunity to listen and learn from
  some of the best people in the investing world at the ASX investor day, which took
  place at the Sydney Hilton on Saturday 29 June. This was the last event in a [series](https://www.asx.com.au/seminars/investor-day/)[
  of ASX investor Days](https://www.asx.com.au/seminars/investor-day/) held around
  Australia, and it finished off the 18/19 Australian financial year.\n\n![ASX Investor
  Day Sydney](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4zhcI03JVyJW4zalW3NxB1/e0efa4047074abe35dd55085c75cca0a/ASX_Investor_Day_Sydney.jpg?w=950)\n\nThe
  Sydney ASX event started with an update on markets and the major global events that
  are shaping the future, as presented by [Don Hamson](https://plato.com.au/about/our-team/#dr-don-hamson)
  (Managing Director, Plato Investment Management). Overall the advice was to remain
  cautious of global headwinds, as uncertainty grows in a market that is still trending
  upwards.\n\nRegarding the performance of Australian investments since the federal
  election, markets have responded to the reduction in uncertainty with an increase
  in confidence. This has been further bolstered by the June RBA rate cuts as investors
  leverage cash rates of only 1.5%. Closing this session, Hamson cautioned investors
  to stay on the lookout for [dividend traps](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-dividend-yield-trap/)
  and the impact of [ex-dividend dates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/ex-dividend-dates-and-their-impact-on-stock-prices-explained/)
  on stock prices.\n\n![ASX Investor Day](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2dLV11EN9Odn72gVwyTep/158661522b2299e757dd79dd3a391f06/ASX_Investor_Day.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  ASX stock picks panel discussion\n\nThe panel comprised of experts from investment
  management firms Fidelity International, Firetrail and Platinum, and was moderated
  by [Gemma Dale](https://www.nabtrade.com.au/investor/insights/your-wealth) (Director,
  SMSF and Investor Behaviour, nabtrade), with each member of the panel pitching one
  stock to the audience:\n\n\n### Li Ning (2331.HKG) : Anthony Doyle (Fidelity International)\n\nFor
  Li Ning, the focus was on the favoritism of Chinese markets towards Chinese companies
  and how the ongoing trade war might increase the preference for Chinese products.
  Interestingly, a quick check in Sharesight indicates that Li Ning has gone up 30%
  since it was pitched at the first ASX investor day event (28th May 2019).\n\n###
  Downer (DOW.ASX) : Kyle Macintyre (Firetrail)\n\nDowner, an infrastructure and services
  company was praised for its fundamentals and sound business model.\n\nUsing the
  [share checker feature](https://help.sharesight.com/share-checker/) in Sharesight,
  I could see that Downer has outperformed the index for the past year and returned
  a solid 8.9%, including a dividend of 5%.\n\n![Share price checker](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/jPv4vETiMAaxiCOEAcVB0/0773b353a59793c220a96ce957955cde/Share_price_checker.png?w=950)\n\n###
  BMW (BMW.FRA) : Julian McCormack (Platinum)\n\nThe heritage of BMW, with its focus
  on innovation along with maintaining a sound balance sheet was the pitch for the
  third stock. This was further demonstrated by the fact that [BMW grew almost 8%
  in China](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201901/21/WS5c453aaaa3106c65c34e5970.html)
  (one of the biggest markets for luxury vehicles) in 2018 when the overall market
  shrank for the first time since 1990.\n\nThe expert also spoke on the importance
  of seeking-out companies with a history of generating profits and to avoid the \"bubble\"
  of companies with high valuations and but without any realised results.\n\nHereâ€™s
  how these three stocks have performed since the first ASX investor day event took
  place at the end of May 2019:\n\n![Stock Performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6yXWG4ItsQhBAzGHW10Brl/d6c846a7311c725dcb02f3d98828ef6a/Stock_Performance.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Performance
  of the three pitched stocks since the first investor day event</small>\n\n## Key
  takeaways for DIY investors \n\nIn the investor stream, the topics ranged from *How
  to build a portfolio* presented by [Chris Brycki](https://www.stockspot.com.au/about-us/team/)[
  ](https://www.stockspot.com.au/about-us/team/)(CEO, Stockspot) to *Alternative investing
  strategies* presented by [Luis Sarmiento](https://www.macquarie.com/au/advisers/expertise/luis-sarmiento/)
  (Investment Specialist, Macquarie Investment Management). The key message here was
  diversification, and it is a topic we covered at-length in a recent article entitled:
  [*Investment diversification: Why does it matter*?](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/investment-diversification-why-does-it-matter/)\n\nThe
  discussion, moderated by Kris Walesby (CEO, ETF Securities), then progressed towards
  how investors can access global megatrends around robotics, AI and emerging economies
  by [investing in ](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-to-look-for-when-buying-etfs/)[ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-to-look-for-when-buying-etfs/).\n\n[Wade
  Matterson](http://www.milliman.com/Consultants/?cid=83422) (Practice Leader, Australia)
  from Milliman, then elaborated on \"expecting the unexpected\" and how to make sure
  you have enough money to fund your retirement by considering your individual needs
  and requirements, and not just following a general target.\n\nI enjoyed the event
  and look forward to the next series of ASX investor events.\n\n### Watch the ASX
