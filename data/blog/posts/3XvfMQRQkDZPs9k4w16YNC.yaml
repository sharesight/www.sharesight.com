  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nTax loss selling is a strategy that investors
  can leverage to minimise their net capital gains during a financial year for tax
  purposes. While tax loss selling can be used at any time, it is most often implemented
  in the lead up to the end of each financial year. This makes June a particularly
  good time to review your investment portfolio and decide whether to leverage a tax
  loss selling strategy to help offset any capital gains you incurred for the year.\n\nThis

  What is tax loss selling (harvesting)?\nSimply put, tax loss selling (or tax loss
  harvesting) involves selling investments that have incurred capital losses in order
  to “net out” or offset capital gains realised during the year.\n\n### Notes on tax
  loss selling\n\n- Although many investors leverage tax loss selling toward the end
  of the year, you may harvest tax losses at any time.\n\n- Higher tax rates apply
  for investments you’ve held for a year or less (short-term capital gains), than
  for investments you’ve sold after holding them for longer than a year.\n\n- The
  amount of money you can save in taxes through tax loss selling depends on your tax
  rate (individual/trust, SMSF, or company).\n\n## A tax loss selling example\nTo
  help explain how tax loss selling works, let’s look at an example calculation:\n\nLet’s
  say you were lucky enough to buy CSL (ASX: CSL) back in 2012 when it was trading
  at $32. It’s currently sitting at just under $300, so you’ve incurred a total annualised
  return of around 33%.\n\nHowever you have taken a big loss on formerly high-flying
  Retail Food Group (ASX: RFG), which you bought at $4.00 back in 2014, but is now
  only worth $0.075 per share.\n\n| Holding | Purchase Value | Market Value | Capital
  Gain |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| ASX: CSL       |
  $3,200.00       | $30,557.00      | $27,357.00      |\n| ASX: RFG       | $4,000.00
  \     | $75      | <span style=\"color:red\">$-3,925.00</span>       |\n\nWhile
  you could hold onto RFG in the hopes that it will someday bounce back, another option
  is to sell both RFG and CSL before the end of the year to offset some of the gain
  in your CSL stock with the RFG sale. Doing so may not only soften the blow of the
  loss, but also encourage you to move on to new opportunities next year.\n\n## How
  to model tax loss selling opportunities with Sharesight\nIf you hold investments
  that have suffered losses this year, Sharesight’s Unrealised CGT Report can help
  you calculate how to offset your capital gains by:\n\n<ol>\n  <li><b>Displaying
  the CGT position for all your holdings which are not yet sold</b> (if they were
  sold on the date of the report) broken down into:\n  <ul>\n    <li>Short term capital
  gains (unrealised)</li>\n    <li>Long term capital gains (unrealised)</li>\n    <li>Capital
  losses (unrealised)</li>\n  </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Modelling the capital gains
  tax</b> that would arise across your portfolio if the shares identified were sold
  on the report date.</li>\n  <li><b>Allowing you to modify the CGT sale allocation
  method</b> at the overall portfolio or individual holding level to determine your
  optimum position.</li>\n</ol>\n\n![Tax loss harvesting calculator](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/19pZPwrsY1MAbxQIlj9zZk/be2fe6c9435c32bd373a8e9bd86775c6/Tax_loss_harvesting_calculator.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  report uses the ‘[discount method](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/Working-out-your-capital-gain/The-discount-method-of-calculating-your-capital-gain/)’
  for shares that have been held for more than 1 year and the ‘other method’ for shares
  held for less than one year. The discount rate is based on the tax settings of an
  Australian portfolio:\n\n- **Individuals / Trust** – CGT discount of 50 %\n- **Self
  Managed Super Fund** – CGT discount of 33⅓ %\n- **Company** – CGT discount of nil\n\nThe
  report also allows you to specify the sale allocation method at the overall portfolio
  and individual holding level to determine your optimum position, including:\n\n-
  **First In, First Out (FIFO)** – Sharesight assumes that you sell your longest held
  shares first.\n- **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** – Sharesight assumes that you sell
  your most recently purchased shares first.\n- **Maximise Gain** – Sharesight assumes
  that you sell shares with the lowest purchase price first.\n- **Minimise Gain**
  – Sharesight assumes that you sell shares with the highest purchase price first.\n-
  **Minimise CGT** – Sharesight assumes that you sell shares that will result in the
  lowest capital gains tax first. This method is more sophisticated than the ‘Minimise
  capital gain’ method because it takes into account the Australian CGT discounting
  rules.\n\n![Capital Gains Tax Sale Allocation Methods - 2021](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2NwJViKWOajHaIE22xsVs7/0ee50c8134e93cd4c0d25b057bb8a279/Capital_Gains_Tax_Sale_Allocation_Methods_-_2021.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Notes on the Unrealised CGT Report\n\n- The Unrealised CGT report is designed for
  forecasting purposes only. Refer to the [Capital Gains Tax Report](/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  to calculate your actual (realised) taxable capital gain income for a specific period.\n-
  You may carry forward losses from the previous reporting period by clicking on the
  ‘Advanced Options’ link.\n- It’s a good idea to run the report throughout the year,
  not just at the end, in order to stay on top of opportunities to offset gains and
  losses throughout the year. You may want to [share secure portfolio access](/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/)
  with your accountant and/or adviser, so they can keep this in mind as well.\n- The
  Unrealised CGT Report is available on Australian [Investor and Expert plans](/au/pricing/).\n-

  Avoiding wash sales\nIn 2008, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) issued issued tax
  ruling [TR 2008/1](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=TXR/TR20081/NAT/ATO/00001),
  which specifically outlaws arrangements where *“...in substance there is no significant
  change in the taxpayer’s economic exposure to, or interest in, the asset, or where
  that exposure or interest may be reinstated by the taxpayer”*.\n\nIn other words,
  the ATO prevents investors from selling a stock in one financial year to take advantage
  of a capital loss event, only to buy that stock again in the new financial year.
  This is known as a “wash sale” and the ATO will disallow the loss if the sole intention
  of the sale was to minimise tax. As Sharesight Executive Director Andrew Bird [said](/blog/tax-loss-selling-made-easy/),
  “if you are going to sell, make sure you really mean it. If you still believe in
  that stock then choose a different ‘loser’ to sell to offset your gain.”\n\n## Offsetting
