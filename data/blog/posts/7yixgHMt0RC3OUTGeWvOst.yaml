  around the world, it is now easier than ever to track your investment portfolio
  on Sharesight. Investors can automatically import historical and ongoing buy and
  sell trades into a Sharesight portfolio through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  sent by most brokers, making it effortless to keep an updated portfolio.\n\n[Charles
  Stanley](https://www.charles-stanley.co.uk/) is one of the many brokers from which
  you can automatically import trades directly into your Sharesight portfolio. This
  allows Charles Stanley users to take advantage of Sharesight’s award-winning performance,

  Who is Charles Stanley?\n\nFounded in 1792, [Charles Stanley](https://www.charles-stanley.co.uk/)
  is a UK-based investment management firm with a well-established history in Europe.
  Its online trading platform, [Charles Stanley Direct](https://www.charles-stanley-direct.co.uk/),

  investment trusts and ETFs, with a brokerage fee of £11.50 per trade. \n\n## Import
  your Charles Stanley data to Sharesight\n\nSharesight allows you to import your
  historical and ongoing trades through the Trade Confirmation Emails feature, or
  you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading a spreadsheet
  file. Keep reading to learn more. \n\n## How to import historical trades through
  a spreadsheet \n\nOne simple way to import historical trades to Sharesight is by
  creating and formatting a [ spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1)
  filled with trades from your trading account.\n\n![Sharesight Charles Stanley spreadsheet](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4CM9ZP3rIFH7kp21f4TKdz/30425fb67aeae3d4e23817d17d05ea5e/Sharesight_Charles_Stanley_spreadsheet.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio. \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** This feature is designed primarily for ongoing
  trades, but it can also be used to fill in historical trades in your Sharesight
  portfolio. All you need to do is manually forward the Trade Confirmation Emails
  for the trades you wish to see in your portfolio, starting with the earliest trade
  you want included. \n\n## We need your help to add more brokers!\n\nIf your broker
  is not yet on [Sharesight’s list of supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/),
  contact us by leaving a message in the chat interface located at the bottom-right
  of Sharesight. All we will need is some sample buy and sell trade confirmations
  (email or PDF), the email the broker sends them from and the subject line of the
  emails.\n\nWe only require a few sample documents to support a new broker, so reach
  out today if you want to see yours added!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n* [Getting started
