:title: Portfolio sharing between generations
:url_slug: sharing-between-generations
:content: "The decision to take control of your own share investments and run your
  portfolio yourself is one that, with the right management tools and information
  at hand, has many advantages – something we’ve discussed in numerous other blogs.\n\nWhat
  we’d like to focus on here is an uncomfortable issue that many of us like to skirt
  around – often until it’s too late. And that is, what happens to a share portfolio
  when its owner passes away. The simple fact is that older people are more likely
  to own shares, and in most cases will pass them, along with their other assets,
  on to family members after their death.\n\nHowever, unlike other more tangible assets,
  such as property, unless the portfolio is in order and records meticulously kept,
  even the most generous and well-meaning bequest can result in beneficiaries and
  executors spending an enormous amount of time, effort and yes, money, trying to
  unravel the portfolio.\n\nThat includes determining exactly what the holdings are
  in the first place, assessing the taxation status relating to dividends and, in
  Australia, capital gains. And that’s even before any decisions about what to do
  with the portfolio itself -- whether to break it up, sell part or all of it and
  so forth, are made.\n\nWe’ve all heard stories about beneficiaries and executors
  spending months or even longer digging through piles of paperwork kept in shoe boxes
  and following elusive paper trails in the hope of getting a clear picture of a parent
  or relative’s true financial situation. \n\nOf course, that’s not the case for all
  investors. Many take a different path, because they want to avoid passing on that
  kind of impost on to their families. Concerned about how their hard earned and often
  closely studied portfolios will be understood and managed after their death, in
  their later years one popular option for these investors is to simply cash out of
  their portfolios.\n\nThe fact that they are often forced to do so at a time that’s
  not of their choosing and may as a consequence erode the potential future value
  of their shares is a trade-off that many will make in the interests of clarity for
  their estate.\n\nHowever, we would like to alert share investors to a clearer, easier
  and potentially more profitable path. Whether you’re the DIY investor considering
  estate planning or the relative and beneficiary of the investor, using [Sharesight](/)
  to manage the portfolio in question offers a clear, simple solution.\n\nSharesight
  provides a comprehensive list of all holdings in the portfolio and detailed, up-to-the-minute
  records relating to all the activity within it for taxation purposes. Further, it
  also gives the performance information needed to help both the investor and beneficiaries
  make informed decisions about whether, when and what elements of the portfolio should
  be sold.\n\nAnother key benefit Sharesight offers for investors in this situation
  is its [portfolio sharing](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/) feature.
  This enables the investor to allow others log-in privileges, so they can either
  view the portfolio, via ‘read-only’ access or, actually participate in its management,
  via ‘full access’ functionality.\n\nImagine both of you being able to chat on the
  phone about the portfolio with the screens open in front of you. It’s an ideal way
  to help a relative or executor become familiar with the portfolio and its performance
  before it becomes an estate matter, and an easy way to open up what can be a difficult
  or uncomfortable dialogue. \n\nThe portfolio sharing feature can also help DIY investors
  retain control and visibility of their portfolios if they become ill or infirm.
  A trusted relative or associate, such as an adviser, can continue to manage the
  portfolio in the manner that’s been agreed, leaving the investor with peace of mind
  about his or her share investments and the ability to access them at will.\n\nSo
  if you’re a DIY investor thinking about your family’s future, or someone who’s concerned
  about managing the affairs of your parents or other relatives after they pass away,
  now’s the time to start talking – and to look to Sharesight for the help you need.\n\n###
