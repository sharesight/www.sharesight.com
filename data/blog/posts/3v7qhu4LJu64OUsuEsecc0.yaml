:title: Millennial investors smash avocado myth in ASX report
:content: "Contrary to the stereotype that millennials imprudently spend all their
  money on expensive smashed avocado breakfasts, the [ASX has revealed](http://www.asx.com.au/documents/resources/2017-asx-investor-study.pdf)
  the number of millennial investors in Australia has almost doubled over the last
  5 years. Young investors (18-24yo) now make up 20% of Australian investors (up from
  10% in 2012), with the proportion of Gen Y investors (25-34yo) increasing from 24%
  to 39% of individuals investing over the same period. \n \nWhile the absolute number
  of millennial investors has increased significantly during this time, as a cohort
  they are under-represented within the population -- totalling only 9% of Australian
  investors, yet making up 12% of the Australian population.\n \nDo you fit the profile
  of the ‘typical’ millennial investor? Read on to find out.\n\n![Featured Smashed

  Millennial investor profile\n\nThe financial goals of millennials differ to mature
  investors, prioritising the more immediate goals of saving for a home deposit or
  travel over planning for their retirement. Not wishing to lose their hard earned
  principal investment, 81% of young investors seek guaranteed or reliable investment
  returns, making them the most risk averse of any any age group.  \n \nOn average,
  young investors have both higher incomes and significantly higher total household
  wealth than non-investors of the same age, with intergenerational wealth transfers
  from family trusts and the financially literacy of parents important bootstraps
  as a young investor. \n \nMillennial investors are socially responsible in their
  investment strategies. According to [CFSGAM](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/millennials-set-to-change-the-investment-landscape)
  85% of millennials now consider their investments as a way to express their personal
  values  and 93% believe a company’s “social, political and environmental impact
  in is important when making an investment decision.”\n\n## Millennial investment
  advice\n\nThe use of financial or investment advice by millennials lags the Australian
  investor population. Only 37% of young investors pay for financial advice compared
  to 45% of the overall population. Among millennial investors who do not use professional
  advice, the two most cited reasons were that: \n \n1. Advice was too expensive for
  them to obtain; and \n2. Their investment was too small to need advice.\n3.  \nYoung
  investors are however embracing low-cost financial advice online, including ‘robo-advice’
  (such as that offered by [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com) partner [Six Park](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-a-new-partner--six-park/))
  at higher rates than older investors, with 15% of those surveyed by the ASX willing
  to embrace automated investment advice, compared to just 4% of those over 60.\n\n##
  Mobile investment apps\n\nOnline financial advice isn’t the only area millennial
  investors are ahead of their more established counterparts. [CommSec recently revealed](https://www.commbank.com.au/guidance/newsroom/record-number-millennials-share-investing-201706.html)
  that millennials now make up over 50% of all trades conducted through the CommSec
  mobile app. \n \nSimilarly, Sharesight’s millennial users are 35% more likely than
  non-millennials to track their investment portfolio with Sharesight using a mobile
  device. If you haven’t yet, install [Sharesight’s mobile app](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-mobile-app--april-2017-update/)
  (perfect for millennials and non-millennials alike) to make it even easier to track
  your investment portfolio anywhere, anytime.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Blog -- [How
