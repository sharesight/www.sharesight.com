:title: 7 reasons to upgrade your Sharesight account
:url_slug: 7-reasons-to-upgrade-your-sharesight-account
:content: "[Sharesight](/) makes it easy to track various investments in one place
  -- everything from shares, ETFs, and managed/mutual funds, to foreign currencies
  (including [cryptocurrencies](/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)).
  And while you can track 10 holdings for free, upgrading your Sharesight account
  provides time-saving features and unparalleled insights into how your investments
  are doing.\n\n### [Upgrade today](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/plans/new) to
  unlock these 7 premium Sharesight benefits:\n\n## 1. More portfolios + unlimited
  holdings\n\n[Sharesight’s Free plan](/pricing/) is limited to a single portfolio
  with 10 holdings. When you step up to an Investor or Expert plan, you unlock additional
  portfolios and support for unlimited holdings!\n\n### Benefits of multiple portfolios\n\n-
  Track your retirement portfolio ([SMSF](/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/),
  [RRSP/RRIF](/blog/rrsp-and-rrif-canadian-tax-settings-in-sharesight-portfolios/),
  [TFSA](/blog/track-your-tfsa-with-sharesight/), [KiwiSaver](/blog/how-do-i-track-my-kiwisaver-fund/),
  etc) separately from your other portfolios\n- Easily track investments held by family
  members (and [share secure access with them](/blog/sharesight-portfolio-sharing-now-on-all-plans-even-free/))\n-
  Use a [Consolidated View](/blog/new-functionality-for-consolidated-views/) to track
  your performance across multiple portfolios\n- Create an investment watchlist to
  keep an eye on potential buying opportunities \n\n## 2. Powerful tax reports\n\nThe
  [Unrealised Capital Gains Report](https://help.sharesight.com/unrealised_cgt_report/)
  allows you to calculate unrealised capital gains in an Australian portfolio to help
  you model how the resulting taxable income would impact your capital gains if particular
  shares were sold on the reporting date.\n\nThis report allows you to implement strategies
  such as [tax loss selling](/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/), and
  make decisions to sell shares before the end of financial year to realise a capital
  gain event as part of your broader investment strategy.\n\n![unrealised-cgt-report-2019
  sharesight 2021](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/8uX0PWdgBPNWvwZE9DOPi/70e0399f4d845cd03df27ab9f24cbb05/unrealised-cgt-report-2019_sharesight_2021.png?w=950)\n\nFor
  those of you managing portfolios in other regions, upgrading your Sharesight account
  provides you with the following region-specific tax reports:\n\n- Canada: [Canadian
  Capital Gains Tax Report](/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/)
  (Investor and Expert plans)\n- New Zealand: [FIF Report](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/)
  and [Traders Tax Report](/blog/calculating-taxable-gains-on-share-trading-in-new-zealand/)
  (Expert plans)\n\n## 3. Portfolio benchmarking\n\nOne of the most popular features
  in Sharesight is the ability to [benchmark your portfolio](/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/)
  against any ETF Sharesight tracks. For example, if you want to track the performance
  of your portfolio against the ASX200 index, selecting an ETF that is modelled on
  that index will help you determine the relative performance of your portfolio during
  that time period.\n\n![Benchmarking STW - Portfolio Overview - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1RN9pqxzF8tOijHpm5g1yP/6e0c65f921adfcda73a665b3329efc86/portfolio-overview-benchmarking-stw_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nSharesight
  not only lets you compare your portfolio’s performance against index-tracking ETFs,
  but any ETF within our universe. This includes a number of [‘balanced’, ‘growth’
  and ‘conservative’ ETFs](/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/).\n\n##
  4. Cash tracking\n\nUpgrading your Sharesight account also allows you to track cash
  within your Sharesight account, so you can view your complete financial position
  directly within your Sharesight portfolio. There are a few ways to track cash accounts
  within Sharesight, including via:\n\n- [Sharesight Cash Accounts](/blog/track-cash-accounts-in-sharesight/)\n-
  [Xero](/xero/) (Currently only available in Australia and New Zealand)\n- [Macquarie
  Cash Management Accounts](/blog/sharesight-integrates-macquarie-cash-management-account/)
  (Only available on [Sharesight Pro](/pro/))\n\n## 5. Diversity reporting\n\nDoes
  your investment portfolio match your [appetite for risk](/blog/does-your-investment-portfolio-match-your-appetite-for-risk/)?
  Diversification is an effective way to manage risk/return, limit exposure to any
  single asset and align your portfolio with the level of risk appropriate for your
  personal situation.\n\n![Diversity Report - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/20C4wxRtBuuCy7PDjBUpLl/86ccda331d93b60e69c8c6224b83838d/diversity-report_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n[Sharesight’s
  powerful Diversity Report](/blog/diversity-reporting-now-available/) allows you
  to examine your portfolio across the following dimensions:\n\n- Market\n- Sector
  classification\n- Industry classification\n- Investment type\n- Country\n- Do not
  group (holdings)\n- [Custom Groupings](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/) (useful
  for managed funds and ETFs, where sector and industry classifications are often
  ‘miscellaneous’ or ‘unknown’)\n\n## 6. Asset allocation reporting\n__(Available
  on Sharesight Expert plans only)__\n\nIf you thought the Diversity Report was powerful,
  the [Sharesight Contribution Analysis Report ](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/)takes
  it to the next level. The Contribution Analysis Report explains the drivers behind
  your portfolio’s performance, be they stock selection, [asset allocation](/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/),
  or exposure to certain countries, sectors, or industries.\n\n![Contribution Analysis
  Report - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4w3oPzv2nnq3SQH53g3znG/7f2e674040deead1691e07b43adc5d4b/contribution-analysis-report_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  Contribution Analysis Report allows you to undertake performance attribution at
  the individual stock level, or across various categories – including any [Custom
  Groups](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/) you’ve created. The report can be run across
  the entire history of your portfolio or a specific time period.\n\n## 7. If you
  upgrade and pay for Sharesight, it’s tax-deductible<sup>1</sup>\n\nAnother great
  way to save money when preparing your taxes is by [upgrading your Sharesight subscription](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/plans/new).
  That’s because in most cases, **Australian and New Zealand tax residents can claim
  their subscription fee when they upgrade to to a paid plan**<sup>1</sup>. And as
  a bonus, when you pre-pay for an [annual subscription](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/plans/new),
  you SAVE over 28%!\n\n######__Important Disclaimer:__ We do not provide tax advice.
  Make sure you seek appropriate tax advice before implementing the ideas in this
  post. \n\n<sup>1</sup> If you derive income from the sharemarket, your Sharesight
  subscription may be tax deductible. Check with your accountant for details.\n\n###
