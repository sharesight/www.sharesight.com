:title: How to handle the Michael Hill restructure
:url_slug: michael-hill-restructure
:content: "In June 2016, Michael Hill shareholders approved a corporate restructure
  that saw the company move to Australia and subsequently obtain a primary listing
  on the ASX, while maintaining its listing on the NZX. Michael Hill saw this as a
  logical move, given that its business was primarily conducted out of Australia and
  Australia was its biggest market.\n\nAs part of the Scheme of Arrangement, the company
  delisted from the NZX under the code MHI and listed again under MHJ. It also obtained
  approval for a primary listing on the ASX, trading under MHJ. Eligible shareholders
  received shares in the new company on a 1:1 basis, based on the number of units
  they held in the original company. These same shareholders also had the option to
  either receive ASX or NZX-listed MHJ shares.\n\n![Michael Hill restructure](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2uirBQzsVmUuKkou2mQscg/a8b2156cad39a38cd406ad733a385364/featured_michael-hill.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  an eligible shareholder, whatever your decision, [Sharesight](/) makes it easy to
  account for this restructure within your portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately Michael Hill
  has not yet released information pertaining to the cost base information, for the
  new shares. The example below will assume the new shares are entered at the closing
  market price on the first day of trading. There is no official ATO Class Ruling
  for this corporate action, however, Michael Hill have advised that eligible Australian
  shareholders can apply for roll-over relief.\n\n## How to handle the Michael Hill
  restructure if you are a resident of Australia for tax purposes\n\n1. [Sign up for
  a FREE Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup) and add your
  Michael Hill holding.\n\n2. From there, you'll need to obtain your original cost
  base of your Michael Hill (MHI.NZX) shares. To do so, run the Historical Cost Report
  in Sharesight and locate MHI.NZX. Change the date range to ‘Since Inception’ and
  note the ‘Closing Balance’ figure. This figure will be used when adding the new
  holding on either the ASX or NZX.\n    ![Michael Hill restructure - screenshot 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6snwUkciUoAOsu4QcyAu8W/28ffd24f60dd51668e71b45c530307b0/michael-hill-restructure_1.png?w=950)\n\n3.
  Click on the ‘Holdings’ tab at the top of the page. The tab should drop-down and
  you will see a button to ‘Add or Import Holdings’, which you will need to click:\n
  \   ![Michael Hill Restructure - screenshot 4](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/cpOP1QEsMgGO2MuqYw42m/476fdc57bea2f321b6dda1300021b671/michael-hill-restructure_4.png?w=950)\n
  \   This will take you to the Add Holdings page. On this page, type ‘MHJ’ in the
  search bar. A number of different listings will show, by market. You will need to
  select either MHJ.ASX or MHJ.NZX, depending on what you have received per the corporate
  action. Then enter the following information:\n\n    **Transaction Type:** Opening
  Balance  \n    **Date:** 07/07/2016 (Implementation date)  \n    **Cost Base:**
  Use the Closing Balance figure obtained from the Historical Cost Report  \n    **Quantity:**
  Same as your original holding\n    ![Michael Hill Restructure - screenshot 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7otyH7XEhGM4y8mqAOeuki/1a7b3984fed503e64e24ede3b8bbec1c/michael-hill-restructure_2.png?w=950)\n\n4.
  Once you’ve added the MHJ holding, you should be taken back to the Portfolio Overview
  page. From there, click into your original MHI holding. On the MHI Holdings page,
  click ‘Enter a new Trade or Adjustment’ and enter the following details:\n\n    **Transaction
  Type:** Cancellation  \n    **Date:** 07/07/2016  \n    **Quantity:** Same as your
  original holding  \n    **Share price:** Enter your original purchase price (or
  cost base per unit) for MHI. This way no gain is recorded on the disposal of these
  shares. If you feel that there should be a gain and that your statement (from Michael
  Hill or Computershare) advises a different price for disposal, you can use that.\n
  \   ![Michael Hill Restructure - screenshot 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/71ttL2HhHGS4M0K2uUSYIi/9dfc15122192fe031014252704b49648/michael-hill-restructure_3.png?w=950)\n
  \   \nGiven the presence of rollover relief, it is important to note that the steps
  above may not account for any applicable CGT discounts, when running the [CGT Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/),
  if you sell within the next 12 months. We suggest to add comments against these
  transactions as a reminder when running CGT reports.\n\n## How to handle the Michael
  Hill restructure if you are a resident of NZ for tax purposes\nIf you held MHI shares,
  as an NZ resident for tax, we suggest doing things a little differently to the above
  steps.\n\n1. [Sign up for a FREE Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  and add your Michael Hill holding.\n\n2. From the ‘Overview’ page, click into your
  MHI.NZX holding. On the MHI.NZX holdings page, click ‘Enter a new Trade or Adjustment’
  and enter the following information:\n\n    **Transaction Type: Sell**  \n    **Date:**
  06/07/2016  \n    **Quantity:** Same as your original holding  \n    **Share price:**
  $1.14  \n    \n    This is to remove the MHI.NZX holding. It might be a good idea
  to leave a comment against that transaction to advise why you are recording the
  ‘sell’.\n    ![Michael Hill Restructure - screenshot 5](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4snExOwqYUaqGo0wUisAK2/36f8861e74c46c81a00f11e50ce01be0/michael-hill-restructure_5.png?w=950)\n\n3.
  Once you’ve done this, you should still remain on the MHI.NZX holdings page. To
  the top-right, you will see a button ‘Add or Import Holdings’, which you will need
  to click. This will take you to the Add Holdings page, from which you will create
  a new holding for your new MHJ shares. Type ‘MHJ’ into the search bar and select
  either the ASX or NZX listed shares, depending on what you received.\n\n    **Transaction
  Type:** Buy  \n    **Date:** 07/07/2016  \n    **Quantity:** Same as your original
  holding  \n    **Price:** If you hold MHJ.NZX, you can enter the price as $1.14.\n\n
  \    If you hold the ASX-listed stock, you can use Sharesight’s given exchange rate
  of ‘0.9522’ and then a price of $1.085508, to reflect NZ$1.14, as below:\n    ![Michael
