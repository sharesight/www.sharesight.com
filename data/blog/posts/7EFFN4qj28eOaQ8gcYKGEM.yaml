:content: "Because [Sharesight](/) was built with Kiwi investors in mind from the
  [very start](/about-sharesight/), it’s an essential tool for NZ investors. This
  is especially true at tax time, when Sharesight’s comprehensive tax reports (built
  according to [IRD](https://www.ird.govt.nz) rules) save investors time, money...
  and *surprises*.\n\nRead on to learn about the 5 ways Sharesight can help you this

  Tax features within Sharesight\n\nWith all your dividends automatically captured
  and in one place, Sharesight makes tax-time a breeze. Here are a few more features
  that will save you both time and money this tax season:\n\n## #1 – New Zealand tax
  settings\nInvestors with a Sharesight portfolio tax residency set to “New Zealand”
  have a choice of the following tax settings which conform to Inland Revenue Department
  (IRD) tax reporting rules: Investor or Trader. They can also set their NZ Resident
  Withholding Tax Rate. For more information, check out our help page: *[Tax Residency
  of a Portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/)*.\n\n![Sharesight
  tax settings - NZ](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/327brGq7XWAuKmUMEG44aS/bb6f64015d690415e23d6faaa50d0a3d/screenshot_tax-settings-nz.png?w=950)\n\n##
  #2 – Taxable Income Report\nThe [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/)
  is also very useful this time of year as it breaks down all dividends over any time
  period, organised by local/overseas income and separates out withholding tax and
  imputation credits from the net dividend.\n\n![sharesight-taxable-income-report-nz-2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/RoPtiQBT04Kdgghpd1S3i/86b0bf636d8440a1a62dcb0515885391/sharesight-taxable-income-report-nz-2020.png?w=950)\n\n##
  #3 – Foreign Investment Fund Report\nKiwi investors who have certain types of overseas
  investments may have FIF income. And while the IRD has an online tool that lets
  you check if you are required to do anything under the FIF rules, if you determine
  that you do, the actual calculations can get quite complicated. The good news is
  that investors on a [Sharesight NZ Expert](/nz/pricing/) or [Sharesight NZ Pro](/nz/pro/)
  plan can run their own FIF Report in just a few clicks. This allows you to:\n\n1.
  **Determine which of your holdings are subject to FIF**\n2. **Determine whether
  you exceed the FIF threshold amount** (generally $50,000 for individuals)\n3. **Calculate
  your FIF income** under both the *Fair Dividend Rate Method* and *Comparative Value
  Method*\n\n![sharesight fif-report-2020-2 (3)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7uxomsHbjEiJjUfbyLGUKX/a153caa4689461890b1a184a21d96faf/sharesight_fif-report-2020-2__3_.png?w=950)\n\n**For
  more info, see: *[How to calculate your NZ FIF income](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/)***\n\n##
  #4 – Traders Tax Report\nAnother report built specifically for NZ investors is the
  [Traders Tax Report](/blog/calculating-taxable-gains-on-share-trading-in-new-zealand/).
  It calculates taxable gains for individuals who hold shares on revenue account (who
  are classified as “traders” by the IRD). The report allows you to carry-over losses
  from the previous period and lets you select from various sale allocation methods
  (first in first out, first in last out, minimise capital gain, or maximise capital
  gain). The report is available to anyone on a [Sharesight NZ Expert](/nz/pricing/)
  or [Sharesight NZ Pro](/nz/pro/) plan.\n\n![traders tax report - 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/64j3Bm7B5V3UJwamJDztuE/74b35894fd20c581fd8436716ae64737/sharesight-traders-tax-report-2020.png?w=950)\n\n##
  #5 – Secure portfolio sharing\nAnother essential tax-time feature is the ability
  to [share your portfolio](/blog/sharesight-portfolio-sharing-now-on-all-plans-even-free/).
  Rather than printing-out and forwarding your Sharesight tax reports, you can securely
  share portfolio access directly with your accountant and/or financial advisor. With
  all your portfolio data in one place, they’ll have everything they need to prepare
  your tax documents. Available on all Sharesight plans, portfolio sharing ensures
  everyone’s on the same page and focusing on what really matters -- not just at tax-time
  but throughout the year.\n\n> We have been using this great app for several years.

  those awful FIF calculations at tax time. The subscription is easily recovered in
