:title: 5 trends that shaped retail investing in 2020
:content: "The year 2020 was a year of change, acceleration, and as one commentator
  put it, acceleration of the acceleration, in the world of retail investing. Hereâ€™s
  my 5 biggest trends that shaped the world of retail investing last year.\n\n![Trends
  that shaped retail investing in 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4izQJlDKlg5VbJiCGRws74/a2e5b57f906e3209cdf2acb0620eb226/Trends_that_shaped_retail_investing_in_2020.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  1.The Robinhood phenomenon \n\nA record number of new investors poured money into
  the markets after the bottom in March 2020. Robinhooders - a term that was loosely
  meant to tie up all newbie retail investors. While many apparently propped up bankrupt
  companies, our own data at [Sharesight featured in the Australian Financial Review](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/robinhood-investing-goes-down-under-20200811-p55kky)
  suggested they were just picking up sensible blue chips and ETFs. \n\n## 2. Cloud
  technologies and companies \n\nFrom the time lockdowns began, there were companies
  for whom work and professional life continued as usual, uninterrupted, but online.
  Zoom calls were ubiquitous, forcing Google to improve its hangouts product, Slack
  changed its headline to \"Your New HQ\", and Microsoft teams took off a meeting
  platform. But, the \"Cloud\" had truly arrived. Of course, those older companies
  had to school themselves on the cloud, pretty quickly. An ETF that tracks all Cloud-based
  SaaS businesses is up 85.50% in this calendar year. A hypothetical $10,000 investment
  in the ETF would be worth $18,607 as of writing this article.\n\n![Cloud computing

  3. SPACs\n\nIf I'd mentioned the word SPAC last year, most of you would've stared
  blankly at me. But now, we have so many examples of SPACs and SPAC celebrities such
  as Bill Ackman. Many retail investors have participated in SPACs themselves. EV
  technologies, in particular, have been beneficiaries of this method of capital raising.\n\nTo
  read more about SPACs, here's a good [explainer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-investors-need-to-know-about-spacs/).
  I visualised the performance of a popular SPAC, Virgin Galactic below. A hypothetical
  $10,000 investment in Virgin Galactic on 1 Jan 2020, would be worth $22,000 at the
  time of writing this article.\n\n![SPACs](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1fuDiCdK6TZ0rvHfuOo1pV/c8e632066271e3f6a23f6c39cec54b62/SPACs.png?w=950)\n\n##
  4. Crypto is back \n\nThat brother-in-law who says he trades in Bitcoins and is
  worth a lot of wealth is back. After reaching some troughs in the past years, Cryptocurrencies
  are back as a genuine alternate asset class. Bitcoin gained 220% in the calendar
  year 2020.\n\n![Crypto Investing](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/01aCeG6GSQ9vrJSgxs2ZsD/ffbcbf3e277387fec2393ede69f1dc56/Crypto_Investing.png?w=950)\n\n##
  5. Tech stocks had a rocking year\n\nThis doesn't need any particular charts to
  visualise. Technology became more ubiquitous than ever before in the year. Applications
  of technology - like in Telemedicine, work from home technologies, eCommerce, food
  delivery apps, streaming services such as Netflix and Disney - the list could go
  on. This was the acceleration of the acceleration. Telemedicine, for example, accelerated
  a good 5-10 years in 2020, and is hopefully here to stay.\n\n## What trends will
  shape retail investing in 2021? \n\nAs retail investors, there's never been a more
  important time in history to be aware of the macro trends shaping our world. The
  only certainty is uncertainty as we navigate another year. \n\nStaying on top of
  your investments and keeping a good set of records with a platform like Sharesight
  are key to navigating these trends to [become a better investor in 2021](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-ways-to-become-a-better-investor-in-2021/).
