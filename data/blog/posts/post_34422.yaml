  Since December is a time to reflect on the past year, we thought we'd take the time to highlight our significant accomplishments from 2014 — and what a year it's been!

  ![2014 counter - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/z0dcwZqw8guieasOiA2Qq/3ac555aae30606180e332968f2ffa750/featured_counter-2015.jpg?w=950)

  ## New features & improved usability
  If you're a veteran [Sharesight](/) user, then you would have noticed the launch of our [improved look & feel](/blog/the-improved-sharesight-interface-new-body-same-engine/) earlier this year. From there came major [charting improvements](/blog/new-feature-charting-improvements/) and the ability to apply [custom groupings & display options](/blog/new-features-custom-groupings-display-options/). We also added a handful of powerful enhancements, including:

  - **[Broker Import](/blog/introducing-broker-import/)** — Import your entire trading history with just a few clicks.
  - **[Share Checker](/blog/how-can-i-quickly-check-share-performance-and-dividends/)** — Quickly check the performance of any share or fund.
  - **[More Brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)** — We now support Trade Confirmation Emails from over 60 brokers across AU & NZ.
  - **[Google Authentication](/blog/login-to-sharesight-with-google/)** — Signup (and login) to Sharesight using your Google account.

  ## Everything in one place
  Don't let the name deceive you — Sharesight tracks more than just shares. This year, we added support for:

  - **[mFunds](/blog/asx-mfund-now-available-on-sharesight/)** — Track ASX's unlisted managed funds.
  - **[Managed Funds](/blog/managed-funds-live-on-sharesight/)** — Monitor over 10,000 Australian & New Zealand funds.

  ## Awesome partners
  We forged new strategic partnerships and expanded upon existing ones in 2014:

  - **[CMC Markets](/blog/a-new-partnership-with-cmc-markets/)** — Premium CMC Traders now get Sharesight Investor plans at no cost.
  - **[Stockspot](/blog/announcing-new-strategic-partner-stockspot/)** — Their curated ETF model portfolios are seamlessly tracked by Sharesight.
  - **Xero** — We were absolutely thrilled to be named [Add-On Partner of the Year](/blog/sharesight-wins-xero-add-partner-year/). Additionally, we now support:
    - **[Cash Management](/blog/track-cash-fixed-interest-investments-via-xero/)** — Track your cash & fixed interest investments in Sharesight.
    - **[Xero Cashbook](/blog/xero-cashbooks-now-available-via-sharesight/)** — You can try it free for 30 days, after that it's only $15/month.

  ## New teammates
  Beyond all the product enhancements, 2014 also brought the addition of a few new teammates, including application developer Michael, marketing maven [Angela](/blog/sharesight-adds-marketing-focus/), and support & training superstar [Lulu](/blog/customers-say/).

  ## What's next?
  2015 will kick-off with a long-awaited feature launch and a major strategic partner announcement. From there, we already have a whole list of feature enhancements and partnerships to work on and roll-out. For the latest updates, stay tuned to [our Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/sharesight) and to this blog.

  ## Thanks
  **But enough about us... we also want to take this opportunity to thank you! Whether you're an individual investor, accountant or adviser:** thanks for your support and for spreading the word about us. We love hearing the many ways that Sharesight helps simplify your portfolio record-keeping and reporting, so please [keep the feedback coming](https://community.sharesight.com) next year.
