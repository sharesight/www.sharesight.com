  What is ProductRex?\n\n[ProductRex](https://www.productrex.com.au) is a free product
  research solution for financial advisers, paraplanners, administrators and anyone
  working in financial planning. ProductRex offers advisers a way to compare products
  and fees to help in the creation of their Statements of Advice and allows direct
  integrations with third party providers (such as Sharesight). With ProductRex advisers
  can: \n\n* Complete their product recommendations and research\n\n* Compare asset
  allocation and fees between products\n\n* Create easily customisable output that
  matches their SoA\n\n* Access data for 400+ super, pension and investment platforms.\n\nProductRex
  is the core of an adviser’s recommendation workflow, with the system being used
  before product recommendations have started, during the advice formulation process
  and directly before implementation of the advice.\n\n## Why has ProductRex connected
  to Sharesight?\n\nConnecting to Sharesight opens up a world of possibilities in
  terms of data aggregation for financial advisers – with access to pricing and performance
  data for over 240,000 stocks, ETFs and funds, in addition to ProductRex’s existing
  data for super, pension and various other investment platforms. This is crucial
  for financial advisers looking to ProductRex to help them prepare their SoA. \n\n\"The
  integration partnership between ProductRex and Sharesight Pro makes it easy for
  financial advisers to import share data directly from Sharesight into their scenarios,
  removing the need for manual data entry,\" says ProductRex founder Nick Topham.
  \n\n\"And for advisers new to Sharesight Pro, gaining access to reports such as
  the [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculate-investment-portfolio-diversification-sharesight/)
  or [Historical Cost Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/prepare-your-annual-accounts-with-sharesights-historical-cost-report/)
  (a useful tool for SMSF reporting) is another time-saving resource that can assist
  advisers in formulating insights and communicating them with their clients.\"\n\n![ProductRex
