  In August we announced support for 3 additional stock markets - [Singapore, Frankfurt and Johannesburg](/blog/global-markets-available-singapore-frankfurt-johannesburg/). This week, we released 2 more:

  - **Swiss Exchange (SWX)**
  - **Tokyo Exchange (TYO)**

  ![Swiss Tokyo Markets - Featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3IPY9ZuoysKqEGGYsIk2a2/407f884c57fede5b6190c150ebbd08f9/featured_tokyo-swiss.png?w=950)

  As always, [Sharesight](/) will automatically load past corporate actions including dividends and share splits for holdings from these new markets. And Sharesight leverages a daily foreign exchange feed (FX) to automatically convert the prices and valuations of your holdings from their listed market to your portfolio's base currency. It's yet another way that Sharesight alleviates traditional portfolio admin headaches.

  We added the Swiss & Tokyo stock exchanges based on client demand, so if there’s a stock exchange you’d like to see tracked on Sharesight please get in touch via our [forum](https://community.sharesight.com)!
