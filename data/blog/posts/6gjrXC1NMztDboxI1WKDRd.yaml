:title: Trade source information now in Sharesight
:content: "Sharesight makes it easy to see all of your investments in one place with
  the ability to track both historical and ongoing trades automatically from more
  than one broker. Consolidating this information in Sharesight is your key to unlocking
  powerful multi-asset performance and tax reporting\n\nTo add additional context
  to this consolidated data, Sharesight shows both the trade source and the date the
  trade was added to your Sharesight portfolio. Read on to learn how this works.\n\n![Trade
  source Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1exHv63wLHzW4W2BSs5zgV/e073c3b09343c9e7d839200feec6a96e/Trade_source_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Trade created and source information in Sharesight\n\nWith the ability to add trades
  to your Sharesight portfolio through a broker, via email, a spreadsheet or even
  manually, it can be useful to be able to identify the source of a trade at a later
  date. Identifying a trade source may be useful for identifying which brokerage account
  holds an investment you wish to sell, or identifying whether you need to consolidate
  holdings with a single broker before selling. \n\nIn Sharesight this data is shown
  when hovering over the trade information icon of the trade or adjustment in question
  (as shown in the screenshot below). This will bring up the ‘Created On’ date, the
  Source, and the Category, which we’ll explain below.\n\n![Trade Source](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3ecXZBo7mvDnIM3kwR4Nor/776fcd2abd193515f7332990e901c296/Trade_Source.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Trade ‘created on’ date\n\nThe Created on date can help identify when new trades
  were added to Sharesight. This can differ from the traded date, here’s how they
  differ:  \n\n**Created on:** This is the date the trade was added to your Sharesight
  portfolio \n\n**Traded date:** This is the date the buy or sell transaction occurred
  (and is the date used for performance and tax calculations)\n\n### Trade source
  information\n\nIn cases where a source has been identified, this will show the name
  of the source. For example, the name of your broker (Robinhood in the above screenshot),
  or if the transaction was automatically generated via a [Dividend Reinvestment Plan
  (DRP)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/),
  [share/stock split](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-investors-need-to-know-about-stock-splits/)
  (Reconstruction), or manually entered into Sharesight.\n\n### Trade category information\n\nThis
  will show whether a trade was added via Sharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/),
  the web interface, uploaded in a [spreadsheet using the Sharesight File Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/),
  the Sharesight [API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api), Company Event, or directly
  from your broker.\n\n## NOTE\n\n* Sharesight has over 250 different sources in our
  database currently\n\n* Sharesight is regularly adding new sources as they are identified
  (so they may not appear initially for new sources)\n\n* Source data will be *progressively
  backfilled* on trades where it is known (eg: Trade Confirmation Emails, company
  events), though will not appear on historical trades added via the Sharesight web
  interface, File Import, and some API transaction sources prior to this update\n\n*
  New trades added to Sharesight portfolios will display this information\n\n## Track
