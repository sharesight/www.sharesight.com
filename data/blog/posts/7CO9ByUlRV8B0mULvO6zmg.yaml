:title: How SMSF trustees can get EOFY-ready
:url_slug: how-smsf-trustees-can-get-eofy-ready
:content: "With the end of the financial year coming up, now is the time for SMSF
  trustees to take stock of their assets and get their records in order for their
  tax return. There are a number of [strict requirements](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Investing/Tax-on-income/)
  for SMSFs at tax time, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming, especially
  if you are relying on a combination of paper and digital statements, spreadsheet
  calculations and back-and-forth interactions with your accountant. Using a dedicated
  investment portfolio tracking tool like Sharesight can eliminate tedious portfolio
  admin, saving SMSF trustees time and money at tax time. To learn more about how
  trustees can get EOFY-ready by using a portfolio tracker, keep reading. \n\n![How
  SMSFs can be EOFY-ready](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3Zc1Edaf7RDJwLUQOe0IFq/f3cd91b47622b7ed3943b8d15318ebdc/How_SMSFs_can_be_EOFY-ready.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  1. Take stock of your investments\n\nOne of the most stressful elements of preparing
  an SMSF tax return is dealing with various information points from disparate sources.
  For example, if you are managing investments across mixed asset classes, multiple
  markets, currencies, share registries and even brokers, it can be a daunting task
  to retrieve all of the relevant information required to properly record your capital
  gains, dividends and franking credits. Using a spreadsheet to track your SMSF investments
  can help you stay on track, but it requires you to invest a lot of time in portfolio
  admin and manual calculations that can easily become subject to error. \n\nIf you
  want to avoid tedious portfolio admin at tax time, you’re better off using a dedicated
  portfolio tracking solution like Sharesight, which allows you to automatically track
  the impact of capital gains, dividends, brokerage fees and foreign exchange rates
  on your portfolio’s returns.  Not only is this a convenient way to track all of
  your investments in one place, but it’s also easy to share access to your portfolio
  with your accountant – allowing you to save time and money at tax time. \n\n![image

  investment income \n\nOnce you have all of your investments recorded in one place,
  it’s time to look at your SMSF’s investment income for the financial year.\n\n###
  Dividends\n\nDividends (particularly franked dividends) and distributions are an
  important source of income for many SMSF investors, so this is a good place to start.
  You will need to make sure your records are accurate and up-to-date, which means
  that even if you have recorded all of your dividend components in a spreadsheet,
  it is a good idea to compare them against your paper statements or digital statements
  from the relevant share registries. \n\nIf you use a dedicated portfolio tracker
  like Sharesight, recording your dividend income is a lot less time-consuming at
  tax time, as Sharesight automatically [tracks your dividend income](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/),
  inclusive of franking credits. This means you can verify your Sharesight records
  against your dividend statements throughout the year, rather than doing it all at
  once. SMSF trustees will also find it useful to run Sharesight’s [Taxable Income
  Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report/),
  which allows you to easily calculate the total income you have received from dividends
  and distributions throughout the financial year. \n\n### Capital gains\n\nFor SMSF
  trustees that have sold assets throughout the financial year, there may be tax implications
  for any [net capital gains](https://www.superhelp.com.au/smsfcapitalgainsrules/)
  during that time, depending whether you are in the [pension phase](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/in-detail/smsf-resources/smsf-technical/exempt-current-pension-income/?page=7)
  or the accumulation phase of your SMSF. To figure out whether you have realised
  capital gains, you will first need to find the cost price of any investments sold,
  and the price/quantity sold during the year. You can retrieve this information from
  the broker or fund manager involved in these trades.  \n\nFrom here, you can calculate
  your [capital gains tax](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-on-shares-in-australia--explained/).
  This can be tricky, as Australia allows multiple methods of calculating capital
  gains tax on shares. For example, using different sale allocation methods such as
  first-in first-out (FIFO) and last-in first-out (LIFO) can affect the cost price
  of the shares sold (and in turn the capital gain) if you purchased multiple parcels
  of shares at different prices over time. \n\nUsing a capital gains calculator like
  Sharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  can simplify this process. Built to Australian Tax Office (ATO) rules, the Capital
  Gains Tax Report allows investors to calculate the optimum sale allocation method
  for each holding sold for their individual tax position. Not only is this key in
  ensuring you are paying the lowest possible capital gains tax, but knowing your
  capital gains or losses realised during the financial year will help you optimise
  your investment strategy before the EOFY. \n\n![image 2 SMSF trustees EOFY-ready

  gains, as well as capital losses. </small>\n\n## 3. Prepare your annual accounts
  after EOFY\n\nThe income return is just one of a [number of documents](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/administering-and-reporting/record-keeping-requirements/)
  that need to be submitted on behalf of an SMSF. After the EOFY for example, SMSFs
  will need to start preparing annual financial statements, initiating an independent
  audit and lodging an annual return. All of this can mean more time chasing records
  and communicating back-and-forth with your accountant, leaving you with less time
  to spend on your investments.\n\nFor SMSF trustees who need to prepare annual accounts,
  running Sharesight’s [Historical Cost Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/prepare-your-annual-accounts-with-sharesights-historical-cost-report/)
  allows you to compare the market value and historical cost of your investment portfolio
  over any selected period. With all of your costs broken down into a range of key
  components (including your sale allocation method), this is an easy way to determine
  any unrealised capital gains or losses on your investments, saving you time when
  preparing your SMSF annual accounts. \n\n![image 3 SMSF trustees EOFY-ready Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2QfoVJry0RUuhdMlqkVt4t/60a8c4acb76c4409e8ec480611b597b9/image_3_SMSF_trustees_EOFY-ready_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n<small>

  and trust units. </small>\n\n## Don’t stress this EOFY\n\nThe EOFY does not have
  to be a nightmare for SMSF trustees. By using a dedicated portfolio tracker like
  Sharesight, you can eliminate tedious portfolio admin at the EOFY by tracking *all
  of your investments in one place*, with [automatic dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/),
  [capital gains](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/),
  [tax reporting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-australian-investors-at-tax-time/)
  and the ability to easily [share your portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/)
  with family members, your accountant or financial advisor. This means less time
  spent on tedious portfolio admin and more time spent focusing on your investment
  strategy and planning for retirement. \n\n[Sign up for a free Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
