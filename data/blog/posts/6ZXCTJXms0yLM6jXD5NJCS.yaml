:url_slug: 4-ways-to-monitor-the-health-of-your-investment-portfolio
:content: "It’s a tense time for investors worldwide. News headlines are centered
  on the US-China trade war, Brexit uncertainties, and doomsday forecasts of crashing
  markets and a global recession. And on top of all that, the month of October has
  consistently taken the crown as the [month with the most volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/octobereffect.asp),
  even when you remove the October 1929 and 1987 crashes. It’s no wonder that investors
  are on the edge of their seats.\n\nSo, how does one keep from losing cool while
  the financial markets seem to be going rabid? Easy. Monitoring how your portfolio
  has been performing overall, not just in the last month, is the best antidote to
  help you remain calm and make the best decisions. What is portfolio monitoring and
  how you use it to your advantage? Learn more with these 4 ways to monitor the health
  of your investment portfolio:\n\n## 1. Annualised Total Performance\nKeeping track
  of your annualised total performance is essential as it helps you to understand
  how your investments are doing, thus helping you to make informed (rather than impulsive)
  decisions.\n\nYou must track everything.\n\nIf I asked you what your online brokerage
  account plus superannuation plus employee shares are worth, could you give me an
  accurate figure? Oftentimes, even those investors who think they know how they’re
  doing aren’t calculating their true returns. That’s because they rely on one or
  both of the following:\n\n### a) Relying on their broker\n[Broker performance figures](/blog/4-reasons-to-stop-relying-on-your-brokers-performance-reports/)
  are often just the difference between what you paid and since the latest market
  price. These figures aren’t right because:\n\n- They don’t factor dividends (and
  dividend reinvestment plans) into your returns\n- They don’t factor brokerage fees
  or currency fluctuations into your returns\n- They don’t provide a total annualised
  return (a 20% return over five years is really only a 4% return per year)\n\n###
  b) Relying on a spreadsheet\nI’m sure you don’t need me to tell you that tracking
  your investments on a [spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  is tedious manual work that is prone to errors. Just in case you’re a spreadsheet
  lover, and that one went in one ear and out the other, let me repeat: Tracking your
  investments on a spreadsheet to monitor your portfolio's performance does not guarantee
  you are calculating your true returns.\n\nWe used to love spreadsheets, too, but
  thanks to technology we have been able to improve these old systems. Isn’t it results
  that we’re all looking for? Replace your manual and labour-intensive spreadsheet
  with [portfolio monitoring software](/) that provides:\n\n- Automatic updates\n-
  Your true performance\n- A visualisation of your portfolio\n\n![Sharesight Hero

  2. Dividend Yield\nDividends make up part of your performance returns; if you’re
  not tracking them, you’re not getting the full picture. This is especially true
  if you participate in a [dividend reinvestment plan](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  (DRP/DRIP).\n\nAmazingly, most online brokers don’t factor dividends or DRPs into
  their return figures, meaning you are not getting a complete picture of your performance
  returns.\n\nTo be a successful investor with dividends in your portfolio, you must
  understand the following:\n- How to properly track the funds you receive\n- The
  tax implications\n- The impact of dividend reinvestment\n\nSadly, [tracking dividends](/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  is labour intensive and can be a severe pain in the neck. Again, portfolio monitoring
  software is the solution to these problems as we can now automatically receive dividend
  information from the share registries, including tax information and you can enrol
  an entire holding into a dividend reinvestment plan, or reinvest specific dividends.
  Nothing is left open to error.\n\n![Dividends and DRP - Telstra 2019 - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/20yUFUqEzVb43KuTktPOq7/6583fc90e2fff59205716050a5243adf/dividends-drp_telstra-2019_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n##
  3. Asset Allocation\nReviewing the impact of your [asset allocation](/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/)
  lets you understand the true drivers of your performance, be they stock selection,
  asset allocation, or exposure to certain countries, sectors, or industries. Asset
  allocation also helps you to easily compare and contrast the winners and losers
  in your portfolio – so you can make the most of your investments.\n\n![Contribution

  is an effective way to manage risk/return, limit exposure to any single asset and
  align your portfolio with the level of risk appropriate for your situation. You
  may be in a position to take riskier growth assets, or you may need to favour an
  asset mix of cash and defensive holding.\n\nYou should review your asset allocation
  across various dimensions including: Market, Sector classification, Industry classification,
  Investment type, Country, etc.\n\n![Diversity Report 2019 - Sharesight ](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/xMySn6mdPSHPDBkhfSvAl/f7256da91dec4c5f9bbc514b2e09e3df/diversity-report-2019_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n##
  4. Benchmarking\n\nDon’t compare your portfolios just against the major indexes
  \ you see in the news. Instead, track the performance of your portfolio against
  a market-tracking index ETF which provides a true apples-to-apples comparison --
  incorporating the true costs of owning a portfolio that matches that index. \n\n[Benchmarking](/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)
  allows you to determine the relative performance of your portfolio compared to simply
  owning an ETF that takes much of the portfolio management out of your hands. You’ll
  understand whether you “beat the benchmark” or “beat the market”, and if not, it
  allows you to consider what else you could have done with your money.\n\nFor example,
  if you want to track the performance of your portfolio against your local market,
  select an ETF that is modelled on an index for that market (such as ASX: A200 for
  Australia, or TSX: XIC for Canada). If you’re an investor with an eye on portfolio
  diversification, you can even benchmark your portfolio against a model portfolio,
  such as one of [Vanguard’s diversified index ETFs](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/adviser/adv/v/diversified-ETFs.jsp):\n\n![Benchmarking

  How to track portfolio performance (and keep your portfolio healthy)\n\nGetting
  an accurate picture of the health of your investment portfolio can be tough with
  so many moving pieces to shuffle. Left to spreadsheets and third parties, you expose
  yourself to incomplete pictures of your portfolio, which can lead to poor decision
  making. Combine these four tactics, with portfolio management technology like [Sharesight](/),
  to gain ultimate control of your investment portfolio. Keep your portfolio healthy
