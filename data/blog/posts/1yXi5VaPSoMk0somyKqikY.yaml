:title: Does your investment portfolio match your appetite for risk?
:content: "Did you know that 70 percent of Australian investors seek stable, reliable,
  or guaranteed returns from their investments? In contrast to their global counterparts,
  [ASX’s 2017 Investor Study](http://www.asx.com.au/education/2017-asx-investor-study.htm)
  found Australians had high levels of risk aversion across all age groups.\n \nSurprisingly
  it was young investors (18-24yo) who were the most risk averse (80 percent seeking
  stable, reliable, or guaranteed returns), compared to 67 percent of those aged 25-59
  and just 60 percent of investors aged 60+.\n \nYet, while Australian investors are
  highly risk averse, their portfolios tend not to be well diversified, suggesting
  there exists a disconnect between investment decisions and risk appetites.\n\n![featured

  Diversification\n\nDiversification is an effective way to manage risk/return, limit
  exposure to any single asset and align your portfolio with the level of risk appropriate
  for your personal situation.\n \nSome 46 percent of Australian investors claim to
  hold a diversified portfolio, holding on average 2.7 asset classes (shares, property
  and/or cash typically). This is slightly better than the 40 percent of investors
  who identify as non-diversified, who hold an average of 1.7 asset classes.\n\n##
  How to track investment diversity using Sharesight\n \nFortunately, [Sharesight](/)
  makes it easy to track the diversity of your investments. Using [Sharesight’s diversity
  report](/blog/diversity-reporting-now-available/), you can examine your portfolio
  across the following dimensions:\n\n- Market\n- Sector Classification\n- Industry
  Classification\n- Investment type\n- Country\n- Do not group (Holdings)\n\nWant
  to group your investments according to your own asset allocation methodology, for
  analysis along a custom dimension? You can build your own Custom Groups in Sharesight
  and organise your holdings accordingly across our various portfolio reports. See
  our guide on [Asset allocation reporting in Sharesight](/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/)
  to learn how.\n\n![screenshot - info - diversity report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4XAY9nBDTa2ikIKeUGqiu0/d25862746122f85336de11e4355984fd/screenshot_info_diversity-report.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Want to be a diversification superstar?\n\nSo, you now understand the asset allocation
  within your portfolio. But what are the drivers behind your portfolio’s performance?
  Was it asset allocation, stock selections, or exposures to other factors that were
  the primary contributors to results?\n\n[Sharesight’s Expert Plan](/pricing/) lets
  you unlock the power of the [Contribution Analysis Report](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  -- giving you powerful performance attribution capabilities to identify significant
  under/over performers that may mask your portfolio’s true performance.\n\n![Screenshot
