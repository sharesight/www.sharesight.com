  making it easier than ever for UK investors to leverage Sharesight’s award-winning
  performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/) and

  The portfolio tracker provides automatically updated price and dividend information
  on [over 170,000 stocks, ETFs and mutual/managed funds](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),

  Who is Interactive Investor?\n\nFounded in 1995, [Interactive Investor](https://www.ii.co.uk/)
  is a UK-based investment firm with an online brokerage platform that charges a £9.99
  flat monthly fee. The platform gives investors access to UK stocks, ETFs and mutual
  funds, along with a range of US and international equities. Other features include
  investor education and research tools such as trading ideas, charting tools and
  technical insights. In 2016, Interactive Investor acquired the European business
  of TD Direct Investing, which Sharesight also supports. \n\n## Why you should track
  Interactive Investor trades with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your trades with Interactive
  Investor to Sharesight, you can easily [track your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  across multiple brokers and asset classes, or take advantage of Sharesight’s advanced
  performance and tax reporting designed for the needs of self-directed investors.
  \n\nUnlike the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight gives investors the true
  picture of their investment performance by taking into account the impact of brokerage
  fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and capital gains on their returns. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports
  for investors including [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/), [Contribution
  Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  and [Future Income](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/) (upcoming dividends).
  The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/),
  [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio. \n\n## How to import your Interactive Investor trades
  to Sharesight\n\nSharesight allows you to import historical and ongoing trades using
  the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) feature,
  which supports confirmations for UK and US investments through Interactive Investor
  and TD Direct Investing (Europe). You can also choose to manually import your historical
  trades by uploading a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet\n\nOne

  a [ spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1) filled
  with trades from your trading account.\n\n![image 1 II](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6TM5qfNrSZXRIqbJZaHexr/92a5d7a02b78cc8284479ecfd66b3a8d/image_1_II.png?w=950)\n\nAs
