  Designed for the needs of financial professionals, [Sharesight Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/au/financial-advisers/?utm_campaign=ais2021&=utm_source=momentum&utm_medium=native&utm_content=ifa-advertorial) is an award-winning portfolio tracker that allows financial advisers to effortlessly aggregate, manage and track clients’ investments – all in one place. The admin-made-easy, CGT and Unrealised CGT reporting alone are worth the $12 price, not to mention our connection to Xero. Want to know more about how Sharesight Pro makes life easier for financial advisers and their clients? Here are four reasons why financial advisers use Sharesight Pro.

  ## Client demand

  Our largest client base is DIY investors using the retail version of Sharesight. These users tend to be investors-in-the-know who use Sharesight because they understand the tracking and reporting shortfalls of online brokers and watchlists. Where this is relevant to financial advisers is that retail users are free to share their portfolio with anyone they like, including their financial adviser.

  Think about the admin pain most people go through when hiring an adviser. Transferring assets, paperwork, logins, custodial forms, all that tedious stuff. With Sharesight, investors can share access to their portfolio with their adviser in 10 seconds for no additional cost – giving the adviser real-time access to their portfolio, with the ability to see their holdings, plus performance data inclusive of capital gains, dividends, brokerage fees and foreign currency fluctuations.

  ## Client access

  With Sharesight Pro, financial advisers can create client logins and determine the level of access (read-only, read and write or admin). This makes it easy to invite clients to log into Sharesight and follow along with their portfolio, check trades and even run reports. After all, switched-on financial advisers know that bringing their clients into the fold is the recipe for an informed and successful client relationship.

  ## Cost-effective

  Platforms and wraps are certainly appropriate for some clients. But we don’t think portfolio admin alone should be the determining factor in choosing to put client assets on one. In the past there wasn’t a choice – an adviser couldn’t risk tracking client holdings on a spreadsheet. Unfortunately, for investors this meant paying asset management fees for a portfolio reporting service.

  Now with Sharesight, an adviser can spend $144 per year (or less) per portfolio, record unlimited trades, and not worry about assets under management or portfolio size. We don’t care if a portfolio is made up of 100 penny stocks or $100m in Berkshire Hathaway.

  When you put a portfolio on Sharesight you also have access to our ever-growing ecosystem of connected apps. We ingest trades from more than 170 global brokers and push data to apps like Xero, allowing advisers to choose from a range of industry-leading services.

  ## Complete visibility

  Ultimately, Sharesight is like a passport to your clients’ portfolio data, where you can access all the information you need from one login. It’s also possible to create multiple entities for the same client, or a family. Maybe there’s an SMSF, an online brokerage account, an old corporate super – all of this can be tracked (and consolidated) within Sharesight. What the adviser and client choose to do with the data is up to them.
