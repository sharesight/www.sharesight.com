:title: What is the role of cash in an investment portfolio?
:content: "Investing in stocks and sitting on cash might seem like mutually exclusive
  options, but they can actually be two sides of the same coin.\n\nCash is commonly
  thought of as a [defensive asset](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/glossary/d/defensive-asset)
  – a miniscule yield in return for a miniscule risk. However, cash can also turn
  into an offensive asset – dry powder you hold in reserve until you spot opportunity
  in the market.\n\nThat’s why most investors allocate at least some of their portfolio
  to cash.\n\nWarren Buffett said it best: \"Cash … is to a business as oxygen is
  to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind
  when it is absent.\" \n\n![Role of cash investment portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1Btzj3EvuX0UyfOkLKLERp/7e9c506816455c9a283a71f7732ca054/Role_of_cash_investment_portfolio.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  4 reasons investors hold cash in their investment portfolios\n\n### Cash can help
  you minimise risk (particularly as you approach retirement)\n\nThe older you are,
  the harder it is to recover from a stock market crash.\n\nThat’s why many experts
  advise you to steadily reduce your risk as you get closer to retirement – in other
  words, to steadily increase the portion of cash in your investment portfolio.\n\nIn
  the six months following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the
  [S&P 500 fell 46%, from 1,233.81 to 666.79](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history).
  For older investors allocating most or all of their portfolio in stocks, the crash
  would’ve been devastating. But for younger investors in a similar position, the
  impact would’ve been much less severe, for two reasons:\n\n●      They still had
  many years of wealth creation left ahead of them\n●      The stock market was likely
  to recover losses sooner or later (the S&P 500 is now above 3,000 points - regaining
  its losses and then some)\n\nThe value of a stock can collapse to zero – Lehmans,
  for example, peaked at $86 in 2007, before becoming worthless in 2008. Cash, though,
  will always retain its face value (minus whatever gets eroded by inflation).\n\n###
  Cash lets you take advantage of opportunities\n\nCash doesn’t just shield you from
  losses when markets slide; it also gives you a chance to react quickly and take
  advantage of potential investment opportunities.\n\nDuring corrections, as investors
  engage in panic-selling stocks, even ‘good’ companies fall in value alongside the
  broader market. That means those stocks effectively go ‘on sale’, offering a golden
  opportunity for prepared investors who hold reserves of dry powder (cash) to react
  quickly and buy stocks they see as undervalued.\n\nAgain, a little S&P 500 history
  illustrates the point.\n\nIn the [four months to 21 September 2001](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?period1=1227790800&period2=1259326800&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d),
  the index fell 26%, from 1,312.83 to 965.80. In the same period, Amazon’s share
  price dropped 54%, from $16.38 to $7.48. Of course, hindsight is a wonderful thing,
  but imagine if you recognised that Amazon had become extremely undervalued and you
  had liquid cash on hand to buy Amazon stock? Amazon’s share price is now above $1,700.\n\nWhile
  all investors love it when markets continue to move up and to the right and none
  of us *want* to see a market correction. But when the inevitable occurs, anyone
  who can buy at the bottom of the cycle is well positioned to earn strong returns
  over the next market cycle.\n\n### Cash doesn’t only mean the money sitting in your
  investment account\n\nOne of the reasons investors like cash is because it’s [liquid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp)
  – ready to use the moment it’s needed.\n\nBut this isn’t always true. That’s because
  not all cash is created equal.\n\nCash that’s sitting in an on-call account (such
  as an investment, savings or transaction account) is fully liquid and can be accessed
  quickly.\n\nCash that’s invested in a term deposit is also fully liquid, but you
  might have to wait for the term deposit to end or pay an early termination fee before
  you can reclaim your money.\n\nCash that’s invested in [money market instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market)
  (such as US Treasury Bills) has cash-like levels of safety, but technically is no
  longer cash. So you can’t get your hands on the cash until the instrument has been
  liquidated – either by on-selling it or waiting for it to expire.\n\nSo if you devote
  some of your investment portfolio to cash, you need to understand the [market liquidity
  risk](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/11/understanding-liquidity-risk.asp)
  of your different cash positions. \n\n### How much cash should you have in your
  portfolio?\n\nThe question of how much cash an investor should hold in their portfolio
  is harder to answer than it sounds.\n\nSome experts recommend as little as 2%; others
  as much or more than 20% (especially if you include bonds/fixed interest). Where
  you sit on that spectrum will be influenced by three things:\n\n●      Your emergency
  savings buffer\n●      Your age\n●      Where we are in the cycle\n\n\nTo begin
  with, it’s important to have ‘emergency cash’. Many experts recommend that you keep
  enough cash to cover anywhere from three to six months of day-to-day expenses, so
  you can cope if you lose your job or cop a sudden bill. This emergency money may
  or may not be inside your investment portfolio, which is why it affects how much
  cash your portfolio should contain. \n\nYour age is also relevant. As mentioned
  above, many experts recommend that you steadily increase your cash holdings as you
  approach retirement, as a form of risk management. Sometimes investors use what
  is called the [100 minus your age rule](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/062714/100-minus-your-age-outdated.asp)
  as a rule of thumb to calculate their relative equity/fixed interest+cash portfolio
  allocations - although with increasing life expectancy and [ever lower returns expected
  in fixed interest investments](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-maximise-returns-in-a-low-return-world/)
  this rule is [increasingly questioned](https://www.thebalance.com/100-minus-age-allocation-approach-puts-retirees-at-risk-2388296).\n\nFinally,
  it’s important to consider where we are in the market cycle. If you believe the
  market expansion has a long way to run and there is a low risk of a significant
  correction, you might want to allocate less to cash; if you think markets are nearing
  the end of a growth cycle and increasingly risky, you might want to hold more.\n\n##
