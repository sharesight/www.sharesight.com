:title: How to calculate cost base per share
:url_slug: at-a-glance-cost-base-per-share
:content: "The cost base of an investment is one of the key metrics an investor needs
  to know when preparing their tax return. While it is possible to manually calculate
  the cost base of your investments, this quickly becomes tedious and subject to error,
  especially for large portfolios with a lot of trades and dividend-paying stocks.
  To learn more about cost base per share, how it’s calculated and how you can automatically
  track it using Sharesight, keep reading. \n\n![How to calculate cost base per share](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/IiqUN1q4I55EIQrvzUJC8/3c9eaf100d51b78e330f8d58e13c8c3e/How_to_calculate_cost_base_per_share.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is cost base per share?\n\nThe [cost base](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp)
  of an investment is its original value for tax purposes – typically the value of
  the purchase price adjusted for corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends
  and return of capital distributions. It can also include any fees that were involved
  in the purchase. Cost base is used to determine an investment’s capital gain, which
  is calculated based on the difference between the investment’s cost base and the
  current market value. It is important to know the cost base (and capital gain) of
  your stocks, especially if you have sold shares, as this can have tax implications.
  The cost base per share is simply an investment’s cost base divided by the number
  of shares.\n\n## How is cost base per share calculated?\n\nThere are different ways
  to calculate cost base per share depending on the corporate action involved. To
  calculate cost base per share for a company that has undergone a stock split, consider
  the following example:\n\nYou hold 500 shares in the company, which were purchased
  at a price of $10/share. The company undergoes a 2:1 stock split. To figure out
  your cost base per share, you will need to divide the original value of the investment
  ($5,000) by the new number of shares you hold post-split (1,000) to get a value
  of $5, compared to your previous cost base per share of $10. You could also divide
  your original cost base per share ($10) by the split factor of 2:1, which would
  give you the same result. \n\nThis is just one example, however in most cases you
  will need to undertake further calculations if you want to adjust your cost base
  for dividends and distributions or for additional share parcel purchases or sales,
  for instance. If you have a large portfolio or a lot of dividend-paying stocks,
  this can become tedious and subject to error. \n\n### View cost base per share at
