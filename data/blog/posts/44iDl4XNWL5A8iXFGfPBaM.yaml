:title: What is a capital call transaction?
:content: "Many of our clients are sophisticated and experienced investors who use
  Sharesight to get a consolidated view across multi-asset class portfolios. Sharesight
  supports tracking a wide range of asset classes, many with prices updated automatically.
  In this post we’ll cover how to track what is known as a *capital call* transaction
  -- a type of transaction that is commonly encountered in private equity investments.\n\n![capital

  Private equity capital calls\n\nA [\"capital call\" or “draw down”](https://www.securedocs.com/blog/private-equity-what-is-a-capital-call)
  transaction occurs in the context of private equity and venture capital investments.
  It is the legal term for the scenario where an investment firm asks for the capital
  already committed to it by an investor to provide the funds -- usually when an investment
  deal is due to close.\n\nFor example, an investor might commit $500,000 into a private
  equity fund. This is called [capital commitment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-commitment.asp).
  But she may pay only $100,000 on signing the agreement. A certain period of time
  later, the fund may issue a capital call for the remaining $400,000 over a period
  of years, so the investor can meet her commitments. This means that the cost base
  of the investment goes up in line with the capital calls.\n\n## Returns through
  return of capital, dividends and interest payments\n\nTo illustrate this, consider
  the following example of an investor (let’s call him Harry) who has committed $500,000
  to a private equity fund called PE fund 1. In his Sharesight portfolio, Harry adds
  this holding as a [custom investment](https://help.sharesight.com/au/unquoted-instruments/)
  under the Investment type ‘Ordinary Shares’ for the original amount paid into the
  fund of $100,000. \n\nHarry then uses [Sharesight’s custom groups feature](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  to create his own group called \"Private Equity\" into which he has grouped this
  investment to help track it alongside any other private equity investments. \n\nThereafter,
  the fund sends a capital call notice to Harry for another $100,000. He records this
  in Sharesight as a \"capital call\" transaction by adding a trade or adjustment
  to the holding and selecting the appropriate transaction type per the screenshot
  below\n\n![Capital Call](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1DqynzpNsrEePgeYbUrVro/7acab8a0ce3fa186b3b6a84ba1385f6a/Capital_Call.png?w=950)
  \n\nWhenever there is a return of capital by the fund, this can be recorded using
  the same process and instead selecting \"return of capital\" as the transaction
  type.\n\n## Track multi-asset class portfolios in Sharesight\n\nBy bringing all
  his investments into Sharesight, Harry is able to see the return from the private
  equity fund, in the same manner as a publicly listed stock. This way, he is able
  to compare the total annualised return in the same dimension and manner as the rest
  of his portfolio.\n\nThe capital call and [return of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnofcapital.asp)
  transactions represent the capital movements in and out of the fund, while the dividends
  are paid as [franked or unfranked amounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/)
  depending on where the underlying revenue was generated. \n\nThe cost base of the
  holding is increased by the capital call value. Over time the fund is expected to
  return money (ie: make distributions) in the form of capital or [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/).
  These have different tax implications depending on the fund and tax implications
  of the individual investor. \n\n![Tracking private equity investments](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1vniAtV4VvK4ZZiIzouoT6/b4342718ab524ca8aa7574504ffc777f/Tracking_private_equity_investments.png?w=950)\n\n##
