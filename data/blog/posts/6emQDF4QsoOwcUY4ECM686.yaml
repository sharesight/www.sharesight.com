:title: Vice or virtue - what's the better investment?
:content: "Thematic investing has outlived its originators.\n\nThe world’s oldest
  mutual fund, the Putnam Investors Fund, takes a “go anywhere approach” and its mantra
  is “seeking great companies for investors since 1925.” The theme being great companies
  as opposed to terrible ones.\n\nToday thematic investing is sexier. Themes range
  from specific tech sectors to bets against a particular industry. Thematic strategies
  go hand-in-hand with ETFs. Investors can trade in and out of them on public markets.
  One of our partners, [Macrovue](/blog/announcing-a-new-partner--macrovue/), curates
  Vues -- themes you can deploy to suit your preferences.\n\n### That a manager tracks
  a particular theme is enough to gather assets. \n\nOne of my all time favourites
  is the [Vice Fund](http://www.usamutuals.com/) (MUTF:VICEX). The folks at Vice run
  a strategy “across industries with significant barriers to entry including tobacco,
  alcoholic beverages, gaming, defense, and aerospace industries.”\n\nThat innocuous
  mission statement betrays the fact that their logo is a martini, a bullseye, a pair
  of tumbling dice, and a lit cigarette. I’m sure the Trump administration is considering
  Vice as their default pension option.\n\n![featured - Angels and Demons](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2luPlEMQDy8okWIo6QaMGE/fab119b652cfcb0f4921cc94467f9c60/featured_angels-demons.png?w=950)\n\nHaving
  been a Vice enthusiast for some time, I began to wonder if Vice had an opposite.
  If Vice is the devil on one shoulder could there be an angel on the other?\n\nSocially
  responsible investing (SRI) has grown in popularity, becoming almost synonymous
  with eco-friendly investing. SRI has been around since the 1990s, mostly with a
  focus on civil rights, poverty, and even better rights for investors.\n\nBut most
  mainstream SRI funds don’t offer an inverse to the Vice Fund. If vice is defined
  as immoral or wicked behaviour, the inverse would be a fund that encourages moral
  and virtuous behaviour.\n\n### What righteous earthy body has enough money to run
  a fund like that?\n\nThe Christians. I began researching religious-based mutual
  funds. Turns out there are a lot of them -- Catholic funds, Lutheran funds, evangelical
  options -- a flavour for every denomination.\n\nAmongst the largest by funds under
  management and with a name to rival the Vice Fund is the [Ave Maria Rising Dividend
  Fund](https://avemariafunds.com/fund-family/avedx.html) (MUTF:AVEDX). Talk about
  an awesome marketing visual -- dividends rising from the grave, safely collected
  by George Schwartz and Richard Platte, the fund’s managers in suburban Detroit.\n\nAve
  Maria Rising Dividend seeks dividend income and growth through companies that “do
  not violate the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.” Not surprisingly their
  logo features a Gothic-style church window, an open bible and a cross.\n\n![logos

  Two funds on opposite ends of the moral spectrum. What happens when we compare their
  portfolios?\n\nWhether you prefer the crusaders of virtue or princes of darkness,
  both options are steeped in conviction -- something you want in such a fund manager.
  Vice owns just 44 stocks compared to Ave Maria’s 38. The world offers more opportunities
  to sin I suppose.\n\nObviously investors should expect completely distinct portfolios
  right?\n\nNope. Digging through their latest disclosure documents shows two companies
  owned by both funds. In such concentrated portfolios with such opposite mandates
  that’s a huge surprise. What type of company could possibly pass a screening for
  both vice and virtue?\n\nLibations!\n\nVice and Ave Maria both own shares in alcohol
  giants Diageo and Brown-Forman. Each of the four positions represent over 1% of
  their total portfolios, which means that Vice and Ave Maria have almost 5% of client
  money copulating.\n\nSurprisingly Ave Maria takes a particular shine to energy (Exxon,
  Schlumberger, and Halliburton) whereas Vice... actually Vice does nothing surprising.
  Every company in their portfolio sells a product that kills you (Philip Morris),
  kills others (Raytheon), takes your money (Crown Casinos), or starts wars (Lockheed
  Martin).\n\nHere are the top 10 holdings in each portfolio:\n\n### The Vice Fund\n\n|
  Company     | Type     |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| Altria       | Cigarettes
  \      |\n| American Outdoor Brands       | Guns       |\n| Heineken       | Alcohol

  Parts Distributor       |\n| Zimmer Biomet       | Knee Replacements       |\n\n###
  Which fund passes the ultimate judgement -- performance?\n\nAccording to Morningstar,
  $10,000 invested in Ave Maria Rising Dividend would have netted you $2,600 more
  than the Vice Fund over the last 10 years. That’s redeeming.\n\nWhile the minimum
  investment amounts are both modest, the price to sin is 61% higher than to give
  to the collection plate. This expense ratio difference explains a good chunk of
  the performance gap.\n\n### But how to measure each manager’s true beliefs?\n\nI
  wanted to measure the performance of each manager’s highest conviction stock picks.
  To determine, I built each portfolio in [Sharesight](/), but with a twist:\n\n-
  First, I bought each manager’s top five current holdings by portfolio weight, but
  invested the current amount of shares held back on the date they first bought the
  company.\n- Second, I bought the five longest held positions in each portfolio,
  again investing the current position held back on the day they first bought the
  stock.\n\nYes, this approach wreaks of hindsight, but it’s a fun way to pit the
  angels against the demons.\n\n### How did the managers fare based on their conviction
  picks?\n\nSince the first purchase in 2005, the “Angels” portfolio (Ave Maria Rising
  Dividend) returned 6.58% annualised, with a 3.05% annualised dividend income.\n\n![screenshot

  the first purchase in 2003, the “Demons” portfolio (Vice Fund) returned 32.31% annualised,
  with a 7.48% annualised dividend income:\n\n![screenshot - Angels and Demons 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3c2ZnWQmLC4mAwMiIUUcaa/9f8f62a5f324c86c0080adc943ec8fef/screenshot_angels-demons-2.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  be fair the Vice Fund has been running for longer (it’s also half the size). Here’s
  a look at how each fund’s conviction picks compare over the same time periods:\n\n|
  &nbsp; | 1 Year | 3 Year | 5 Year | 7 Year | 10 Year |\n| --- | --- | --- | ---
  | --- | --- |\n| The Vice Fund            | 17.78% | 22.02% | 25.86% | 29.83% |
  24.97%|\n| Ave Maria Rising Dividend| 5.98%  | 2.23%  | 6.68%  | 6.16%  | 5.51%
  |\n| S&P 500 (SPY)            | 14.69% | 11.99% | 16.97% | 16.52% | 8.30% |\n\n<small><i>Performance
  figures annualised</i></small>\n\n### But what explains those returns?\n\nI ran
  a [contribution analysis report](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  in Sharesight to further breakdown Vice’s return profile, with [custom groups](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/)
  based on how I’d classify these companies.\n\nUnlike most mortal souls, their commitment
  to smoking has really kept them going.\n\n64% of the Vice Fund’s 14 year return
  is attributable to their investment in tobacco companies. This explains why even
  in 2017 British American Tobacco announced plans to buy Reynolds for $49B. Runner
  up is their investment in “War,” which explains 26% of their total return.\n\n![screenshot
  - Angels and Demons 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4Kh3F2sb1KKEK8CY6oieac/7ecbdb39d50eb1a55528e56c3c981731/screenshot_angels-demons-3.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  for Ave Maria, their return composition is diversified with Emerson Electric and
  Cisco Systems leading the way. However, even though their portfolio may pass a “Catholic
  screen,” I was less convinced of their purity.\n\nBased on what I learned in Sunday
  School, I built another custom group that tags their holdings as “Saints,” “Sinners,”
  and “Purgatory” for those in between -- these companies may have good intentions,
  but their products seem to wind up in the hands of companies in the Vice portfolio.\n\nTurns
  out those stranded in Purgatory are the biggest driver of returns, delivering 64%
  of the fund’s return over 12 years, followed by the Sinners’ 32%.\n\nThe Saints
  returned only 4%.\n\nTo Ave Maria’s credit, Emerson Electric, one of their longest
  held and largest positions has contributed almost 30% to their total return. Unfortunately,
  Emerson is stuck in Purgatory -- their products are used in nuclear submarines and
  deep sea oil rigs.\n\n![screenshot - Angels and Demons 4](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3dQ7MbJgGAEgC6QGoUEGWA/c9ae59126453cce45df8dcc2d35f7b14/screenshot_angels-demons-4.png?w=950)\n\nThematic
  investing is a useful tactic, but it’s wise to know what you’re actually buying
  and at what price. Ave Maria Rising Dividend investors should be thrilled with the
  fund’s low price, but might take issue with some of their stock picks. The Vice
  Fund certainly delivers on its name, but investors pay a high price to sin.\n\n###
