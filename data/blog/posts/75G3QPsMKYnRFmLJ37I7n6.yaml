  Who is ANZ Share Investing?\n\n[ANZ Share Investing](https://www.anz.com.au/personal/investing-super/online-share-investing/)
  is an online brokerage platform owned by [ANZ Banking Group](https://www.anz.com.au/personal/),
  an Australian multinational banking and financial services company founded in 1951.
  The platform gives investors access to a range of Australian stocks, ETFs and managed
  funds with brokerage fees starting from $19.95. Investors can also purchase stocks
  in a variety of global markets such as the New York (NYSE), London Stock (LSE),
  Tokyo (TSE) and Toronto (TSX) stock exchanges, which are [supported by Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  Other features include market news and research, advanced charting tools and SMSF
  connectivity. \n\n## Why you should import your ANZ trades to Sharesight\n\nBy importing
  your trades with ANZ Share Investing to Sharesight, you can easily [track your investment
  performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  across multiple brokers and asset classes, or take advantage of Sharesight’s advanced
  performance and tax reporting designed for the needs of Australian investors. \n\nUnlike
  the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight gives investors the true picture of
  their investment performance by taking into account the impact of brokerage fees,
  [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and [capital gains](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  on their returns. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports for investors
  including [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/), [Portfolio
  Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/), [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  and [Future Income](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/) (upcoming dividends).
  The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/),
  [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio. \n\n## How to import your ANZ trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to easily import your trading history by either connecting directly to
  your ANZ Share Investing account or uploading a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  of trades. You can also automatically import ongoing trades through the [Trade Confirmation
  Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) feature. Keep reading to learn
  more.\n\n## Add historical trades through your ANZ account\n\nThe easiest way to
  build your Sharesight portfolio is to [directly import trades from your ANZ Share
  Investing account to Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/import-anz-share-investing/).
  This populates your Sharesight portfolio with historical buy and sell trades straight
  from your trading account. \n\n![image 1 ANZ](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/53wfQgoX19hZOElH4rylVr/0dea8ba3638c8237b88e4ea6042b8b0a/image_1_ANZ.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  do this, you will need to enter your ANZ Share Trading login details and choose
  the trading details you wish to import into Sharesight. Once you have imported your
  historical trades into Sharesight, you can then automatically keep your portfolio
  up to date by importing ongoing trades using the Trade Confirmation Emails feature,
