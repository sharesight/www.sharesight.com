:title: Tax loss selling made easy
:content: "###### NOTE: There is a newer version of this article. See [*Tax loss selling
  for Australian investors*](/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/) for

  only and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial
  advice and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or
  accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nAs we come to the
  end of the financial year (in Australia, at least), investors’ thoughts inevitably
  turn to tax. In particular, in a year like this one where you have probably seen
  some decent rises in your portfolio it can be a good time to harvest some gains
  while minimising your tax.\n\n![featured - coins - chess](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6yEftLXFZKIk2iWsSq6KmK/440d8fa362679982f3969ea6448606d8/featured_coins-chess.jpg?w=950)\n
  \nAs Marcus Padley put it in Cuffelinks (now Firstlinks) back in 2015:\n \n> We
  are coming into the end of the financial year. This is a good time to assess your
  capital gains tax situation for the year so far and work out if you have a net capital
  gain from stocks sold. If so, you should also be looking through the portfolio for
  any stocks with losses attached that you could sell and crystallise a loss to offset
  paying any tax on the gains.<br><br>\nYou know the stocks, those crappy little holdings
  you didn’t sell when it was obvious you should sell. Those stocks that you shut
  your eyes to and hoped against hope they would rebound miraculously... but they
  kept falling. Those stocks. Those small illiquid cock-ups that shout \"Idiot, idiot!\"
  every time you see them in your 'portfolio'. All those short term trades that became
  long term 'investments'. Yes them... the crap.<br> <cite>Marcus Padley, <a href=\"https://www.firstlinks.com.au/making-tax-loss-selling/?utm_source=sharesight\">Making
  the most of tax loss selling</a></cite>\n\nSo how do you implement this process?
  By tax loss selling (also known as \"tax harvesting\") assets with capital losses
  in order to lower or eliminate the capital gains realised by other investments.
  And in [Sharesight](/) it’s easy to do, thanks to the [Unrealised CGT Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/unrealised_cgt_report/).
  This report shows the CGT position for all your holdings which are not yet sold.
  It breaks the gains into short and long term and also shows your losses as well.\n
  \nLet’s take a hypothetical example. Suppose you were prescient enough to buy Xero
  (ASX: XRO) back in 2010 when it was selling at $1.72 and now want to cash in your
  tremendous gain as it now sells around $25. You are sitting on a profit of $130,000.
  You are also sitting on a big loss of $60,000 in formerly high-flying Slater and
  Gordon (ASX: SGH). You have been sitting on it in the hope that it will some day
  bounce back. Well if you sell both stocks in the same year you will be able to offset
  about half the gain in your Xero stock with the SGH sale. That may soften the blow
  of the loss -- and encourage you to move on to new investing horizons!\n\n![screenshot

  a good idea to run the report throughout the year, not just at the end, in order
  to see where you are and to start thinking about opportunities to pair off gains
  and losses throughout the year.\n\n### One note of caution\n\nLet’s say that despite
  the hammering you have taken on SGH you think it is now super cheap and poised for
  a return to greatness. You sell SGH to realise the loss and then buy it back again
  to position for the rebound. This is known as a \"Wash Sale\" and the ATO takes
  a very dim view of this. They will disallow the loss if the sole intention of the
  sale was to minimise tax. So if you are going to sell, make sure you really mean
  it. If you still believe in that stock then choose a different “loser” to sell to
  offset your gain! Here is a [recent article on the topic](https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/ato-gets-tougher-on-tax-loss-share-sales/news-story/9b726d2863fb19f799ea9482bef9c638).\n\n###
  Save even more by claiming your subscription\n \nWhile the Unrealised CGT Report
  is available exclusively to upgraded Sharesight plan holders, in most cases, Australian
  tax residents can claim next year’s subscription fee on this year’s tax return by
  upgrading to a [paid plan](/pricing/) before 30 June<sup>1</sup>. And as a bonus,
  when you pre-pay for an annual subscription, you get 1 month free.\n\n### FURTHER
