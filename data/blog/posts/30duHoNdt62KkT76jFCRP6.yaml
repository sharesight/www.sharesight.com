:content: "###### MILESTONE UPDATE: As of the 25th of October 2021 we've reached another
  incredile milestone, with __more than 300,000 global investors now tracking their
  portfolios in Sharesight__. Here's to empowering *even more investors* around the
  world! \n\nWe are excited to announce that there are now more than **250,000 empowered
  investors** in **106 countries** tracking over **3 million holdings** with Sharesight.
  \n\nMore than just another milestone, this is part of an important growth journey
  for Sharesight. After bootstrapping our New Zealand-based business to 100,000 users,
  we were able to [double our user base](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/over-200000-global-investors-track-their-portfolios-on-sharesight/)
  in the next 18 months, and are continuing to grow on this trajectory as more investors
  around the world discover the benefits of using a portfolio tracker to get the full
  picture of their performance. \n\n![250k global investors using Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1Phc6ucg60LD2h3IIu48H2/0165250e3004f94cf17ed3771a8b900e/250k_global_investors_using_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\nTo
  celebrate this achievement, let’s take a look at the history behind Sharesight,
  along with some of our newest features designed to help investors track all of their
  global investments in one place. \n\n## A brief history of Sharesight\n\nBorn from
  a desire to make it easier for self-directed investors to track their investments,
  Sharesight was first established in New Zealand in 2007. We have come a long way
  since then, from achieving our first paying user in 2008, to our global launch in
  2015 and our latest milestone of over 250,000 global users in more than 100 countries.
  \n\n![Sharesight 250k featured image](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/37mWFdcgUGFmQEoe1u0hAE/25d1e5aa5bae02a851e2e8dcdb5a26e9/Sharesight_250k_featured_image.png?w=950)\n\n\"Expanding
  our global user base has been an important priority for Sharesight since launching
  internationally in 2015. With the recent influx of new investors in markets worldwide,
  we took this as an opportunity to expand our product and our team, making it easier
  than ever for global investors to access Sharesight’s award-winning performance,
  dividend tracking and tax reporting features,\" says Sharesight CEO, Doug Morris.
  \n\n\"We have welcomed many new users from the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore
  and the UK in particular, and we are excited to keep building out our product to
  bring advanced performance tracking to investors around the world.\"\n\n## What’s
  new at Sharesight\n\nAt Sharesight, we are always working on new features and further
  enhancements to improve user experience and make Sharesight accessible to global
  investors. \n\nOne of the most important factors in all of this is the ability to
  track over **170,000 stocks, ETFs and funds** in more than **[36 leading global
  markets](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)**,
  plus the ability to automatically import trades from **[201 international brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/)**
  – a number that has grown from 178 just four months ago. \n\nIn other news, we have
  also released our [Multi-Currency Valuation Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/),
  which allows investors to see the value of their investments denominated in any
  of the **[67 currencies](https://oxr.readme.io/docs/supported-currencies)** that
  Sharesight supports, including leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
  This is a useful feature for expats and global investors who want to see their investments
  in the currency they \"think\" in, not just the currency of their tax residency.
  \n\n\"Investors are shifting their portfolios internationally more than ever. The
  response to the Multi-Currency Valuation Report has been overwhelmingly positive,
  and we are pleased to see that so many investors are making use of this feature.
  Similarly, we are always working to support new brokers and make it easier for investors
  to track their shares with Sharesight, which has led us to add support for 23 additional
  brokers since the beginning of the year,\" says Doug. \n\n\"We also have some very
  exciting updates planned for 2021 that will make Sharesight an even more powerful
  solution for global investors, so be sure to watch this space to find out more.\"\n\n##
  Looking forward to the next 250,000 \n\nReaching more than 250,000 global users
  is an important milestone for us at Sharesight, and we would like to thank all of
  our loyal users for helping us reach this goal. As an independent and trusted portfolio
  tracking software, it is our goal to empower our users to become better investors,
  and we look forward to welcoming new users from around the world. \n\nWhy track
