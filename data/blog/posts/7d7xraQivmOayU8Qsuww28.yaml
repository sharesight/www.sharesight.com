:title: Run your tax reports before ATO’s October 31 deadline
:content: |-
  The deadline for Australians lodging their own tax return for the 2016-2017 financial year is October 31. If you’re like me, you’ll be spending the weekend getting your tax affairs in order to file in time. But the good news is that using [Sharesight](/) to track your investments makes tax time a breeze. Here’s how:

  ![featured - tax time](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2jlHUDonLeWoOSwQQQ0WOq/7cfba19474b524287821b4ee3eeaedc0/featured_tax-time.jpg?w=950)

  ## Comprehensive tax reports

  With dividends and franking credits automatically accounted for, Sharesight **saves you the hours normally spent tracking down investing-related data and paperwork**. It also **saves you potentially thousands of dollars in accounting fees** (including hundreds spent on CGT reports alone) by letting you running your own tax reports:

  ### 1. Capital Gains Tax

  Sharesight’s [Australian Capital Gains Tax Report](/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/) calculates capital gains made on shares as per ATO rules. The report is based on the ‘discount method’ for shares that were held for more than 1 year and the ‘other method’ for shares held for less than 1 year. It breaks down short and long term capital gains and capital losses, and allows you to customise your discount rate and sale allocation method. It even lets you “carry forward” any losses from the previous reporting period:

  > For $25 per month I was given back about 15 hours of my life usually devoted to manually calculating CGT.<br> <cite>Stephen Colman, Sharesight customer</cite>

  ### 2. Taxable Income

  The [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/) breaks down all dividend and franking credits over any time period, and organises them by local/overseas income, as well as non-trust/trust income (such as ETFs):

  ### 3. Historical Cost

  The [Historical Cost Report](https://help.sharesight.com/historical_cost_report/) displays opening and closing balances at cost price. It also includes a ‘market value’ column to allow a quick comparison between cost price and market value at the end of the chosen period:

  ## Secure portfolio sharing

  Whether you’re filing before the October 31 deadline (or at [a later date depending on your situation](https://www.ato.gov.au/Tax-professionals/Prepare-and-lodge/Tax-agent-lodgment-program/Tax-returns-by-client-type/Individuals-and-trusts/)), if you’re working with an accountant, you’ll want to [share secure portfolio access](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/) with them. Available exclusively to upgraded subscribers, sharing your portfolio allows you to:

  - **Save time** by no longer having to gather paperwork for your financial professional(s).
