:url_slug: track-stocks-kosdaq-sharesight
:content: "With Sharesight, investors can easily track more than 1,400 stocks and
  ETFs on the KOSDAQ exchange, with daily price and performance updates. This is in
  addition to Sharesight’s support for key Asian markets such as the Korea Exchange
  (KRX), [Shanghai Stock Exchange](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-asian-european-stock-exchanges-sharesight/)
  (SHG) and [Tokyo Stock Exchange](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-the-swiss-tokyo-stock-exchanges/)
  (TYO), plus over [40 other global markets](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)
  including leading US exchanges. Sharesight’s extensive market support allows investors
  from around the world to track *all their investments in one place*, while providing
  them with powerful performance reports, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features.\n\n![Track stocks on KOSDAQ exchange](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6QITqlZRc5hraKl5LupxJk/549b3d704bce2c8b9bd5530b49e05ee7/Track_stocks_on_KOSDAQ_exchange.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is the KOSDAQ exchange?\n\nEstablished in 1996, the [KOSDAQ](https://global.krx.co.kr/main/main.jsp)
  (Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) is a South Korean electronic stock
  market that operates as the SME Market Division of the KRX. The stock exchange lists
  over 1,000 stocks, ETFs, bonds and REITs, including several large-cap companies.
  It is sometimes referred to as the \"Korean Nasdaq\", as it was originally benchmarked
  from the Nasdaq, and has a similar focus on innovative tech-driven companies. \n\n##
  Why investors should track their investments on the KOSDAQ exchange with Sharesight\n\nWith
  Sharesight, investors can easily [track the price and performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  of stocks listed on the KOSDAQ exchange alongside investments across multiple global
  markets, brokers and asset classes. By consolidating all of their investments in
  Sharesight, investors gain a portfolio-wide view of their investment performance,
  benefitting from daily price updates for the KOSDAQ, plus advanced reporting designed
  for the needs of self-directed investors. In addition, Sharesight’s [annualised
  performance calculation methodology](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  gives investors the complete picture of their portfolio returns by calculating the
  impact of capital gains, brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and [foreign exchange rates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  on performance.\n\n### Track dividend income from KOSDAQ stocks\n\nUnlike other
  portfolio trackers, Sharesight automatically [tracks dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  and includes this information when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make an important contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the value of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more than
  just capital gains in its performance calculations.\n\n![JLS stock holding example

  return. </small>\n\n### Run powerful performance reports built for investors\n\nFor
  investors who want a more detailed breakdown of their portfolio’s performance, Sharesight
  offers a range of powerful reports including:\n\n* [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/):
  Calculate your total portfolio returns over any selected period.\n\n* [Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/):
  Discover how the assets in your portfolio are diversified across different investment
  sectors, investment types, countries and markets.\n\n* [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/):
  Measure the impact of your holdings and asset allocations on your overall portfolio
  performance.\n\n* [Future Income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/):
  View announced dividends and interest payments expected for investments in your
  portfolio.\n\n* [Multi-Currency Valuation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/):
  See the value of your holdings denominated in the currency of your choice. \n\n*
  [Multi-Period Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/multi-period-report/): Compare
  your portfolio returns over different time frames to see the impact of time on your
  performance. \n\n### Calculate the impact of KOSDAQ investments on your portfolio’s
  returns\n\nIn the screenshot below, you can see the [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  (sorted by market) being used to assess the ‘weight’ of various markets in a US
  investor’s portfolio. This would be particularly useful for an investor looking
  to compare the relative contribution of their KOSDAQ investments to the total return
  on their portfolio, for instance.\n\nIn this example, the KOSDAQ is the most significant
  contributor to the portfolio’s value, constituting 47.42% and $71,494,24, followed
  by the NYSE at 21.85% and $32,940.33. The report also includes a detailed breakdown
  of each individual holding’s returns, classified by market.\n\n![Contribution analysis
