  Who is FinecoBank?\n\nEstablished in 1999, [FinecoBank](https://finecobank.com/en/online/)
  is an Italian-based bank specialising in online brokerage, which also provides trading
  services for [UK customers](https://finecobank.co.uk/public/). The platform allows
  investors to trade in stocks and ETFs in key European markets, including the [London
  Stock Exchange](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-on-the-london-stock-exchange-lse-with-sharesight/)
  (LSE), as well as North American markets such as the [Nasdaq](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-on-the-nasdaq-with-sharesight/),
  [New York](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-the-new-york-stock-exchange-nyse-with-sharesight/)
  (NYSE) and Toronto (TSX) stock exchanges, which [Sharesight also supports](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  Other key features include a digital learning centre with access to live events,
  webinars and educational videos for investors and traders.\n\n## Why you should
  track FinecoBank trades with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your FinecoBank trades to
  Sharesight, you can easily [track your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  across different brokers, asset classes and markets, or take advantage of Sharesight’s
  advanced performance and tax reporting designed for the needs of self-directed investors.\n\nUnlike
  the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight takes into account the impact of capital
  gains, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/), brokerage fees
  and currency fluctuations when calculating returns – giving investors the full picture
  of their portfolio’s performance. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports
  for investors including [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/),
  [Multi-Currency Valuation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/)
  and [Future Income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/)
  (upcoming dividends). The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/),
  [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio.\n\n## How to import your FinecoBank trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to import your historical and ongoing FinecoBank trades in UK stocks
  and ETFs through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  feature, or you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading
  a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  For more information, keep reading.\n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails
  feature for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n### Help us add support for FinecoBank Italy\n\nSharesight

  add support for Italian trade confirmations, leave us a message in the chat interface
