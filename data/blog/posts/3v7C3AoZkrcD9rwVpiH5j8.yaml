:title: Why one accountant switched from Excel to Sharesight Pro
:url_slug: why-accountant-switched-excel-sharesight-pro
:content: "In this Q&A, we talk with Chris Wheatley, Director of Queensland-based
  firm [Scope Accounting](https://www.scopeaccounting.com.au/). We discuss how [Sharesight
  Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/au/pro/) helps improve productivity in his business,
  why accountants should switch from Excel to Sharesight Pro, and what makes it such
  a useful tool for preparing deceased estate tax returns. \n\n![Scope Accounting

  Tell us a bit about Scope Accounting and what you do there.\n\nI’m one of two owners
  of Scope Accounting, a suburban accounting business in South East Queensland. We
  have a mix of clients, but many are smaller clients with investing profiles or aspirations.
  Many of them have rental properties and shares, and some of them are self-directed
  investors. Sharesight is definitely a value-add for those clients. We also have
  some small business clients that don’t have shares at the moment but plan to in
  the future. \n\n## What made you decide to use Sharesight? Was there a problem you
  were looking to solve? \n\nWhen I went into business on my own in 2014, I knew I
  needed a solution. The incumbent solution from where I used to work was clunky,
  heavy and expensive for what I needed at the time. I needed something scalable like
  SaaS. I was at a Xero Roadshow and Sharesight was there, and it made sense. And
  since then, I’ve even had clients whose brokers have encouraged them to use Sharesight.
  So it’s become more commonplace for me to use Sharesight Pro to help keep track
  of clients’ tax reporting (dividends, DRPs and CGT), or for those clients who want
  to know what their investments are doing week-to-week, month-to-month and year-to-year.
  \n\n## Tell us about how you use Sharesight in your business.\n\n### Deceased estates\n\nIt
  was originally just me using Sharesight Pro but I had a team of 8 or 10 people and
  Sharesight made it easier to delegate work. We’ve had some deceased estates referred
  to us to do the final tax return and the tax returns for the estate, for which we’ve
  been using Sharesight Pro. When it’s just a mum and dad investor with $4k-worth
  of Telstra shares, it’s not an issue – you just log into the share registry, download
  the form and there are four pieces of paper for the beneficiaries. However, we’re
  talking about someone who purchased BHP in the early 80s before various demergers,
  bonus issues, splits and DRPs; or someone who has an average cost base of 77 cents
  for CSL shares because they’ve owned them through a multitude of splits, purchase
  plans and rights issues since they were listed. \n\nSo from a productivity point
  of view, in the last year or so, we have started to use Sharesight Pro a lot more.
  Because with deceased estates, let’s just say that our ageing population means we’re
  going to have a lot of people dying with multi-million dollar share portfolios and
  their kids are going to have no idea about anything. And if their accountant still
  has everything on Excel… there’s 40 years of history in some of these shares. Like
  with BHP, Rio Tinto, Coles, Woolworths, you just can’t do that in Excel. Sharesight
  is able to take care of a lot of this, which saves a ton of time. \n\n### Productivity\n\nSharesight
  Pro is great for our workflow. You can access it anywhere, plus clients can access
  it and upload their information. They also know what we need (based on the previous
  year) and they know what reports we can get out of Sharesight. So after year one,
  there’s just a smarter breed of clients using Sharesight. \n\n> In terms of productivity,
  it definitely gives us a faster turnaround time and job throughput, because what
  could take 3 hours in Excel takes 20 minutes in Sharesight. \n\n### Reports\n\nSome
  of my favourite features are the [Historical Cost Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/prepare-your-annual-accounts-with-sharesights-historical-cost-report/),
  because I can reconcile it back to the balance sheet, and the [Unrealised CGT report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/),
  which makes it easy to make informed liquidation decisions. \n\n## How does Sharesight
  add value for your clients?\n\nOur clients like to see the reporting at Sharesight.
  It’s relevant to their wealth and provides factual information in a format that
  they can easily read, with the tax consequences taken into account. This allows
  them to make informed tax-based decisions about their share portfolio. In general,
  Sharesight Pro gives our clients a more consolidated and accurate view of their
  investments, which they can see at any point in time. \n\nIt’s worth switching clients
  from Excel to Sharesight Pro because in the long-term, it’s a better experience
  for the accountant and the client. As I said to one of my main clients, \"I’m setting
  you up in Sharesight because it will save you time in the future and will be cheaper
  with the hourly rate if you take into account cost allocation\". For example, by
  using Sharesight Pro for this client’s accounting we noticed that we missed out
  on adding a purchase, as we could see on the holding statement that there was an
  open balance. We wouldn’t have even looked unless we were trying to reconcile the
  [Historical Cost Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/prepare-your-annual-accounts-with-sharesights-historical-cost-report/).
  That’s just one example of the added value you get from Sharesight Pro. \n\n<div
