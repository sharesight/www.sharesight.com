:url_slug: top-20-asx-trades-sharesight-users-november-2021
:content: "Welcome to the November 2021 edition of Sharesight’s monthly ASX trading
  snapshot, where we look at the top 20 trades Sharesight users made on the ASX during
  the month. \n\nIn this snapshot, buy trades were strongly led by Westpac (ASX: WBC),
  which has seen a steep decline in its share price throughout November. At the same
  time, sell trades were led by Vulcan Energy (ASX: VUL), which has recently faced
  public backlash from a short seller who claims the company is misleading investors
  about the success of its Rhine Valley lithium project. Overall, it was a strong
  month for trades in the mining and natural resources sectors, with almost half of
  November’s top trades belonging to these sectors. \n\n## Top 20 ASX trades November
