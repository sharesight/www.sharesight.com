:content: "###### Important Disclaimer. Sharesight does not provide tax or investment
  advice. The buying of shares can be complex and varies by country. You should seek
  tax and investment advice specific to your situation before acting on any of the
  information in this article.\n\nQuantitative-value investing is a rules-based investing
  methodology for long-term investors. As its name implies, it merges mathematical
  analysis used by quantitative investors with the principles of value investing.
  By doing so, it helps to remove the emotion from investing, and cuts through the
  noise of the market. As such, it may provide a basis to improve your investment
  decisions. Here’s how it’s done.\n\n![What is quantitative-value investing](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2arRABiYbho2DO1Hpzmfqv/7ea0289d4287f7208910fd2272cc2034/What_is_quantitative-value_investing_copy.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How to implement quantitative-value investing \n\n### Step 1. Build a strategy\n\nIt
  starts with a strategy. The strategy is made up of two parts:\n\n1. Risk framework\n-
  Portfolio diversification & rebalancing method\n\n2. Stock selection method\n- Ranking
  the market & setting your buy/sell rules\n\nA risk framework is created by adjusting
  your portfolio’s diversification and rebalancing methodology. Stocks are selected
  by ranking the whole market using metrics you know will target the companies you
  like (e.g. small companies, undervalued companies, dividend payers, companies with
  strong price momentum etc) and setting rules which will buy and sell them.\n\n###
  Step 2. Test your strategy\n\nOnce you’ve got your strategy, you need to test it
  over different markets and over different time periods. This helps to set your expectations
  going forward and ensures your strategy is reasonably robust.\n\n### Step 3. Follow
  your strategy  \n\nTo track the stocks entering or leaving your strategy, you need
  to link it to a model portfolio. A model portfolio ties your strategy to the daily
  movements of the market, and allows you to compare its performance to your real
  portfolio.\n\n## Want to implement quantitative-value investing?\n\nSharesight users
  are able to connect their portfolios to quantitative-value backtesting engine Forwardcaster
  via the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).\n\nUsing Forwardcaster,
