:title: Livewire Live portfolio – December 2016 update
:url_slug: livewire-live-portfolio-december-2016-update
:content: "In June of 2016 [we attended Livewire Live](/blog/livewire-live/), where
  some of Australia’s top fund managers gave their stock picks for the coming year.
  We built [a backdated portfolio of those picks](/blog/livewire-portfolio-track-the-fund-managers-picks/)
  and we also added the picks from the previous year. We invested $10,000 in each
  company.\n\nSix months have elapsed since we started tracking the 2016 expert picks,
  and 18 months have elapsed since the 2015 selections. So, are we up or down? \n\n**Through
  7 January 2017...the fund managers are up slightly, but failed to beat the benchmark.
  The combined portfolio of the picks from 2015 and 2016 is up only 2.9%, which in
  dollar terms equals a gain of $2,704.74.**\n\nOur benchmark STW, the ETF that tracks
  the ASX200, has returned 5% since the first trade was made on 1 June 2015 (annualised).\n\n![Livewire
  Live Portfolio Update - 2016-12](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2jb3OLcuU0M8eWcoM4YAQE/c8009a8eb6c71f434230a2592aa85c2b/featured_livewire-live-portfolio_2016-12.png?w=950)\n![Table
  - Livewire Live Stock Picks 2015-2016](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1jB7x7qnDYkgY6GWOMQOWS/b7600a9d91bd4c53bd198d519593f6dc/table_livewire-live-picks-2016__1_.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  overall return betrays the fact that the 2015 and 2016 picks have performed very
  differently. Keep in mind that the picks from 2015 are annualised, whereas we can
  only use a total return for the 2016 picks since a year has not yet elapsed.\n\n**The
  2015 picks have as a group, returned 28.24%**, generating a capital return of over
  $11,500 and dividend income over $2,400. \n\n**The 2016 picks, however, are down
  18.13%**, posting a capital loss of about $12,500 and dividend income of about $1,300.\n\nThe
  top performer from the class of 2015 remains Ben Griffith's pick of Auckland International
  Airport (AIA), up over 22%.\n\nThe best performing stock of the 2016 class has been
  [Crispin Murray](https://btim.com.au/)'s Qantas (QAN) returning 7.29%. \n\nThe worst
  performer has been [Ben Clark](http://www.tmscapital.com.au/)’s iCar Asia, down
  over 70%.\n\n![Screenshot - Livewire Live Portfolio 2016-12](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7Fa1Gx84eW4IS6EYSE4icq/17b447d60383029d096feec09b22833a/screenshot_livewire-live-portfolio_2016-12.png?w=950)\n\nWe
  know these fund managers would preach long-term investing and patience so we’ll
  keep updating you on their performance throughout 2017. \n\n**A glance at the short
  term (3 months) returns doesn’t do the portfolio any favours... down over 11%...**\n\n######
  Portfolio note: in 2016 APN News & Media issued bonus shares of Nzme Ltd on a 1:1
  basis. Nzme has been added to our portfolio appropriately via our bonus shares corporate
  action functionality.\n\n## Track the Livewire Live portfolio\n\nWe’ve made it easy
