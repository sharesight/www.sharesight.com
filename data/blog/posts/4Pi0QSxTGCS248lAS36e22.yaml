:title: Automatically import SelfWealth trades into Sharesight
:url_slug: automatically-import-selfwealth-trades-into-sharesight
:content: "Did you know that you can automatically import trades from over [170 brokers
  around the world ](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)into your [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/)
  portfolio? In 2012 we developed a solution that allows you to automatically record
  your buy and sell trades via the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  (contract notes) emailed to you when you trade with some brokers.\n\nThis means
  investors trading with [SelfWealth](https://www.selfwealth.com.au/) can easily import
  trades in Australian and US stocks to their Sharesight portfolio, making it easier
  than ever for Australian investors to leverage Sharesight’s award-winning performance,
  [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/) and tax reporting
  features.\n\n![image 0 (37)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6dPsQCCH7eIBBWqcpRLAp3/cb236874eb0a7d4fb1f8028c500f548a/image_0__37_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is SelfWealth?\n\nEstablished in 2012, [SelfWealth](https://www.selfwealth.com.au/)
  is an Australian broker with an online trading platform that offers $9.50 flat-fee
  trades on Australian and US stocks. The platform allows Australian investors to
  trade on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
  and Nasdaq, which [Sharesight also supports](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  Other key features include a portfolio comparison tool that allows investors to
  monitor other traders’ profitable portfolios, as well as a research tool that gives
  investors access to data on featured stocks. \n\n## Import your SelfWealth data
  to Sharesight\n\nSharesight allows you to import your historical and ongoing trades
  in Australian and US stocks and ETFs through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature, or you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading
  a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet\n\nOne
  simple way to import historical trades to Sharesight is by uploading a [spreadsheet
  file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  filled with trades from your trading account. All you need to do is select “Import
  from a broker” from Sharesight’s  “Add holdings” screen, then select the SelfWealth
  broker tile to get started.\n\n![selfwealth import2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6lA58BcitQVdR9O5ScaHar/56fdc582a12edcc5b5306a68b69e2bce/selfwealth_import2.jpg?w=950)\n\nYou
  will then have the option of uploading your spreadsheet file, which will allow you
  to quickly bulk import the trading data you wish to see in your portfolio.\n\n__Note:__
  You can also upload your spreadsheet file by clicking “Import from a File” on the
  “Add holdings” page, however you may be required to format your file to ensure it
  contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1).
  To avoid this, it is advised that you upload your spreadsheet file using the method
  outlined above. \n\nFor more information on importing SelfWealth trades to Sharesight
  via spreadsheet, see our [Help page](https://help.sharesight.com/au/selfwealth/).
  \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s
  [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n### How to automatically email SelfWealth trade confirmations
  to Sharesight\n\nIt is possible to set up your SelfWealth brokerage account to automatically
  send a copy of your trade confirmation emails to Sharesight. To set this up in SelfWealth,
  just follow these simple steps: \n\n1. Once you're signed into SelfWealth, click
  \"Trading Account\" on the bottom left hand side of the page.\n\n2. Click \"Contract
  Notes\".\n\n3. Click \"Add New\", paste your Sharesight portfolio email address,
  and click \"Save\".\n\n![image 3 (3)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3eNcOtwfMZfRmX6rcprGvN/c8b4cb343170b4bae49e86f9c2ead500/image_3__3_.jpg?w=950)\n\n**Note:**
  While the Trade Confirmation Emails feature can also be used to import historical
  trades, for bulk imports it is suggested that you upload your trades via spreadsheet
  file, as outlined in the section above. \n\nFor more help with syncing SelfWealth
