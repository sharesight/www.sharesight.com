:url_slug: sharesight-mobile-app--april-2017-update
:content: |-
  Following-up on the [last update to our mobile app](/blog/sharesight-mobile-app--january-2017-update/) and all the great [feedback](https://community.sharesight.com/topics/when-are-the-ios-android-mobile-apps-coming-guys) we received, we’re pleased to announce the Sharesight Mobile App -- April 2017 update.

  ## What’s new in the Sharesight Mobile App -- April 2017 update

  Beyond a few bug fixes and numerous styling tweaks to accommodate smaller screen sizes (such as the iPhone 5), here are the two major changes included in this update:

  ### 1. Sign-in via Google

  Clients have already been [signing-up and signing-in to Sharesight using Google](/blog/login-to-sharesight-with-google/) for a couple years now. Today’s update extends this time-saving feature to the mobile app as well:

  ![Sharesight Mobile App - 2017-04 - Google sign-in - med](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5LXVAWjVsc0kwqkesAME6K/c80834c065197a925d9e7563c39728e3/sharesight-mobile-app-2017-04-google-sign-in_med.png?w=950)

  **Note that to use this feature you must sign-in to Sharesight using your Google/Gmail email address.** If your usual Sharesight login (email) is not your Google/Gmail email address, you may update it by [logging-in to Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/login) and navigating to “Account Settings” > “My Details” > “Change Email”.

  ### 2. 20 minute delayed pricing for the ASX and NZX

  When we launched the [Sharesight mobile app](/blog/introducing-the-sharesight-mobile-app/) in late 2016, we knew that intra-day pricing was the next logical step. So after recently introducing [20 minute delayed pricing on the Sharesight website for ASX and NZX listed shares](/blog/introducing-20-minute-delayed-pricing-for-asx-holdings/), we’re pleased to now offer this feature on the mobile app:

  ![sharesight-mobile-app-2017-04-20-min-delayed-pricing](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1sTMSMdvcMmO6wooskKqoa/280f5b79181225f300eeac72267fc573/sharesight-mobile-app-2017-04-20-min-delayed-pricing.png?w=950)

  **Note that you will need to hit the “refresh” icon in order to see the latest prices.**

  ## What’s next
  This will likely be the last major mobile app update for a little while as we’re buckling-down on our (ever-growing) list of feature and partnership requests. However please continue to share your thoughts on the mobile app via the [Sharesight Mobile App forum topic](https://community.sharesight.com/topics/when-are-the-ios-android-mobile-apps-coming-guys) so that we can track and prioritise them accordingly.
