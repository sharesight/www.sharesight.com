  What is the FIRE investment movement?\n\n[FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement)
  is an investment movement with the goal of building sufficient wealth to be able
  to afford to live from the income generated by your investments alone, opening up
  the option to retire early.\n\nAt its core, FIRE places a heavy emphasis on setting
  an aggressive rate of savings, preferably as early in your life as possible (start
  as soon as you earn income, with the aim to have the option to retire in your 30s).
  By saving aggressively, and investing those savings, compounded investment returns
  result can rapidly increase your capital wealth to the point where the interest/return/dividends
  from your investments are sufficient to cover your living expenses in perpetuity.
