:title: Sharesight co-founder’s most rewarding investment
:content: "I’m Tony Ryburn, Executive Chairman and co-founder of [Sharesight](/).
  Today I would like to share with you a side project that I have been working on
  for some time. Unlike Sharesight it is guaranteed to never make a profit. But it
  has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Let me explain why.\n\n<a

  data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"1\">KES - Sharesight co-founder’s
  most rewarding investment</a>\n\n## The gift of education\nIt all started way back
  in 1992 when my wife Merle and I sponsored a seriously deprived young Kenyan boy,
  Noah, to attend [Starehe](http://www.stareheboyscentre.ac.ke/sbc/), a charitable
  boarding school in Nairobi.\n\n![KES - Noah & letters](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3a4qbB8cCcUwSqQYgyess0/c8dc1dd13cb0d0a52977cdcfc4bd440f/KES_Noah-letters.jpg?w=950)\n\nWe
  frequently received long handwritten letters from Noah telling us about his life
  and expressing his gratitude for our help. We were so captivated by Noah’s story
  that in 1993 Merle and I took our three sons (including Sharesight CTO Scott Ryburn)
  to Kenya to visit Noah in person. We visited him at school and also visited his
  family who lived in grass huts in a small village which was several hundred kilometers
  away from Nairobi in desert-like conditions.\n\n![KES - Ryburn Family & Noah](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6qIsU0M5gsoWouOWec6YIW/6db0ed78dbd454ea3fb26efabc7ad2a2/KES_family.jpg?w=950)\n<small>Noah

  co-founders Tony and Scott) in Kenya in 1993.</small>\n\nReceiving food and education
  totally changed Noah’s life and he committed himself to ensuring that as many deprived
  children as possible benefit in the same way that he did. Inspired by his dedication,
  we decided to privately fund Noah so he could attend university and qualify as a
  secondary teacher. After graduating, Noah got married and had three children of
  his own. Because he was so appreciative of our help, he decided to name his eldest
  daughter and son after us, Merle and Tony. \n\n![KES Merle-Mercy-Tony](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/FcPuyY8dgGy4YIs0KuwgU/43f704f5bd8d5b12556139347f297121/KES_Merle-Mercy-Tony.jpg?w=950)\n<small>Merle,
  Mercy and Tony</small>\n\n## KES is born\nWhile keeping in touch with Noah over
  the years, he always made it very clear that he wanted to \"give back\" to the next
  generation of children who suffer as he suffered as a child. So in 2013, Merle and
  I helped Noah set-up his own school for underprivileged children in the slums of
  Likoni which is just south of Mombasa in Kenya. It is called the [Kenya Excellent
  Centre and School (KES)](https://keskenya.com/).\n\n![KES - Tony & Noah](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/75rOE3Hc0EiCKYW4csGyYs/fdc4aec807fd7d0b6f9cdf114a53b1ad/KES_Tony-Noah.jpg?w=950)\n\nThere
  are many under-privileged, malnourished young children of all ages in Likoni. They
  spend their day helping their parents earn a meagre living or begging and scrounging
  for food. Merle and I visited a number of these families in Likoni last year and
  it is no exaggeration to say that for many children going to school would mean getting
  little or nothing to eat. Often children have no parents due to AIDS or other problems.\n\nWithout
  education these children and their families cannot break the poverty cycle. The
  result is that disease and destitution continue for another generation. To make
  matters worse, lack of education and consequent unemployment frequently leads to
  drug abuse, early pregnancy, crime, and other at-risk behaviour.\n\n![KES - local
  family](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/51KQi94CWAKuuO48kY4gac/49fe072f7f92ea666d74b4c9db398a66/KES_local-family.jpg?w=950)\n<small>None
  of these children were going to school when this photo was taken because they could
  not afford to. Now the older children attend KES.</small>\n\nKES staff identify
  seriously deprived young children in Likoni who are not attending school. They meet
  with the child’s caregivers whether they be parents, older siblings or relatives
  and explain to them the importance of sending the kids to school.\n\n![KES - lunch](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/EVHWnnlogoOQ0m44KwcMw/2b33bd4a9f86a23686126b1d7678ae9d/KES_lunch.jpg?w=950)\n\nParents
  must make a contribution to KES for their child's education if possible. Most parents
  can only afford a token amount and often it is clear to KES staff that caregivers
  cannot adequately feed their children, let alone pay school fees. KES provides food
  for these children at school.\n\n![KES - classroom](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7atWxPygGQaIoOW60M6ISA/c15d91723f86613dc6a01dedb510ea0e/KES_Classroom.jpg?w=950)\n\n**KES
  has grown rapidly with nearly 200 children.** More than 40 of these children are
  fed at school.\n\nSadly there are many more children who need our help.\n\n![featured

  Help us educate more children\nIf you would like to join the Sharesight team and
  help us meet this need that would be fantastic. Every dollar we receive less any
  bank fees goes to educating and feeding seriously deprived children.\n\n## [DONATE
