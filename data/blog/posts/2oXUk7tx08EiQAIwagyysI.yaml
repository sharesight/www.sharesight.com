:title: What is a corporate action?
:content: "The term \"corporate action\" might sound dull, but when they occur, [corporate
  actions](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/) can have material impacts
  on your investment performance.\n\nThe term reminds me of the cheesy 1987 film,
  [Secret of My Success](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093936/), starring Michael
  J. Fox. At one point, Fox’s character says something like \"if we reduce costs and
  increase revenue, we can turn this thing around!\" A bunch of people nod, one guy
  points to a folded copy of the Wall Street Journal, charts are pointed at, and there
  you have it... corporate action.\n\nThe bottom line for you, the investor, is that
  the corporate actions decided in the boardroom impact the investment performance
  and tax of shareholders. When a [corporate action is announced](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/corporate-actions/)
  you can bet on dramatic share price fluctuations -- and where there are performance
  disruptions, there are also tax implications.\n\nIn Australia, we’ve seen a flurry
  of corporate action activity this year involving some well-known brands. [Wesfarmers
  announced they’ll demerge their Coles Supermarkets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/wesfarmers-coles-demerger-details/)
  business, [Nine Entertainment Group announced plans to  acquire Fairfax Media](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/fairfax-nine-merger-details/),
  and French company [Unibail Rodamco is acquiring Australian shopping centre operator
  Westfield](https://help.sharesight.com/how-to-handle-unibail-rodamco-acquisition-of-westfield-corporation/).\n\nIn
  the simplest terms, a corporate action refers to when a company buys or spins off
  another company, or vice versa. There are a range of other complexities involving
  [mergers](https://help.sharesight.com/mergers/), overseas stock exchanges, partial
  sales, special dividends, delistings, etc.\n\n## For investors, a corporate action
  typically results in:\n\n* Another company appearing in your portfolio\n\n* The
  company you originally bought is replaced by another \n\n* You receiving a special
  cash dividend\n\nTechnically, [dividends](/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  are corporate actions as well.\n\nIn many cases, your [broker won’t have a record
  of these corporate actions](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/),
  which means you may be investing blind if you rely on these figures -- unless you
  use [Sharesight](/) of course!\n\nUsing the [acquisition of Westfield](https://help.sharesight.com/how-to-handle-unibail-rodamco-acquisition-of-westfield-corporation/)
  for example, an investor owning Westfield shares will end up owning shares in not
  one, but **_two_** new companies and receive a cash distribution. Complex to be
  sure, but where does that leave you in terms of managing your portfolio?\n\n## How
  corporate actions affect your performance\n\nWhen corporate actions are announced,
  the share market typically reacts in a dramatic way -- positively or negatively
  -- to the news. On the day the NEG/FXJ merger was announced Nine’s share fell 12%,
  while the price of Fairfax rose by 13% by the end of trade.\n\nObviously, you’ll
  want to stay on top of these corporate actions as they will affect the value of
  your portfolio. Fortunately with [Sharesight you can be alerted when dramatic share
  ](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-sharesight-email-alerts-you-should-enable-today/)[price
  changes](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-sharesight-email-alerts-you-should-enable-today/)
  like this occur.\n\nBut as an investor, after a corporate action takes place your
  portfolio might now include holdings in unfamiliar companies. If you diligently
  research which companies to buy, it can be upsetting to now own something you are
  not familiar with.\n\nAs an example, years ago, I bought Spectra, an American energy
  company specialising in natural gas transportation. My theory was, \"this is an
  undervalued company poised to take advantage of the natural gas boom, and the US
  is transitioning to exporting more and more of its energy\". This theory worked
  for awhile, until the company was acquired by Enbridge, a Canadian company. After
  looking into the acquirer, I wasn’t really interested in being a shareholder so
  I sold out of the position before my theory could take effect.\n\nOne-off, cash
  dividends as a result of corporate actions are also common. These are the result
  of the acquiring company using shares and cash to purchase the target company. If
  you’re not monitoring your portfolio, you might be surprised to find a significant
  cash balance upon your next login. Receiving cash dividends like this is not necessarily
  a bad thing, unless of course you want to remain fully invested in the market. And
  of course, receiving a cash payment comes with tax implications.\n\n## How corporate
  actions affect your tax\n\nEvery corporate action is different, and each carry their
  own tax rules, which vary by country.\n\nCorporate actions have a way of rewriting
  your investment history. If a company you own spins-off a new listed company, in
  effect you ’acquire’ that company at a particular price -- almost like a forced
  buy. That is, the transaction results in a change to your original cost base, which
  in turn affects your [capital gain or loss](https://help.sharesight.com/capital_gains/)
  amount.\n\nIf there is any sort of special or one-off dividend payment, typically
  this is treated as taxable income at the highest rate. In some instances, you might
  receive a stapled security or hybrid investment. These can combine equity and debt
  securities, resulting in you receiving some kind of fixed interest payment.\n\n###
  Sharesight and corporate actions\n\nAt Sharesight, we automatically handle most
  corporate actions that impact your portfolio. Whenever dividends, company name changes
  or share splits occur they will typically be recorded automatically by Sharesight
  on your behalf, and you’ll be alerted via our email notification feature.\n\n![Date

  are some corporate actions, however, where there are adjustments you’ll need to
  record manually. Anytime there’s a shareholder decision involved (e.g. do you want
  a cash dividend or shares?) you’ll need to take action inside Sharesight.\n\nThe
