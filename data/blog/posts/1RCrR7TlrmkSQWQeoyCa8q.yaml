:title: High returns - the market for marijuana
:content: "With Canada recently becoming the [second country to legalise recreational
  ](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/17/cannabis-becomes-legal-in-canada-marijuana)marijuana,
  we thought it would be a good time to explore the world of cannabis and the share
  market.\n\nThe debate over the legalisation of cannabis is one that has been raging
  on for decades. *Is it dangerous? *Does it have therapeutic effects? If we make
  it legal, won’t people just sit around all day and do nothing?*\n\nMarijuana has
  for years, and continues to be, the [most widely used recreational drug](https://www.smh.com.au/national/cannabis-most-widely-used-drug-on-earth-20120106-1pnej.html)
  (outside alcohol/nicotine) in the world. In fact, Australians have the [highest
  rate of cannabis use worldwide](https://www.smh.com.au/healthcare/global-drug-survey-2017-finds-australians-are-the-biggest-bong-users-pay-most-for-cocaine-20170523-gwb2jd.html)!\n\n![ASX
  weed stocks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4d2oQoirbGqicsKgYUCAYO/9796bac09f0318e019ba386972dec1f5/ASX_weed_stocks.jpg?w=950)\n\nWhile
  it is the most commonly-used illicit substance, the stigma of being considered a
  highly dangerous drug (cannabis was given the same warnings as drugs like LSD) has
  never been easy to shake off. Attitudes have slowly begun to change, so much so
  that in addition to Canada and Uruguay, the USA has seen [33 states legalise the
  use of marijuana,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._jurisdiction)
  mostly for medicinal purposes, with 10 of those legalising it for recreational use.\n\n##
  Weed stocks take off\n\nWith more countries legalising the use of marijuana, inevitably
  there has been a wave of companies looking to capitalise on the new market opportunities.
  Marijuana stocks (or more commonly referred to as \"weed stocks\") have surged in
  popularity among investors looking to get a hit of this emerging trend, most notably
  in Canada and the USA. Investors aren’t only buying weed stocks directly, with the
  emergence of at least [five marijuana based exchange traded funds](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4152730-marijuana-etf-best)
  looking to satisfy investor demand.\n\n## Australia joins the weed stocks gold rush
  \n\nAustralia looks like it is starting to shake the stigma around marijuana too,
  with a number of states starting to legalise marijuana for a [limited number of
  medicinal uses](https://www.canstar.com.au/health-insurance/victoria-legalises-medicinal-marijuana/).
  In January, the Australian Government announced it would become the fourth country
  in the world to [legalise medicinal marijuana exports](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-cannabis/australia-to-permit-medicinal-cannabis-exports-in-bid-to-capture-lucrative-market-idUSKBN1ET0D2)
  - targeting a $55 billion global market.\n\nLooking to take advantage of this, a
  number of weed stocks have listed on the ASX, including not only the more well-known
  companies such as Auscann Group Ltd (AC8.ASX), but also all manner of new firms
  and existing ASX-listed companies pivoting into the marijuana space. \n\nWhile the
  industry, and the legal environment surrounding it, are still in a stage of infancy,
  this hasn’t stopped some companies (and their investors) seeing massive intraday
  stock price jumps, or huge short-term gains - often off the back of something as
  simple as the announcement of a new advisor to their board.\n\n## ASX weed stock
  portfolio\n\nWe built a portfolio of 27 ASX-listed companies that are either fully
  or partially in the marijuana space. Over the last 2 years that portfolio has returned
  13.44% p.a. - with most gains seen in the lead up to, and shortly after, the Australian
  Government announced its changes to marijuana export laws in January 2018. Since
  then however, the story has not been as rosy, with the reality seemily not living
  up to the hype. \n\n![ASX weed stocks portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/622jo0cLmgSuYcoCeGy0cu/1b32841b9aa694988441628137bb9dbb/ASX_weed_stocks_portfolio.png?w=950)\n\n###
  ASX weed stocks performance\n\nWithin the portfolio there are standout performers
  like the aforementioned Auscann Group Holdings, with a 189.79% return, and Cann
  Group (CAN.ASX) returning 142.92%. But on the flip side are companies like Roots
  Sustainable (ROO.ASX) and Esence Lab Ltd (ESE.ASX) that have returned -74.73% and
  -48.95% over the last 2 years.\n\nHere’s how the rest of the companies in our theoretical
  ASX weed stocks portfolio performed over the last two years:\n\n![Australian weed
  stock performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2013Gl3WWMQAqcioYMegGA/b66830b0ae44e02cac42141156b38e62/Australian_weed_stock_performance.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Will the high last?\n\nA lot of the recent talk has centred around whether or not
  this new sector of the market is in a bubble. [Some commentators are adamant it
  is](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/cannabis-stock-highs-4-marijuana-market-warnings-for-investors.html),
  while others stress that conditions will calm as investors begin to weed out companies
  that are just trying to ride the high. Among the rush of companies in the space
  just looking to jump on this emerging trend, there are a growing number of who are
  developing products and therapies, helping this field and industry grow. These are
  the companies that will persevere, once the initial high wears off.\n\n## Track
