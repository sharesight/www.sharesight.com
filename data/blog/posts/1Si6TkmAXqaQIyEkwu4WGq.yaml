:content: "Sharesight’s tailored edition for financial professionals, [Sharesight
  Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/), is loved by accounting firms of all sizes
  – from solo practices to the \"Big Four.\" From [Bay Financial Partners](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/bay-financial-partners/),
  to [Growthwise](http://www.growthwise.com.au/news/2015/meet-sharesight-the-1-tool-for-perfect-portfolio-management),
  to [PwC](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/pwc-partners-with-sharesight/), these firms
  have embraced Sharesight’s powerful stock market data aggregation tools and comprehensive
  tax reports, which save them hours of manual “portfolio admin” and allow them to
  focus on growing their business.\n\n![6 reasons why accountants love Sharesight
  Pro](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/wKN5VIEkBbYkr6RKAPfr6/205b37a8360681217c5ce94a91530b05/6_reasons_why_accountants_love_Sharesight_Pro.jpg?w=950)\n\nHere
  are 6 reasons why accountants love Sharesight Pro:\n\n## 1 – Effortless setup\n\nDoes
  the excitement of signing a new client quickly get overshadowed by the dread of
  portfolio reconstruction? Whether you’re looking to track opening balances or history
  going back 20 years, setting up a Sharesight Pro portfolio is incredibly straightforward.\n\nThat’s
  because from day one, Sharesight Pro partners work with a dedicated account manager
  who provides one-on-one training and assists with portfolio setup. If your client
  only has a few shares, we’ll show you how to manually upload them in just a few
  clicks. Otherwise you may sync the data from their [online broker](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/),
  or import it via [spreadsheet (csv)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  Setting up client portfolios in minutes instead of hours or days allows you to attract
  new clients, or claim back some hours in your day.\n\n## 2 – Automatic portfolio
  admin\n\nA portfolio is an ever-changing entity, which updates throughout the day.
  So in order to stay ahead of portfolio admin (and minimise any surprises at tax
  time), it’s crucial to track the market, as well as a client’s transactions as they
  occur.\n\nTraditionally, accounting firms have had to purchase expensive databases
  in order to access historical share prices, dividends, and corporate actions data.
  Beyond the hassle of software downloads, updates and licenses, the main issue with
  this model is that the data quickly goes stale. In other words, the only time the
  data is current is on the day the work is done. The actual portfolio moves on, the
  spreadsheet does not.\n\nTo fill the gaps, accounting firms are left badgering clients
  for this data. This paper-chase is not only time-consuming but annoying for both
  the accountant and client. Think shoe boxes overflowing with contract notes/trade
  confirmations and dividend statements. It’s not pretty.\n\nSharesight Pro solves
  these problems by **automatically tracking share prices, currency fluctuations,
  and corporate actions such as dividends, [DRPs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  and [share splits like Apple’s below](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-investors-need-to-know-about-stock-splits/)**.\n\n![Sharesight
  Apple Share Split](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2uE9LGRKdhl9NostgVU141/cf673f26d2f3efa7157b5c65f4a41c3b/Sharesight_Apple_Share_Split.png?w=950)\n\nAnd
  as a bonus, if your clients trade with one of our 170+ [supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/),
  their trades can be automatically sent to Sharesight, so their portfolios are always
  up-to-date with their latest trades.\n\n## 3 – Comprehensive tax reporting\n\nWith
  an investor’s entire investment portfolio in one place, and up-to-date, Sharesight
  Pro provides accountants with everything they need for tax preparation. We take
  it one step further by providing comprehensive tax reports that can be accessed
  in one click:\n\n* [All Trades Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/view-and-export-your-trading-history-with-the-all-trades-report/):
  View your client’s complete trading history \n\n* [Historical Cost Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/prepare-your-annual-accounts-with-sharesights-historical-cost-report/):
  View opening & closing balances at cost price\n\n* [Sold Securities Report](https://help.sharesight.com/sold_shares/):
  View the price on shares sold\n\n* [Taxable Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report/):
  See all dividend & interest payments received\n\n* Capital Gains Tax Report ([Australia](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  & [Canada](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/))
  \n\n* [Unrealised CGT Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  (Australia)\n\n* [Foreign Investment Fund / FIF Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/)
  (New Zealand) \n\n* [Traders Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculating-taxable-gains-on-share-trading-in-new-zealand/):
  For NZ investors classified as ‘traders’ by the IRD \n\nBy having everything you
  need in one place to prepare and file tax returns, tasks that normally took hours
  or even days can now be done in minutes, in just a few clicks. So rather than spending
  copious amounts of time looking back over the year’s activities and preparing tax
  returns, you can spend your time having forward-looking tax discussions instead
  – and not just at tax time, but throughout the year.\n\n## 4 – Secure & flexible
  account sharing options with clients\n\nRather than passing spreadsheets back and
  forth, Sharesight Pro allows you to [grant access to staff and clients](https://help.sharesight.com/share_with_client/)
  according to the level of access they require: read, read/write, or admin.\n\nThe
  degree to which an accountant involves clients is up to each firm, and depends on
  the type of client. If you have clients who are hands-on investors, you can provide
  them with read/write access from the get-go so they can import their portfolio from
  their online broker. This allows them to dictate how much trading history is added
  to Sharesight, and lets them manage the portfolio from an investing standpoint.
  On the other hand, if your client only holds a few shares and relies on your expertise,
  you may decide to just generate tax-time reports without sharing access at all.\n\nFor
  some accountants, [sharing portfolio access with clients](https://help.sharesight.com/share_with_client/)
  takes some getting used to. Apart from portfolio setup, there’s very little ongoing
  administration work to be done. While this may jeopardise portfolio admin fees,
  we argue that it strengthens the relationship long-term by allowing you to focus
  on more rewarding, pro-active activities. A strategic tax planning discussion, for
  example, is a lot more valuable than a tax retrospective. The beauty of the cloud
  ecosystem is that it relies on client engagement to really hum. We land on the side
  of an informed client being a happy client.\n\n## 5 – Seamless Xero integration\n\nWe
  have an award-winning integration with [Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/).
  So if your accounting firm uses the leading cloud accounting system, you’re in luck.
  That’s because when you synchronise a Sharesight portfolio to Xero, details of share
  purchases, sales, and dividends flow into Xero automatically, and in real-time.
  This allows you to easily reconcile portfolio data against bank statements – at
  a time that is convenient for you.\n\n![Sharesight Xero Min](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/t3SQrOL2B8T1hcjYJaBsL/fd0bf915b6b953c9508411887507454d/Sharesight_Xero_Min.png?w=950)\n\nFurthermore,
  Sharesight can pull-in bank account balances, term deposits and cash investments
  from Xero, so you can view complete financial positions directly within Sharesight
  portfolios. \n\n## 6 – Cost effective \n\nWhether you need to track 5 portfolios
  or 500, **Sharesight Pro partners only pay $12 per portfolio, per month**. There
  are no hidden fees, no extras that you have to pay for and no contracts. The price
  remains the same – no matter the portfolio value. And the more portfolios you set
