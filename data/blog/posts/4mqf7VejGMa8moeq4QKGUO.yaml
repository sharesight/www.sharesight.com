:title: 2018 Stock Picking Competition September Update
:url_slug: 2018-stock-picking-competition-september-update
:content: "Last year we emailed [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com) users asking
  them to nominate one stock (from select markets) they believed would be the top
  performer for the 2018 calendar year (January to December). We then constructed
  a Sharesight portfolio containing the nearly 100 stocks chosen, allocating $10,000
  to each in the portfolio. \n\nWe’re approaching the third quarter point in our 2018
  stock picking competition. So nine months in, which stocks are in the lead, and
  which have performed the worst in the competition?\n\n![featured sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2c0QkcckTOG6ogCOoSG0OM/4bfa658c0ff385d657680e730f455704/featured_sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How is the overall portfolio performing?\n\nAs at September 25 when our snapshot
  was taken, the Sharesight stock picking competition portfolio was up 0.65% overall,
  rebounding from the -2.90% result recorded in the June snapshot. This contrasts
  with a 5.79% gain for the ASX200 (using the [STW.AX Spdr 200 Fund ETF as a benchmark](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)).
  As we noted previously, this suggests that individual growth stocks that might be
  potential winners in a stock picking competition may not be the best to build a
  portfolio around.\n\n![Stock picking competition 2018 september](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4x2rwYbNWowASwKEQucS4y/4d6eea35b2cb631365f33c3b7dc59c85/Stock_picking_competition_2018_september.PNG)\n\n##

  Nearmap Limited (ASX.NEA)\n\nThe international provider of high resolution aerial
  imagery has shown continued momentum, and has now returned 197.48% during the year,
  with the company [breaking into the S&P ASX 300 index in August](https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2018/09/07/nearmap-ltd-asxnea-and-kogan-com-ltd-asxkgn-just-entered-the-sp-asx-300-index/)
  and seeing returns of 400% over the last 3 years.\n\n### Afterpay Touch (ASX:APT)\n\nAfterpay
  Touch held the top performer position for most of the quarter trading at all time
  highs above $20 during August, [before sliding almost 25% in early September](https://www.fool.com.au/2018/09/07/why-the-afterpay-touch-group-ltd-share-price-is-falling-again/)
  after Afterpay announced an [expansion into the UK after acquiring 90% of existing
  operator ClearPay Finance](https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/afterpay-announces-uk-expansion-as-sales-volume-soars-20180822-h14crh)
  and raising $104 million to fund growth. Afterpay shares have returned 171.86% year
  to date.\n\n### Seafarms Group Ltd (ASX:SFG)\n\nThe company reached an agreement
  in May with Japan based Nissui (TYO:1332) over a $24.99 million equity investment
  in Seafarms Group that would assist in the development of Seafarms’ Project Sea
  Dragon plans to build a large scale prawn aquaculture project in northern Australia
  to produce prawns for export markets. The first major piece of the project was announced
  in June, with the acquisition of a [52ha site in Kununurra](https://thewest.com.au/business/seafarms-group-secures-kununurra-site-for-project-sea-dragon-ng-b88521387z)
  to build the processing plant for the project. This sent shares higher -- now 109.68%
  up for the year.\n\n### Cynata Therapeutics Limited (ASX:CYP)\n\nThe Australian
  based stem cell therapy company announced it has [“met all clinical endpoints” on
  its stage 1 trial of drug CYP-001 and is looking to stage 2 trials](https://smallcaps.com.au/cynata-therapeutics-advance-cymerus-stem-cell-treatment-phase-2-trials/)
  and has [Japanese rivals scrambling to catch up](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Japan-hurries-to-regain-lead-in-race-for-stem-cell-therapies).
  Cynata’s shares have slid slightly compared to their June position, and are now
  up 109.68% for the year to date.\n\n### Altium Limited (ASX:ALU)\n\nThis Australian
  based PCB design software company has continued to surge higher throughout 2018.
  Following the theme of [tech stocks on the ASX performing well in 2018](https://www.fool.com.au/2018/09/25/why-tech-shares-are-such-attractive-investments/),
  Altium continued to surge in the third quarter up from its 79.53% return in June
  to 94.88% in September.\n\n## 5 worst performing stocks in 2018\n\n![worst 5 stocks

  Blue Sky Limited (ASX.BLA)\n\nAfter being the [target of short seller Glaucus back
  in April](http://www.afr.com/markets/behind-blue-skys-brutal-multiyear-war-with-short-sellers-20180406-h0yfa7),
  Blue Sky’s share price has not recovered since taking out the worst performer crown
  in our June update, with a total return of -89.27% and only improving marginally
  since to a -89.13% return in September. \n\n### Ookami Limited (ASX:OOK)\n\nAfter
  buying a ‘strategic equity position’ in [blockchain company Brontech](https://stockhead.com.au/tech/ookami-rockets-69pc-buying-piece-blockchain-biz-brontech/)
  in December 2017 (and pushing shares up 42% at the time), the stock fell considerably
  through to June, and has now settled around a total return of -86.43% year to date.\n\n###
  TheBetmakers (ASX.TBH)\n\nFormerly TopBetta Holdings, The Newcastle-based Australian
  online bookmaker changed its name during the quarter after selling its [‘TopBetta’

  \ The company also placed an additional $3 million of shares to raise funds and
  [acquire Global Betting Services and Dynamic Odds in August](http://www.gamingintelligence.com/manda/48885-australia-s-betmakers-set-to-complete-gbs-and-dynamicodds-acquisitions).
  Markets have not reacted kindly to the news during this quarter, pushing returns

  [Retail Food Group’s horror performance in 2017](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-retail-food-group-RFG-shares-slashing-so-quickly-What-is-the-future),
  the fortunes of the company have not improved materially in 2018. The company announced
  a [$306.7 million loss after recording $427 million in asset impairments](https://www.afr.com/business/retail/retail-food-group-crashes-to-307m-loss-after-asset-impairments-store-closure-costs-20180828-h14nbd)
  and costs from closing almost 250 stores during the year. On top of the RFG’s [managing
  director Andrew Nell stepping aside in May and Richard Hinson being appointed CEO](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/embattled-retail-food-group-appoints-new-ceo-20180529-p4zi3s.html),
  RFG’s chairman Colin Archer announced his [retirement with immediate effect](https://finance.nine.com.au/2018/09/25/10/52/retail-food-group-chairman-retires)
  this week. RFG is down 79.96% in 2018.\n\n### KNeoMedia (ASX:KNM)\n\nAfter a $3.85
  million stock placement in October 2017 and sales revenue growing across New York
  public schools, things looked positive for the games-based learning software company,
  however while sales of [$533,404 to June 2018 were up on 2017’s result of $133,760,
  a net loss of $2,349,082](https://t.co/ODn1R80wib) was recorded for the year. Shares
  for KNM returning -79.17% year to date.\n\n## Follow the 2018 Sharesight stock picking
  competition\n\nWe’ve made the [2018 Sharesight stock picking competition portfolio
  public](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)
  for anyone to view, removing the need to be logged-in to Sharesight to follow your
  stock’s performance against all other entries throughout the competition.\n\nEven
  if you don’t have a stock pick, this is an excellent way to follow the Sharesight
  competition. Bookmark the [2018 Sharesight stock picking competition public portfolio](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)
  to check back at any time.\n\n### 2018 Stock Picking Competition Notes:\n\nWe collated
  your responses (discarding invalid picks/typos/duplicates) and created a Sharesight
  portfolio with a holding of each share picked, with the following rules:\n\n- The
  2018 Sharesight Stock Picking Competition portfolio was created with a tax residency
  in Australia (with the performance of shares in markets outside Australia subject
  to currency effects) \n- We “invested” $10,000 in each holding, but did not include
  brokerage for matters of convenience here. (Sharesight factors the impact of fees
  when [calculating portfolio performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/),
  as [reducing portfolio fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092815/how-optimize-your-portfolio-and-reduce-fees.asp)
  can improve returns).\n- All dividends are/will be included in the total performance
  calculation, and are reinvested. \n- Performance figures are total return (versus
  annualised) as none of the portfolio positions has been held for longer than one
  year.\n- The winner will be the person(s) who picked the top performing stock over
  the period January 1st through to December 31st 2018.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
