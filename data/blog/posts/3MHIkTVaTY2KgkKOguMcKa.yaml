:title: 2017 stock picking competition
:content: |-
  Calling all investors! We’re teaming up with [Livewire](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/?utm_source=sharesight&utm_campaign=stock-picking-competition-2017&utm_medium=referral) to run a stock picking competition for 2017 and we need your picks!

  ![featured - hot air balloons](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5Lvs8s2NMWEOkEuwuGIuS6/3425ce7dba8a9bfd6cfbca8692398360/featured_hot-air-balloons.jpg?w=950)

  ## How does it work?
  We’ll email you a survey asking you to nominate **one ASX-listed stock** that you think will be the top performer for the 2017 calendar year (January to December).

  We’ll also take your pulse on some of the burning issues facing Australian investors.

  Livewire will do the same with their audience.

  We’ll tally the five stocks receiving the most votes and create a Sharesight portfolio to track their performance. We’ll create one portfolio of five stocks based on the [Sharesight](/) picks and another portfolio based on the Livewire picks.

  ## Who am I competing with?
  It’s Sharesight customers versus the Livewire readership. So we need your best predictions for the coming year! (FWIW the 2016 Livewire reader picks returned 18%)

  We’re also asking some of Australia’s top fund managers to send us their picks, which we’ll track in a third portfolio -- a battle of DIY investors versus the professionals.

  This year’s participants include:

  - Richard Coppleson (Bell Potter)
  - Steve Johnson (Forager Funds)
  - Chris Stott (Wilson Asset Management)
  - Matthew Kidman (Centennial Funds)
  - Ben Clark (TMS Capital)

  ## How do I track the results?
  In Sharesight of course! When completing the survey, simply indicate that you'd like us to share these portfolios with you. We’ll then make the portfolios available inside your existing Sharesight account for free using our [portfolio sharing feature](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/).

  Note that only those who complete the **entire survey** will be eligible to access the portfolios, including the fund manager portfolio.

  ## What’s in it for me?
  Aside from the portfolio boost you’ll hopefully receive, we’ll announce a special prize for those of you who voted for the best performing stock across all three portfolios.

  And don’t forget that you can gain access to stock pick portfolios by completing the survey.

  ## What’s the deadline?
  To have your vote counted you must submit your responses (by replying to the survey only - no extraneous emails!) by midnight on **31 December 2016**.
