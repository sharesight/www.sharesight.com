:title: Why you should invest in the share market
:url_slug: why-you-should-invest-in-the-share-market
:content: "**I wrote the following article for _Her Magazine_, which was published
  in their August issue**\n\nFor some, the thought of investing in the share market
  is enough to make them go weak at the knees or worse. It conjures up thoughts of
  gambling and crippling losses. And it reminds them of the only two years in recorded
  history that they associate with a financial event: the share market crashes of
  1929 and 1987. You would have to be nuts to even think about investing in shares.\n\nWouldn’t
  you? \n\nWell, no actually. A better definition of nutty would be not thinking about
  investing in shares. Why? The answer is simple. Shares produce higher returns than
  other types of assets. Stock exchanges have been around for a very long time and
  innumerable studies have come up with the same result: over the long haul shares
  do best.\n\nThe phrase ‘over the long haul’ is important because occasionally there
  can be quite long periods when shares look as if they are not going to deliver the
  best long term performance.\n\nA major reason that people lose money on shares is
  that when the market falls, as it inevitably will, they panic and bail out, usually
  after most of the damage has been done. When the market rises again, as it inevitably
  will, they are not there to reap the benefit.\n\nWhen you commit to shares for the
  long haul you soon realise that it is not about share prices; it’s about companies.
  If you focus on the share prices you are likely to get caught up in financial ratios,
  trading strategies and a high-risk game of trying to predict (in reality, guess)
  whether prices are going to go up or down. And even if you are lucky enough to predict
  a price rise or fall, that will not help you much unless you can also figure out
  when. We all know it is going to rain sometime in future but unless you know when,
  you can’t be sure the washing won’t get wet.\n\nWe are not talking rocket science
  here folks. You DO NOT have to be a financial guru and you do not need a financial
  advisor to do well in the share market. All you have to do is focus on companies.
  Look for companies with a proven track record offering top quality products and
  services that you understand and that you think will be in strong demand well into
  the future.\n\nHere are my 10 tips for DIY share market investing:\n\n- Plan to
  be in there for the long haul.\n\n- Only invest money that you are confident you
  are not going to need at a particular time in the future. Otherwise you might be
  forced to cash up your shares in a downturn before they have delivered the superior
  return you are looking for.\n\n- Start out small and increase your investment over
  the years as your knowledge and confidence grows. That way you also avoid the risk
  of investing all your money at a high point in the market.\n\n- Spread your investment
  over a number of different companies in different industries. For example, if you
  have $10,000 to invest consider spreading this over, say, 5 companies. Diversify
  further as your total investment grows. And remember it is as easy to buy Australian
  shares as those in NZ.\n\n- Read articles about companies of interest to you in
  news papers, magazines and online. You will be surprised how quickly your knowledge
  and confidence grows. You can use online tools such as Sharesight to check the historic
  performance of a company to help you with your investment decisions.\n\n- There
  are innumerable share purchase recommendations for free and there are many individuals
  and organisations that provide recommendations to paying subscribers. They can be
  a valuable source of guidance and information but don’t follow them blindly. Do
  your own homework and come to your own decisions.\n\n- Focus on companies not share
  prices when you make your investment decisions.\n\n- Don’t panic if share prices
  suffer a sudden fall. You know in advance that this is likely to happen from time
  to time just as you know that in the long run shares are likely to give you the
  best return.\n\n- Start using a good share portfolio management system such as [Sharesight](/)
  from day one. It's important to keep a good record of the shares that you own because
  you will need this information to file your tax return. It's also crucial that you
  can easily and accurately assess how well your shares are performing. Sharesight
  virtually eliminates the administrative work associated with owning shares. All
  the data you need for your tax return is provided automatically including your Foreign
  Investment Fund earnings if you are caught up in this nightmarish piece of legislation.
  And, best of all, Sharesight shows you the true, annualised financial return on
  your shares including capital gains, dividends and currency movements.\n\n- Have
  fun! Believe it or not, studies have shown that most DIY share market investors
  thoroughly enjoy managing their investments.\n\n<small>*This information is not
  a recommendation nor a statement of opinion. You should consult an independent financial
  adviser before making any decisions with respect to your shares in relation to the
  information that is presented in this article.*</small>\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
