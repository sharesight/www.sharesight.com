:title: What is the dividend payout ratio (DPR)?
:content: "Dividends are payments made by publicly listed companies to investors.
  The dividend payout ratio (DPR) is the amount of dividend that a company gives out
  to its shareholders as a percentage of its current earnings. Put another way, the
  dividend payout ratio measures the percentage of net income that is distributed
  to shareholders in the form of dividends. \n\nCompanies that make a profit at the
  end of a fiscal period have a few options on how they use the profit they’ve earned.
  They can pay it to shareholders as dividends (or indirectly via [stock buybacks](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-evaluate-and-record-stock-buybacks/)),
  they can retain it to reinvest in the business for growth, or they can do a combination
  of the two. The portion of the profit that a company chooses to pay out to its shareholders
  can be measured with the payout ratio.\n\n![Dividend payout ratio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3TlGub0ACGv27GqFVsDeMu/5e540fbe047e4a5e2db0d15853b791fd/Dividend_payout_ratio.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Dividend payout ratio explained\n\nThe [dividend payout ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendpayoutratio.asp)
  is an important marker for investors as it indicates which companies are paying
  out a reasonable portion of their net income to shareholders. Conversely, it helps
  to identify companies paying unreasonably high dividend percentages, which may attract
  investment in the short term but are unlikely to be sustainable over longer time
  horizons. It is also worth noting that companies without positive earnings can’t
  afford to distribute dividends to shareholders.\n\nTechnology giants Amazon and
  Microsoft are infamous for [not paying a dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/why-do-some-companies-pay-a-dividend.asp)
  for many years as they focussed on increasing the size and scale of their business.
  A good general guide for income-oriented investors is that smaller, fast-growing
  companies usually report a relatively lower dividend payout ratio as earnings are
  heavily reinvested into the company while bigger, more mature companies usually
  report a higher dividend payout ratio. There isn’t an optimal dividend payout ratio,
  as the DPR of a company depends heavily on the industry they operate in, the nature
  of their business, and the future business plan of the company.\n\n## How to calculate
  the dividend payout ratio\n\nThe dividend payout ratio that shareholders receive
  may vary significantly and depends on a range of factors like the maturity of the
  individual stock or company, the sector it operates in and the country it is listed
  in. There are a few [ways to calculate the dividend payout ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012015/how-do-i-calculate-dividend-payout-ratio-income-statement.asp)
  but the simplest method is to divide the total dividends paid out over a year (the
  sum of four quarters) and divide it by the net income, or earnings, during the same
  period. For example, if a company’s total profits were $100,000, and its dividend
  is $25,000, then the dividend payout ratio would be 25 percent.\n\nHowever, this
  would be on the low side as a dividend payout ratio of 30-50% is considered healthy,
  while anything over 50% could be unsustainable. A high payout ratio also implies
  that the share price is unlikely to appreciate rapidly. Because dividend payouts
  vary widely by industry, they are most useful in comparing like-for-like companies
  within a given sector. Real estate investment partnerships (REITs) in the US, [for
  example](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/102715/6-reits-pay-dividends-monthly.asp),
  are legally obligated to distribute at least 90% of earnings to shareholders as
  they enjoy special tax exemptions.\n\n## What does a high or low dividend payout
  ratio mean?\n\nA high DPR usually means that the company is reinvesting less money
  back into its business, while paying out relatively more of its earnings in the
  form of dividends. Such companies tend to attract income investors who prefer the
  assurance of a steady stream of income to a high potential for growth in share price.
  ASX stalwarts like Westpac, Coles and Telstra are good examples that [pay regular
  dividend income to investors](https://www.nabtrade.com.au/investor/insights/latest-news/news/2020/09/five_companies_with).
  By doing so, these companies foster goodwill among their shareholders, drive demand
  for the stock and signal to the market that business is good.\n\nOn the other hand,
  a low DPR suggests that the company is reinvesting profits back into its business.
  These are likely to be smaller, often rapidly growing companies reinvesting their
  earnings into the business to meet future growth and expansion targets. These types
  of companies tend to attract growth investors who are more interested in potential
  profits from a significant rise in share price, and less interested in dividend
  income. It is therefore crucial to review a company’s historical DPR to determine
  whether the company’s likely investment returns are a good match for the investor’s
  overall investment strategy.\n\n## How does DPR differ from dividend yield?\n\nA
  stock’s dividend yield is a different but equally important measure. The [dividend
  yield](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-dividend-yield-trap/) is the ratio
  of the dividend paid relative to the share price of the company's stock. For example,
  if a company’s annual dividend is $2.50 and the stock trades at $50, then the dividend
  yield is 5%. Yields for a current year can be estimated using the previous year’s
  dividend or by multiplying the latest quarterly dividend by four, then dividing
  by the current share price.\n\nAssuming the dividend is not raised or lowered, the
  yield will rise when the price of the stock falls and fall when the price of the
  stock rises. While dividend yield is the more commonly known and used term, many
  believe the dividend payout ratio is a better indicator of a company's ability to
  distribute dividends consistently in the future.\n\n## Track the impact of dividends
