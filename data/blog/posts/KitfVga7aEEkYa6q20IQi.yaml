:title: Australia's Top Fund Manager Picks for 2017
:content: |-
  Thanks to everyone who participated in our [2017 stock picking competition](/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition/). We’re busy tallying the top stock picks from [Sharesight](/) members, [Livewire](/blog/livewire-market-insights-within-your-portfolio/) subscribers and some of Australia’s top fund managers. As promised, we’ll create portfolios of the five most popular stocks from each group and share them with those of you who completed the survey (and opted-in to having the portfolios shared alongside your personal portfolios).

  In the meantime, you can get a sneak-peak into the professionals’ views on the overall market, including their top stock pick for 2017. The panel includes some of Australia’s top fund managers, including:

  - **Matthew Kidman** (Centennial Funds), **Chris Stott** (Wilson Asset Management), and **Ben Clark** (TMS Capital) -- the top three stock pickers from Livewire’s 2016 Outlook Series
  - **Steve Johnson** (Forager Funds) -- recently named as one of Australia's 'Best Young Stock Pickers' by the AFR
  - **Richard ‘Coppo’ Coppleson** (Bell Potter) -- author of Coppo Report and recently inducted into the Stockbrokers Hall of Fame
