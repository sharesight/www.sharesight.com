:title: International shares + manual entry now available!
:url_slug: international-shares-manual-entry-now-available
:content: "The latest good news from Sharesight is that we now support international
  shares! And that's not all. You can now manually enter investments that Sharesight
  does not cover (for example unlisted shares, managed funds, and shares on other
  international exchanges). \n\nBetter yet, this new functionality is available to
  all Sharesight customers at no cost - your subscription stays the same.\n\n## International
  shares\nSharesight now supports shares on the New York (NYSE), NASDAQ, and London
  (LSE) stock exchanges. You can now add these shares into your portfolio just as
  you would for an ASX or NZX share. Simply choose the appropriate exchange from the
  drop down list when adding a new share.\n\n![International Shares](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3fKdH6KgA0cGo0segWK6uk/31c2a354a4ef91da8e40f7c9325350af/international_exchanges.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Create and maintain your own instruments\nTo record an unlisted instrument or one
  that is listed on an exchange that Sharesight does not currently support, select
  'OTHER' in the 'Market' drop down box. To create a new instrument on the 'OTHER'
  market, ensure that the 'Add New?' tick box is selected.\n\n![International Shares](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1OvMTasMqgSyCGYwEsuUkM/8e03cdfc94488e866416fcee532fc736/create_instrument.png?w=950)\n\nOnce
  you have added a share on the 'OTHER' market you can manually record dividends and
  trades against it just like any other share in Sharesight.\n\nTo get up-to-date
  performance information all you need to do is enter the latest price. Simply go
  to the detail page and click 'enter a price' in the right hand sidebar. Click 'show
  prices' to view or edit historical prices.\n\n![International Shares](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/337AqjpIX6aCG4UO6eOgye/0a3e20e82becf76a98d5af1e062ceec9/maintain_prices.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  'Show Prices' page allows you to enter new prices and modify existing prices (simply
  click on the prices to edit them). This page also contains an '[Upload Bulk Prices](https://help.sharesight.com/import-from-csv-file/)'
  function which allows you to import a CSV file containing share prices (such as
  the historic price files that can be obtained via the Google finance or Yahoo finance
  websites).\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Help -- [Supported Stock Exchanges, Mutual
