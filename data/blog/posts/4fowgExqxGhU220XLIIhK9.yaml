:title: What is a franked dividend?
:content: "If you invest in Australian shares, you have probably heard of the term
  \"franking credits\" or “imputation credits”. Perhaps you have even received franked
  dividends, without fully understanding what they are or how they are calculated.
  This blog will explain how franked dividends work, the tax implications they have
  for investors, and how Sharesight can help investors [track dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  in their portfolio. \n\n![What is a franked dividend](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7EvuZW91YgNphRmll7Ut1r/12007b4af3177c2134a8383af010714e/What_is_a_franked_dividend.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a franked dividend?\n\nFranked dividends were introduced in Australia in
  1987, with Australia being the first country in the world to implement the regime.
  Franked dividends were created with the purpose of stopping the double taxation
  of company profits. Prior to this, a company’s income could be taxed and then the
  post-taxed dividends could be taxed at the shareholder’s personal tax rate. \n\nLike
  individuals, companies pay tax on their earnings, with a flat rate of 30% tax for
  large companies. As a shareholder, you own a very small part of that company and
  as such, are often entitled to a share of their profits, in the form of a dividend.
  If the dividend you receive, however, is taken from the company’s profits after
  tax, you won’t have to pay tax on it again, avoiding the company’s profit being
  taxed twice. A dividend that comes from already taxed earnings is known as a \"fully
  franked\" dividend. \n\nFranked dividends have what is known as a \"franking credit\"
  attached, representing the amount of tax the company paying the dividend has already
  paid. Franking credits are also often referred to as “imputation credits”. While
  a large company’s tax rate is 30%, the shareholder’s personal tax rate may be more
  or less, which is also taken into account. If your maximum tax rate is less than
  30%, the Australian Tax Office will refund you the difference in tax paid on your
  dividends. \n\n## How do franked dividends work?\n\nFranked dividends will be paid
  to you by the company which you are a shareholder of, should they have paid Australian
  company tax and decide to pay dividends to shareholders. Franked dividends work
  in the following way:\n\n1. Shareholders receive a dividend notice, within which
  they will find an item titled \"franking credits\". Franking credits are the amount
  of company tax that was paid on that dividend. \n\n2. The shareholder completes
  their own personal tax return, where they include both the dividend and the franking
  credit. \n\n3. The shareholder receives a tax credit at the value of the franking
  credit. This credit can be offset against any other income the shareholder has received.
  As the flat rate for tax of large companies is 30% and the personal income rate
  is generally less than that, franked dividends work out as mostly tax-free. \n\n4.
  As of the year 2000, any difference between the shareholder's tax rate and the tax
  paid on the dividend will be refunded to them.\n\nIt is in this way that franked
  dividends can not only provide you income but also provide you with a tax rebate.
  \n\n## What is a fully franked and partially franked dividend?\n\nWhile many companies
  pay franked dividends, it isn’t required of them to pay tax on the profit they redistribute
  amongst their shareholders. So while a fully franked dividend has had all the tax
  paid on it, you may also be given dividends that are partially franked or unfranked.
  In the case of partially or unfranked dividends, either some or none of the tax
  has been paid before the shareholder receives the dividend. \n\nFranking is given
  to the shareholder as a percentage. If a dividend is partly franked 50%, then the
  30% large company tax rate has been paid on half of the dividend, but not on the
  other half. \n\nPartially franked or unfranked dividends are usually the result
  of the shareholder’s company not making a profit during the financial year, or carrying
  forward previous losses, consequently lowering their tax rate. When either of these
  occurs, the company will be subject to less or no tax payments and as a result,
  dividends they pay will be partially or non-franked.\n\n## How do you calculate
  franked dividends?\n\n[Calculating franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/)
  for a fully franked dividend involves dividing the dividend amount by the company
  tax rate and then subtracting the dividend amount.\n\nThe [formula](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/franking-credit/)
  looks like this:\n\n*Franking Credit = (Dividend Amount ÷ (1 - Company Tax Rate))
  - Dividend Amount* \n\nThere are a lot of moving parts when it comes to calculating
  franked dividends, including your personal tax rate and that of the company in which
  you own shares. Sharesight automatically tracks the franking credits you receive
  with your dividends and allows you to run a [Taxable Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report/),
  which will calculate the impact of franking credits on your investment performance.
  \n\n### Example of franked dividends\n\nIf a shareholder received a fully franked
  dividend of $70 from a large company with a corporate tax rate of 30%, this is how
  their franking credit would be calculated:\n\n*$70 / (1 - 0.30) - $70 = $30*\n\nThe
  franking credit would be $30, added to the original $70, meaning the grossed up
  dividend would be $100. If the dividend was only 50% franked in this example, their
  franking credit payout would be $15. With a franking credit, tax only applies to
  the $70, even though the shareholder would declare $100 taxable income.\n\nThis
  may seem confusing, but tools like Sharesight are built to help Australian investors
  track their investment portfolios and simplify things like the ins and outs of [franked
  dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/). Sharesight also gives
  you a clear picture of your investment performance, including factors such as the
  impact of brokerage fees, franked dividends, and capital gains on your returns.
  \n\n## Are franked dividends taxable income?\n\nAll dividends you are paid as a
  shareholder are part of your taxable income. However, since the introduction of
  imputation credits in 1987, you can receive a franking tax offset for the tax the
  company has already paid on its income, which may completely or partially cover
  the tax payable on the dividends. \n\nFranked dividends can become beneficial at
  tax time, as if your income tax rate is lower than that of large companies, you
  may be due a rebate on the tax which was already paid on your franked dividend.
  \n\n## What are the benefits of franked dividends?\n\nThere are a few benefits of
  franked dividends. For the shareholder, they can mean that in some cases, your dividends
  are already taxed and no further taxes need to be paid on your share of the company
  profits. Franked dividends can also result in tax rebates if they were taxed at
  a higher rate than your personal income tax rate. Looking more broadly at franked
  dividends, since their inception in 1987, they have allowed Australian companies
  to better manage their capital, which in turn makes these companies more sound investments.\n\n##
