:title: Capital gains tax on shares in Australia - explained
:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only
  and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice
  and should not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIn Australia,
  when investors sell shares and other listed securities for a price higher than they
  paid, the profit or capital gain may be subject to a *capital gains tax*. Capital
  gains taxes are common globally, but Australia’s implementation is considered one
  of the world’s most complex, and the nuance in this regulation can have significant
  implications at tax time. As a result, investors need to understand how their trading
  activity during the year will impact their capital gains position in their tax return
  at the end of the financial year.\n\nThe amount of tax an investor ultimately pays
  on their capital gains in Australia depends on a number of factors, which are discussed
  in this article. This includes whether they are holding shares as an investor or
  trading shares as business, how long they have owned the shares, their marginal
  tax rate, and whether they also made capital losses. Broadly, investors need to
  include [all investment income in their tax return](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/CGT-assets-and-exemptions/).
  Tax on investment income is set at the investor’s [marginal tax rate](https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/).
  This includes what is earned in:\n\n- interest\n- dividends\n- rent\n- managed funds
  distributions\n- capital gains\n\n![Capital gains tax on shares in Australia](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7q295aDTCjKRDNCXSFWmgr/acf7a8c283e091ebee6066bd3ef90685/Capital_gains_tax_on_shares_in_Australia.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Capital gains or losses on investments in Australia\n\n### Capital gains\n\nIf an
  investor sells an investment for more than the cost to acquire it, they have realised
  a capital gain. This will need to be reported in their annual income tax return.
  Although it's referred to as capital gains tax (CGT), this is actually part of the
  income tax regime and not a separate tax.\n\nBecause capital gains are added to
  assessable income and are taxed at the marginal income tax rate, this may increase
  the tax an investor needs to pay and reduce the net return from investing significantly.
  As tax is not withheld for capital gains like it is for PAYG employee income, it
  is a good idea for shareholders to work out how much is likely to be owed on an
  ongoing basis and set aside sufficient funds to cover this.\n\nWhile investors need
  to include all capital gains in their tax return for the year they sell the shares,
  a discount applies for longer-term investments. Investments held for more than 12
  months are only taxed on half of the capital gain. The is known as the [capital
  gains tax (CGT) discount.](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/)
  Investors must also be mindful that capital gains can be offset against capital
  losses when calculating CGT, with investors sometimes adopting what is known as
  [tax loss selling](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  in order to *net out* their capital gains where practical.\n\n \n\n### Capital losses\n\nAn
  investor makes a capital loss on shares if they sell them for less than they paid
  for them. As noted above, it is important to be aware that a capital loss can be
  used to reduce the tax on a capital gain in the same income year. In some cases
  this loss can be carried forward to offset future capital gains.\n\nFor example,
  if an investor makes a capital loss in a financial year and doesn’t realise a capital
  gain, they can [generally carry the capital loss forward](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/capital-losses-on-shares-and-units/)
  and deduct it against any capital gains they make in future years. If an investor
  in shares makes a capital loss:\n\n- it can only be offset against capital gains\n-
  it can't be offset against income, including income from other sources\n- it can
  be carried forward to offset against future capital gains\n- it can't be converted
  to revenue losses in future years, even if you haven't been able to offset it against
  a capital gain.\n\n \n\n## CGT events affecting shares\n\nGenerally investors have
  to pay tax on any capital gain they make on shares or units when a *CGT event* occurs,
  most commonly when an investor chooses to sell shares they own. However, [a CGT
  event is also triggered](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/CGT-events-affecting-shares-and-units/)
  when the change of ownership of an investment is involuntary.\n\nOne example is
  when a company in which an investor holds shares is acquired by, or merges with
  another company. This may result in a capital gain or loss. A CGT event may also
  occur when an investor:\n\n- switches units in a managed fund to another fund\n-
  receives a distribution (other than a dividend) from a unit trust or managed fund\n-
  receives non-assessable payments from a company\n- owns shares in a company that
  has been placed in liquidation or administration.\n\n## Calculating the cost base
  of investments for CGT in Australia\n\nWhen selling part of a shareholding, where
  investors have bought multiple parcels over time at different prices, several factors
  need to be considered. Investors will need to be able to identify and nominate exactly
  when the shares of the holding they’ve sold were purchased to determine the cost
  base because this will affect the realised capital gain or loss and any CGT discount
  that applies. The [cost base of a CGT asset](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/Cost-base/)
  is generally the cost when bought by the investor, plus certain other costs associated
  with acquiring, holding and disposing of the asset. \n\nWhere an investor can not
  identify when a bundle of shares were purchased, the ATO allows for a [\"first in,
  first out\" (FIFO) method and average cost method](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/identifying-when-shares-or-units-are-acquired/)
  in certain circumstances.\n\n## Cost base using the FIFO method\n\nUsing the FIFO
  method means the sale of stock will be allocated to the shares the investor bought
  earliest.  \n\n### Example of FIFO method\n\nPaul bought 1,000 shares in ABC Ltd
  on 15 September 2012. He then acquired another 3,000 shares in the company on 17
  July 2015. In December 2015, ABC Ltd issued Boris with a CHESS statement for his
  4,000 shares.\n\nPaul then sold 1,500 of the shares on 27 January 2020 but wasn't
  sure whether they were the shares he bought in 2012 or whether they included the
  shares bought in 2015. Because he could not identify the particular shares he sold,
  he decided to use the FIFO method and nominated the 1,500 shares sold be made up
  for 1,000 shares bought in 2012 plus 500 of the shares bought in 2015. Paul would
  also be expected to keep a record of the composition of his remaining shares in
  future.\n\n### Cost base using the average cost method\n\nThe Australian Tax Office
  will also accept an average cost method to determine the cost of the shares disposed
  of if:\n\n* the shares are in the same company\n\n* the shares were acquired on
  the same day\n\n* the shares have identical rights and obligations\n\n* investors
  are not required to use market value for cost base purposes.\n\n## ATO methods to
  calculate capital gains\n\nThere are [potentially three methods](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/Working-out-your-capital-gain/)
  by which Australian investors can calculate their capital gains tax. It helps to
  be organised and have an exact record of when each shareholding was bought or sold.
  Here’s how the three methods may be applied.\n\n### CGT discount method\n\nGenerally,
  investors adopt the [CGT discount method](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/working-out-your-capital-gain/the-discount-method-of-calculating-your-capital-gain/)
  for investments held for more than 12 months, and the other methods for investments
  held for less than 12 months. Individual investors can get a 50% discount on their
  capital gains - once capital losses have been added - if they owned their shareholdings
  for more than 12 months before selling them. \n\n### Indexation method\n\nThis method
  is available to investors if the shares were acquired before 21 September 1999 and
  they have owned them for 12 months or more before a CGT event. [The indexation factor](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/working-out-your-capital-gain/the-indexation-method-of-calculating-your-capital-gain/)
  is worked out using the consumer price index (CPI) as a multiplier to account for
  inflation. This may be an option for investors who are carrying forward any capital
  losses for assets held before September 1999.\n\n### Other method\n\nThe ‘other’
  method is the simplest of the three methods for [calculating a capital gain](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/working-out-your-capital-gain/the--other--method-of-calculating-your-capital-gain/).
  This method is applied if investors have held shares for less than 12 months before
  the CGT event. This method is applied by subtracting the cost base from the capital
  proceeds, with the remainder being the capital gain (or loss).\n\n## Shareholding
  as investor or share trading as business?\n\nThe tax treatment of shares depends
  on whether the holder is considered to be an investor or carrying on a business
  as a share trader. The [ATO defines a shareholder](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/shareholding-as-investor-or-share-trading-as-business-/#Shareholdingasinvestment)
  as a person who holds shares for the purpose of earning income. For a shareholder:
  \n\n- the purchase of shares cannot be offset against current year income, but is
  a capital cost\n- receipts from the sale of shares is not assessable income. However,
  any capital gain on the shares is subject to capital gains tax\n- a net capital
  loss from the sale of shares can't be offset against income from other sources,
  but can be offset against another capital gain or carried forward\n- the transaction
  costs of buying or selling shares is not an allowable deduction against income,
  but are taken into account in determining the amount of any capital gain.\n\n\nOn
  the other hand, a share trader is defined by the ATO as a [person who carries out
  business activities](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/shareholding-as-investor-or-share-trading-as-business-/#Sharetradingasbusiness)
  for the purpose of earning income from buying and selling shares. For a share trader:\n\n-
  receipts from the sale of shares constitute assessable income\n- purchased shares
  are regarded as trading stock\n- costs incurred in buying or selling shares – including
  the cost of the shares – are an allowable deduction in the year in which they are
  incurred.\n\n \n## Sharesight’s Capital Gains Tax Report - built for Australian
