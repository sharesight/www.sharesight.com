:title: 4 reasons to stop relying on your broker’s performance reports
:content: "As an investor, it's important to know how your portfolio is performing.
  But when you log in to your broker's online portal to check your portfolio performance,
  do you know what those numbers really mean, and more importantly, what’s missing
  from them?\n\n![featured - 4 reasons to stop relying on your broker’s performance
  reports](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/53FTNZNtSAIrJfgnD1gZRd/64df6aefd0e1d0515979626690d373e5/featured_4-reasons-to-stop-relying-on-your-brokers-performance-reports.jpg?w=950)\n\n###
  Here are 4 reasons to stop relying on your broker's performance reports:\n\n1. [No
  annualised total return](#no-annualised-total-return)\n2. [Dividends are ignored](#dividends-are-ignored)\n3.
  [Brokerage fees are ignored](#brokerage-fees-are-ignored)\n4. [Currency fluctuations
  are ignored](#currency-fluctuations-are-ignored)\n\n## #1 -- No annualised total
  return\nOne of the biggest ways that brokers fail investors is with misleading performance
  reporting. That’s because they often only display the difference between the average
  cost paid for the investment, and the latest market price.\n\nFor example, here’s
  what I see when I login to my broker’s online client portal:\n\n![Scotiabank - overview](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5Ntsg947ley6ucyMKm82Kc/40307aaea5738965c67292ac4a6dbc63/scotiabank_overview.png?w=950)\n\n**That
  11% return is misleading because it’s really only telling me how I’m performing
  since the market last closed.** As someone investing for the long term, what I really
  want to know is:\n\n- ***How am I tracking so far this year?***\n- ***How does that
  compare to last year?***\n- ***What's my overall return?***\n- ***What impact are
  dividends having on my performance?***\n- ***How am I tracking compared to the market?***\n\nLooking
  at that report, I have no idea!\n\n## #2 -- Dividends are ignored\nSpeaking of dividends,
  my broker provides a transaction history which outlines the dividend income I’ve
  made on my investments. Here’s a snippet of that report:\n\n![Scotiabank - dividends](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2UjERaarrGAYoWGWWquGKK/4e1461b111d601de0d2217fd9cdac070/scotiabank_dividends.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  my case, I’ve opted-in to a [dividend reinvestment plan](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  (DRIP/DRP) which allows me to purchase shares using the dividend income I’ve made
  off my investments. I’m therefore buying additional shares at “no cost”, ie: I’m
  adding shares to my account without having to spend outside money and I’m not paying
  brokerage fees to acquire them. This factors into my performance, and yet because
  of my broker’s limited reporting, I have no idea how much.\n\nRegardless of whether
  I’m reinvesting my dividends or not, the obvious issue is that there’s no running
  total of these dividends on the report (or anywhere in my broker’s client portal,
  for that matter). **There’s no way to see how much income I’ve made from dividends,
  let alone understand the impact they're having (percentage-wise) on my total performance.**\n\n##
  #3 -- Brokerage fees are ignored\nIn the current investment landscape of [low-returns](/blog/5-ways-to-maximise-returns-in-a-low-return-world/),
  it’s really important to keep track of things that eat into your performance. One
  such component is the brokerage fees you pay to buy or sell investments. A $10 brokerage
  fee on a $1000 trade might only take 1% out of your actual returns, but it can really
  start to add up, especially if you’re a habitual trader. And unfortunately -- you
  guessed it -- **most brokers don’t factor brokerage fees into their performance
  figures.**\n\n## #4 -- Currency fluctuations aren’t factored\nIn this case, my investments
  were purchased with Canadian funds (and are part of my Canadian retirement portfolio)
  so I’m not being impacted by currency fluctuations. However what if they were purchased
  in USD or another currency? I’d have no idea how much impact the relatively weak
  Canadian dollar was having on my total return. Just like dividends, **most brokers
  don’t factor currency fluctuations into their performance figures.**\n\n![featured

  Start tracking your *actual* performance\n\nIt’s only when I started tracking my
  portfolio in [Sharesight](/) that I really began to understand what was going on
  with my investments. Here’s how I did it:\n\nFirst, I downloaded my buy/sell transaction
  history from my broker and uploaded it to Sharesight.\n\nI didn’t have to worry
  about dividends because Sharesight auto*magically* loaded them for me. While I could
  have just accepted the automated dividends, I went through each one line-by-line,
  and adjusted them where required to reflect what appeared in my broker’s transaction
  history. I found it oddly satisfying to be able to confirm every dividend, and I
  was amazed to see how accurate Sharesight was. Only a couple dividends were off,
  and only by a penny or so.\n\n![Sharesight - Recent Trades & Adjustments](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3FPptR9Zpm48em6K8GeGmk/0bd306cd1677668824afd3359a2571c3/sharesight_trades-adjustments.png?w=950)\n\nOnce
  I uploaded my trades and confirmed all my dividends, I was able to run my [Performance
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/) to see my returns over
  any period and answer those niggling questions I had earlier:\n\n***How am I tracking
  so far this year?***<br>I’m currently down <span style='color:red'>1.09%</span>:\n![screenshot
  performance angela 2018](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/Y6GtBOjhW84oequc0Iu6G/f9a5b221e46ed643a482f916e0b48aff/screenshot_performance_angela_2018.png?w=950)\n\n***How
  does that compare to last year?***<br>My return was <span style='color:green'>10.87%</span>
  last year:\n![screenshot performance angela 2017](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/26KpCFol1iCcY6o48yoMw8/04fd2c222dba47791f73ec3443f20247/screenshot_performance_angela_2017.png?w=950)\n\n***What's
  my overall return, and what impact are dividends having on my performance?***<br>Since
  buying these mutual funds 5 years ago, my total return has been 8.86%, with dividends
  contributing 9.27% of that return:\n\n![screenshot performance angela overall](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1rgCO1b6OcOWgeao6moyWk/4f6822fe2afcdcff21600196562ef5e3/screenshot_performance_angela_overall.png?w=950)\n\nThat
  led me to wonder how I had performed against the overall market. So I used Sharesight’s
  [Benchmarking](/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/) feature to compare my
  portfolio against VCN:TSE, a Vanguard Canadian “All Cap” index ETF. As it turns
  out, I’m beating it:\n\n![Sharesight - Angela Scotiabank portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/xstZqzowmWGuAieC4aIs4/835101f6d7b7af12681e02835428e814/sharesight_angela-scotiabank.png?w=950)\n\nThese
  are the types insights that really matter to investors but unfortunately aren’t
  provided by most brokers.\n\n## Why you need Sharesight\n\nUnlike most brokers,
  Sharesight:\n\n- **Calculates your total annualised performance over any period**,

  and currency fluctuations\n- **Lets you benchmark** your portfolio against any stock,
  ETF or managed/mutual fund\n\n![Total Return - Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3WBzR4oe2PObPiwzWTaib0/93557e5bfc3eaa0213a283506452fff3/total-return-sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n##
