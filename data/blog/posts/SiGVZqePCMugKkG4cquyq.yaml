  it on their terms. Sharesight is focused on adding value to the role of financial
  advice and wealth management professionals. And as CEO Doug Morris recently wrote
  at *Adviser Innovation*, “[now is the time for financial advisers to embrace fintechs](http://www.adviserinnovation.com.au/2017/12/08/time-now-financial-advisers-embrace-fintechs/).”
