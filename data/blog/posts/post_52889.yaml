:title: Tracking the fund managers' picks
:url_slug: livewire-portfolio-track-the-fund-managers-picks
:content: |-
  At [Livewire Live](/blog/livewire-live/), each Australian fund manager panellist was asked to make a stock pick for the coming year. We've built a [Sharesight](/) portfolio with their picks (and the picks from last year). Each buy trade was made the day of their pick and we assumed $10,000 invested in each company inclusive of brokerage costs. All dividends are reinvested.

  The picks from **2015** have had a full year to perform, and the managers made excellent calls. **Total (annualised) return is 32.43%, or a $10,062.31 gain:**

  We'll keep track of the portfolio's performance versus the STW, which tracks the ASX200. For the whole portfolios, the&nbsp;fund managers have outperformed the benchmark, 11.20% vs. -1.89% over the past 12 months (note: our [benchmarking](/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/) feature assumes that you’d invested equal amounts of money in both for the duration of the reporting period - more on this can be found [here](https://help.sharesight.com/interpreting-the-return-index-graph/)).

  Too early to assess performance on the entire portfolio, but we'll keep track and post periodic performance updates.
