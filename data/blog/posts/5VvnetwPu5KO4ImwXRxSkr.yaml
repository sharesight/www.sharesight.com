:title: How I manage my SMSF with Sharesight
:content: "Managing your own super fund can seem like a daunting task, but using the
  right tools takes away the guesswork and allows you to focus on cultivating the
  best investment strategy to achieve your financial goals in retirement. At [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/),
  we get a lot of questions about how to best set up a self-managed super fund (SMSF),
  so I thought I would share how I use Sharesight personally to centralise my SMSF
  portfolio administration, performance and tax reporting.\n\nI have a pretty typical
  SMSF, with a corporate trustee and two members – myself and my wife. I manage the
  whole thing using Sharesight connected with Xero, doing the bulk of it myself before
  getting audit and tax help from my accountant, who has a direct link to my Sharesight
  portfolio. It’s a very streamlined process that costs very little to administer
  and takes no more than a few hours a month of admin time. This means the bulk of
  my time is spent deciding how to best invest the fund – as it should be. \n\n![SMSF

  Tracking my SMSF in Sharesight\n\nMy wife and I are both still in the accumulation
  phase of our SMSF, but we are getting close to our preservation age. We maintain
  one Sharesight portfolio for the SMSF, with allocation to individual member accounts
  done via Xero at the end of the year. From an investment perspective, it’s treated
  as one portfolio with one investment strategy. \n\nAs for how we input this information
  into Sharesight, buy and sell trades for equities and ETFs are easily imported via
  a spreadsheet using the [broker import feature](https://help.sharesight.com/au/importing-your-trading-history-directly-from-your-broker/),
  while any managed fund transactions or unlisted private company investments have
  been entered manually, with trade confirmation PDFs or other documentation attached
  to each trade for record keeping purposes. Sharesight then automatically tracks
  all [distribution](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)[ and dividend](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  income received, as well as investment price and performance data.\n\n## Preparing
  the annual return\n\nAll SMSFs are required to prepare annual financial statements,
  [lodge an annual return](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/administering-and-reporting/lodge-smsf-annual-returns/#Paperform)
  and be audited. I manage my whole fund in Sharesight and Xero, as this creates a
  seamless solution between investment portfolio management and accounting. You can
  actually [synchronise](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/) your Sharesight and Xero
  accounts. This allows you to integrate details of share purchases, sales and dividends
  to Xero. You can also reconcile all transactions against the SMSF bank account,
  including super contributions which are automatically imported to Xero. \n\nBecause
  everything is reconciled along the way, there is very little to do at year-end before
  I hand over things to my accountant to review and complete. My accountant has access
  to the Xero ledger and makes all adjustments and year-end entries into Xero, which
  typically relate to revaluing the portfolio to the year market value, determined
  from my Sharesight portfolio value at 30 June. The accountant allocates all profit
  or loss to each member account based on our individual contributions and a pro-rata
  allocation of the fund’s investment profit.\n\n## Filing my SMSF tax return\n\nTo
  make tax reporting easy, my accountant has a [direct link](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/)
  to my Sharesight portfolio, and prepares the tax return based on the information
  in Xero and Sharesight. My accountant is currently using Class software to prepare
  the annual statements and the tax return from the data I have maintained in Sharesight
  and Xero. \n\nAll the information in Sharesight is uploaded to Class using the [All
  Trades Report](https://help.sharesight.com/trades_report/), which provides all the
  necessary activity in terms of trades. Class does a good job with the year-end compliance
  reporting and tax, and importing the data from Sharesight minimises any rekeying
  of information.\n\n## Tracking my investment strategy\n\nEach year, SMSF trustees
  are required to prepare a document detailing the fund’s asset allocation and investment
  strategy. Usually this isn't actually a very helpful document. It’s very static
  and often prepared long after the fact. With Sharesight I can actually continually
  track my performance against my strategy, rather than just at year-end. \n\nTo assess
  my strategy, I find Sharesight’s [Custom Groups](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  feature very helpful, as it allows you to apply your asset allocation targets to
  your portfolios by customising how your holdings are grouped. This can then be applied
  to reports that you run in Sharesight based on your investment strategy. For example,
  the [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  can be used to show a breakdown of your asset allocation, while the [Performance
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/) allows you to compare the
  performance of each asset class. \n\nBecause I invest outside my SMSF, I also need
  to ensure the investments in my SMSF are appropriate in light of my non-super investments.
  This is easy with the [Consolidated View feature](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/)
  in Sharesight, which lets you view the performance and asset allocation of all of
  your investments across all of your different portfolios in one combined view. For
  more on this, see my webinar on how I use Sharesight: \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ar0gI5ew7pE\"

  Sharesight\n\nPersonally, I find Sharesight an extremely effective all-in-one solution
  for managing my SMSF, tax reporting and non-super investments. The ability to see
  my portfolio’s true return and the effectiveness of my investment strategy at a
  glance makes it a powerful tool in managing my super fund. \n\nIf you’re new to
