:title: Announcing a partnership with Intelligent Investor
:url_slug: announcing-partnership-intelligent-investor
:content: "###### Note: this partnership has expired and this integration is no longer
  in place.\n\nWe're excited to announce [Intelligent Investor](https://www.intelligentinvestor.com.au)
  as a new strategic partner! \n\nIntelligent Investor provides independent research
  on ASX-listed stocks, model portfolios, educational articles, special reports, podcasts
  and a service where clients can get advice directly from analysts. They've been
  at it since 1998. In a conflict-ridden industry focused on selling bank-manufactured
  products, truly independent research is vital for all investors. Even more so for
  DIYs and SMSFs.\n\nWe're thrilled about this integration. One, it links [Sharesight](/)
  to a company providing a high-quality product. Two, it's exactly the kind of linkage
  that we constantly evangelise on this blog. Sharesight doesn't have plans to write
  investment research and Intelligent Investor was reluctant to build a portfolio
  tool. By focussing on our respective core competencies, building a link, and letting
  the client choose which applications to use, everybody wins. \n\n### How it works\n\n**Intelligent
  Investor clients now have the option to create a free Sharesight account with just
  a couple of clicks. When they arrive on Sharesight, we've built a customised version:**\n\n![Intelligent

  addition to mirroring their look and feel, we've also integrated their research.
  H = hold, B = buy, S = sell:**!\n\n![Sharesight & Intelligent Investor](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5ysCRIPMQgCA2siiIsImCE/be42eae2c59b9c1796f96e4a5b58c732/sharesight-intelligent-investor-1.png?w=950)
  \n\n**Hovering over your holdings will reveal your current weighting AND Intelligent
  Investor's recommended portfolio weighting:**!\n\n![Sharesight & Intelligent Investor](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3d5vUh7kMMOWO0iMWsAWQo/8f568dec1177b4368163a97700527f36/sharesight-intelligent-investor-2.png?w=950)\n\n**More
  integration awaits on the holding-specific pages. In addition to a link to the full
  research report from Intelligent Investor, we've pulled in a news feed of their
  research, analysts notes, special, reports, etc.:**\n\n![Sharesight & Intelligent

  unbundled (but linked) ecosystem of investing apps is now a reality, spanning the
  entire spectrum of requirements. With Sharesight's portfolio manager, you can link
  brokerage, accounting, financial advice, and investment research into a best-of-breed
  solution. You control how it works. You control which services you want to pay for."
