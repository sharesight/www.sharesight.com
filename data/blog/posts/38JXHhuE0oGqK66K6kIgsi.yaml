:title: Livewire Live portfolio – September 2016 update

:content: |-
  Back in June we attended [Livewire Live](/blog/livewire-live/), where some of Australia’s top fund managers gave their stock picks for the coming year. We built [a backdated portfolio of those picks](/blog/livewire-portfolio-track-the-fund-managers-picks/) and added the picks from the previous year.

  ![Livewire Live Portfolio 2016/09 - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2JLya9eeQ0ykueGWemKm4g/2e8e3ff4bcb8714f7d09101b1fa6f8ae/featured_livewire-live-portfolio_2016-09.png?w=950)

  It’s been 3 months since we last reported on the expert picks. So how have they done? Well, first consider that our benchmark the ETF that tracks the ASX200 (STW) is down almost 5% since our portfolio began.

  **The combined portfolio of both the picks from 2015 and 2016 is up nearly 20%, which equates to a gain of just over $18k.**

  ![Table - Livewire Live Stock Picks 2015-2016](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1jB7x7qnDYkgY6GWOMQOWS/b7600a9d91bd4c53bd198d519593f6dc/table_livewire-live-picks-2016__1_.png?w=950)

  The 2015 picks have shot the lights out, producing an annualised return of over 43%, generating nearly $17k on the initial $30k investment. Dividends account for just over $1,500 of the return.

  The top performer from the class of 2015 is Ben Griffith’s pick of Auckland International Airport (AIA), up nearly 55%.

  The 2016 picks haven’t fair as well, returning just 2.27%, or slightly more than $1k, with distributions responsible for nearly a third of this total.

  The best performing stock has been [Roger Montgomery](https://rogermontgomery.com)’s selection of Vita Group (VTG), returning almost 37%. The worst performer has been [Ben Clark](http://www.tmscapital.com.au/)’s iCar Asia, down 58%.
