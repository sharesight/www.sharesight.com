:title: My Summer of Code
:url_slug: my-summer-of-code
:content: "Hello there, my name is James Sullivan and I'm the newest addition to the
  [Sharesight](/) team. Since November, the team has hosted me as the Wellington [Summer
  of Code](https://summeroftech.co.nz) intern.\n\nLast year I was a fourth year Software
  Engineering student studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at Victoria University
  of Wellington. My commercial software development experience came from being the
  Summer of Code intern at [Xero](/xero/) during the summer of 2008/2009. The experiences
  learnt there and in previous jobs helped in quickly becoming a productive member
  of the Sharesight team. Most of my development experience had been more desktop
  oriented software with Java and C#/.NET, so being dropped into the world of Ruby
  and Ruby on Rails was quite a bit of an eye opener and I had to quickly get an understanding
  of how to use it appropriately.\n\nThe Wellington Summer of Code is an internship
  program started by John Clegg to match ICT students around Wellington with ICT companies
  around Wellington. This year was the fourth year it has been run and it has grown
  to well over a hundred students vying for positions at over twenty companies from
  small startups to large corporate and government organisations. Each internship
  is around twelve weeks of full time work covering various aspects of ICT.\n\nAt
  Sharesight, I worked on the development of a few new features that will make life
  easier and less stressful for the Sharesight customers. Here's an overview of what
  I worked on and some of the experiences I had while in the middle of it all.\n\n![James

  Trade Confirmation Emails importer\nThe [Trade Confirmation Emails Importer](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  is a new feature of Sharesight that will eliminate the need to record new shares
  as you buy and sell. This feature works by taking the Trade Confirmation Emails
  / PDF contract notes that you receive from your broker once a trade is completed,
  and automatically extracts the relevant trade data and records it into your Sharesight
  portfolio. Development of this feature was really interesting as we had to work
  with processes that already existed, while keeping any extra steps as close to zero
  as possible. The process of this development also exposed me to a somewhat different
  way of doing things than I had experienced in the past. \n\nSome of the interesting
  problems encountered included finding and creating a way to give as much feedback
  as possible to the customer should something not work during the processing of the
  Trade Confirmation Emails. For example, if the processing failed due to the contract
  note selling more shares then we knew were owned, then we could tell the customer
  exactly why the processing failed. On the other end, the processing may have failed
  for a reason that could not be easily defined so we would have to send a much broader
  email with several things to check. We also had to build it in a way that new messages
  could easily and quickly be added in the future.\n\nThe Trade Confirmation Emails
  import function is currently undergoing the final stage of user testing and is available
  to members of the [Sharesight Beta Group](https://help.sharesight.com/beta/).\n\n###
  Trades report and trade export function\nOne of the things that we have had many
  customer requests for at Sharesight is the ability to export all the trades that
  a customer has entered. The second project I worked on helps solve this issue, giving
  each customer the ability to export their data from Sharesight should they feel
  they need to. This was an interesting project that required me to look at the problem
  from the customerâ€™s perspective. This meant going through each step while thinking
  of the ways a customer would look at the information, links, buttons, etc. and build
  the report in a way that would be clear, easy and quick to use.\n\nDuring the development
  of the trades report, we researched the import/export formats of other related systems
  to ensure that the format we used in the trades report was broadly compatible with
  other similar systems.\n\nThis morning we made the Trades report available to all
  Sharesight customers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe internship has been an interesting
  and good learning experience. I have learnt a lot about the development of good,
  solid web based software solutions. You may even see another blog post from me in
  the future, as I have been taken on as a full time developer for Sharesight.\n\n###
