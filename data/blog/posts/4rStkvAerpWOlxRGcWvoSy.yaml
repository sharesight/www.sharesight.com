:title: What is a Listed Investment Company (LIC)?
:url_slug: what-is-a-listed-investment-company-lic
:content: "LICs are listed investment vehicles popular with Australian investors because
  they are both easy to access and offer investors several advantages over other \"investment
  fund\" type products like managed funds and exchange-traded funds. However, investors
  should ensure they understand the closed-ended structure of LICs before investing.\n\nRead
  on to learn about Listed Investment Companies (LICs), and the reasons why investors
  consider LICs as part of their portfolio investment mix.\n\n## What is a LIC?\n\nLICs
  are investment entities incorporated as companies and listed on a stock exchange
  like the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). These vehicles then invest in a diversified
  portfolio of assets, actively managed by professional teams on behalf of investors.
  However, unlike traditional managed funds, investors can buy and sell LICs in the
  same way other securities on the ASX are traded. A key feature of a LIC is the closed-ended
  structure, which means they don't issue new shares (or cancel existing shares) as
  investors join or leave. Instead, they issue a fixed number of shares in an initial
  public offering (IPO) and investors then [buy and sell these on the exchange](https://www.australianshareholders.com.au/listed-investment-companies).
  This ability to raise capital from thousands of investors at a single point in time
  differentiates the LIC structure from ETFs and unlisted managed funds, where investors
  may apply and redeem units at any time. As LICs are companies, they may pay franked
  dividends.\n\n## LICs compared to LITs, ETFs\n\nWhile LICs and Listed Investment
  Trusts (LITs) are both closed-ended structures, there are some differences between
  them − particularly from a tax perspective − which are important to understand before
  investing. ETFs, by comparison, are normally open-ended and new shares are issued
  every time a buyer makes an investment (and cancelled when the units are sold).
  This means the value of the [shares or units of a LIT or LIC](https://moneysmart.gov.au/managed-funds-and-etfs/listed-investment-companies-lics)
  can differ from the ‘true value’ of the underlying assets that it might hold in
  the portfolio, potentially giving LIC or LIT investors an advantage over ETF investors.
  Another difference is that while ETFs and LITs are trust structures legally compelled
  to pay out all income to their beneficiaries every year, LICs can ‘store’ dividend
  payments to smooth out income payments to its shareholders when markets are weaker.
  Finally, LICs are only ever actively managed while ETFs are traditionally passive
  index trackers, despite the strong recent trend towards active ETFs.\n\n## LIC costs
  and buying at the right price\n\nLICs are relatively low-cost investment options
  and fees are generally below those of comparable managed funds but more than ETFs,
  although investors in the latter will incur brokerage fees every time they trade
  an ETF unit. While investors should do their homework before any investment, LICs
  may require some extra research as they usually trade on the ASX at a price which
  is different to the net tangible asset (NTA) value of their underlying investments.
  The NTA is calculated by dividing the value of all the investments and other assets
  the LIC holds (less any liabilities) by the number of shares on issue. It is therefore
  possible for the share price of the LIC to [trade at a premium or discount to the
  NTA value](https://www.firstlinks.com.au/checklist-buying-lics-discount-nta). There
  is no one rule which determines the right price to pay, although investors typically
  prefer to buy LICs at a discount. Investors typically consider factors such as historical
  performance, dividend payout, liquidity of underlying assets, portfolio concentration,
  market value and the prices of similar LICs before committing. They should also
  be forewarned that they may struggle to find a buyer for a LIC shareholding that
  consistently underperforms, even if it is trading at a significant discount to its
  NTA value.\n\n## Benefits of LICs\n\nOne of the key features of the LIC structure
  is the ability to pay franked dividends. Because of their corporate structure, a
  LIC can retain earnings and reinvest them into the portfolio or pay dividends out
  of profits. This stable stream of franked dividends can be particularly appealing
  to investors, especially retirees, seeking reliable and tax-effective income in
  an environment of market volatility and low interest rates. Another potential LIC
  advantage is the ability to assist investors in diversifying their portfolios across
  asset classes, sectors and geographies that otherwise could be difficult to access.
  For example, there are [LICs that cover international shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/geographical-diversification.asp),
  emerging markets, specific sectors, and corporate bonds. This strategy has the potential
  to provide the best of both worlds to investors: active management that lifts returns
  and a consistent income stream that can make a big difference to portfolio returns
  over a long investment horizon.\n\n## Tax advantages/disadvantages of LICs\n\nLICs
  pay company tax on their income before distributing it to shareholders in the form
  of a franked dividend. This is generally at the current Australian company tax rate
  of 30%. If an investor’s marginal tax rate is below the corporate tax rate of 30%,
  they will generally receive a refund from the Australian Taxation Office for the
  difference. This is another key differentiator from managed funds as LICs pay tax
  and pay out higher fully franked dividends to investors. As a result, [post-tax
  comparative returns](https://www.firstlinks.com.au/lics-traders-vs-investors-tax-purposes)
  can understate the returns of LICs versus managed funds. A LIC paying a dividend
  will advise its shareholders how much of the dividend is attributable to a [LIC
  capital gain](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/CGT-listed-investment-companies-concession/).
  However, LICs tend to have a higher portfolio turnover than index ETFs, which can
  create an ongoing ‘tax drag’ from realising more capital gains each year. ETFs pass
  all dividends through to unitholders.\n\n## Future trends: LIC or ETF?\n\nLICs and
  ETFs are both very popular investment choices among retail investors in Australia.
  They have many similarities but also some important differences investors should
  be aware of. So, which one is right for your portfolio? Both investment options
  are [assessed relative to each other here](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/etfs-versus-lics-what-you-need-to-know/).\n\n##
