  November 2020 edition of the Sharesight20USA monthly trading snapshot, where we
  look at Sharesight users’ top 20 trades in US stocks on the Nasdaq, NYSE and [AMEX](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/)
  over the month. \n\n## Sharesight20 top 20 US stock trades November 2020\n\n![Top

  November’s Sharesight20USA snapshot, buy and sell trades were led by EV rivals Nio
  (NYSE: NIO) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which have both experienced strong growth
  over the past month. E-commerce giants Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:
  AMZN) also made the list of top trades, with Alibaba again posting strong Singles’
  Day sales while accusations of unethical practices at Amazon continue to burden
  the brand. At the same time, ‘Covid stocks’ Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) and Zoom
  (NASDAQ: ZM) saw large swings after analysts questioned whether their rapid growth
  will continue post-pandemic. \n\nLet’s look at the news behind the key stocks in
