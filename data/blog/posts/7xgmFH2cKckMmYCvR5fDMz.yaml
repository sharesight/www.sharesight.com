:title: How one financial advisor uses Sharesight Pro
:content: "We talk to Ryan Jones, Partner, Accountant and Financial Advisor at [Jones
  Louros](https://joneslouros.com.au), about how he uses Sharesight Pro to manage
  his clients’ investment trusts. Ryan also discusses how he uses Sharesight Pro’s
  [Xero integration](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/) to track clients’ net worth
  and streamline annual compliance, plus how Sharesight Pro adds value for his clients
  by giving them a true picture of their returns.\n\n![Ryan Jones Jones Louros Sharesight

  What made you decide to use Sharesight Pro?\n\nI was personally looking for something
  to give me a holistic view of my investments. I was listening to a podcast and heard
  about Sharesight, so I decided to sign up for a trial. I loved the Xero integration
  and the performance of Sharesight, so when I was looking for a platform for business,
  specifically to manage investment trusts, I decided to look into Sharesight Pro.
  I found Sharesight Pro really streamlined and much better than other platforms,
  which were too clunky. \n\n## How do you use Sharesight Pro in your business? \n\nAt
  Jones Louros we have a mix of clients: some are high end clients with investment
  portfolios between $50-$100 million, while others are family-run businesses, which
  I mainly deal with. Being both an accountant and financial advisor, I provide advice
  not just on a business level, but also a personal level, which I enjoy. \n\nFor
  any investment trusts we’re managing, we use Sharesight Pro. I have all the performance
  dashboards running through Sharesight and we give access to clients. The important
  point for us is the [integration with Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/). It
  helps with our annual compliance at the end of the year, which without Sharesight
  was a nightmare. It’s streamlined that process and made it so much quicker.\n\nFor
  individual clients, if they have a small portfolio with their broker, we’ll use
  Sharesight and Xero as well. We keep the personal balance sheet in Xero for those
  clients. Using Sharesight helps to feed those balances into the balance sheet, as
  well as dividends. We basically keep a net worth sheet in Xero for those personal
  clients. \n\n### How Sharesight Pro adds value for clients\n\nSharesight Pro gives
  our clients a holistic point of view in terms of their performance. Historically
  they might have only looked at capital returns and not taken into consideration
  their overall income – especially those on-platform clients (relying on their broker)
  who just don’t understand their true returns. With Sharesight, it’s already in front
  of them and they can see it straight away, which is hugely important. \n\n## Which
  feature do you find the most useful?\n\nI only just started using it recently, but
  I am finding the [Consolidated View](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/)
  feature really useful. Going forward, I intend to categorise clients’ investments
  based on risk profile, such as growth or balanced, so I can see how they’re performing
  against the other risk profiles. I have also been using the consolidated view with
  some clients who have self-managed super funds, personal investments and investment
  trusts. Getting a consolidated view of the three to see how they’re performing as
  a whole has been hugely advantageous. \n\nI also use the [Performance Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/)
  regularly. As I mentioned previously, a lot of people only look at their capital
  growth, but showing clients the income aspect of their performance with the Performance
  Report allows them to understand what their real return is. And the other big one
  for us, because we’re accountants, is tax compliance reports such as the [CGT Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/).\n\n<div
