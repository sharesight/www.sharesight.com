:content: "NZX-listed property companies Stride Property Limited and Investore announced
  a restructure of their entities to create an investment and management structure
  which is “fit for future purpose” and which will permit Stride to retain its PIE
  tax status while allowing its real estate investment management business to grow.\n\n###
  What the Stride Investore restructure means for investors\nUnder the Restructuring,
  Shareholders will continue to own all of Stride’s business and shareholders will
  retain their existing Stride Shares. In addition they will receive the same number
  of shares in Stride Investment Management Limited (SIML) these will trade together
  as a stapled security under the new name ‘Stride Property Ltd & Stride Investment
  Management Ltd’ (SPG). At the same time Stride will demerge Investore by distributing
  shares in it to Stride shareholders and certain eligible Stride shareholders will
  have the opportunity to acquire further shares in Investore during its IPO (Initial
  Public Offering).\n\n![Stride Investore restructure - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6v84khbtPGie6A68Os8MKa/a4ee420419a935417cdb35cfb0d26190/featured_stride-investore-restructure.png?w=950)\n\nFortunately,
