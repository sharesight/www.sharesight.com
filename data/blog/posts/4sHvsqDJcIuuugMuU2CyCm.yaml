  So you’ve realised that [your broker’s performance reporting is either inaccurate or non-existent](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/). And you decided to take matters into your own hands by tracking your investment portfolio using Yahoo Finance.

  Sound familiar?

  Admitting you had a problem was the first step. But when it comes to tracking the performance of your portfolio, Yahoo Finance is definitely not the solution to that problem.

  That’s because **Yahoo Finance doesn’t track** the impact of:

  - Dividends<br>
  - Brokerage fees<br>
  - Foreign currency fluctuations<br>
  - Annualised returns

  ...on the performance of your investment portfolio, giving you potentially misleading information that could lead to bad investment decisions.

  Like [Google Finance](/blog/4-ways-sharesight-is-better-than-google-finance/), the **number one issue with Yahoo Finance is that it only calculates your simple return** -- the difference between what you paid for the stock, and what it’s worth now. That’s bad because it doesn’t show you how you’re really performing each year.

  The only way to confidently track your performance is by using a purpose-built portfolio tracker such as [Sharesight](/). It provides you a **full picture** of your portfolio performance, tracking the crucial components missed by Yahoo Finance, and so much more (see *[Yahoo Finance vs Sharesight -- comparing portfolio trackers](/blog/yahoo-finance-vs-sharesight--comparing-portfolio-trackers/)* for more details).

  ## Importing your Yahoo Finance portfolio into Sharesight is easy.

  The good news it that it easier than ever to save/download a copy of your Yahoo Finance portfolio data and import it directly into Sharesight.

  Essentially **all you need to do** is:

  1. Download your portfolio from Yahoo Finance (as an .csv file)
  2. Upload it to Sharesight

  ![screenshot - sharesight + yahoo finance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2ElYy8d0xYAucYyAs4EcEC/53711c15313525e72aba3b0fd704699c/screenshot_sharesight-yahoo-finance.png?w=950)

  Don’t worry – you’ll be given the chance to review and edit your trade data. And once you’ve made any necessary adjustments, your Sharesight portfolio will be populated with your Yahoo Finance portfolio. This will allow you to:

  - **View your portfolio performance across various date ranges** -- something you **can’t** do with Yahoo Finance.
  - **View your *actual* dividends** -- unlike Yahoo Finance, which assumes you only own 1 share’s worth.
