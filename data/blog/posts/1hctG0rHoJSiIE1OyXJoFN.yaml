:title: 'Spotlight on the ‘S’ of ESG: The rise of social factors'
:url_slug: spotlight-on-the-s-of-esg-the-rise-of-social-factors
:content: "The integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is
  now recognised as a meaningful consideration when analysing long-term investment
  opportunities. Whilst the reflection on environmental and governance factors remains
  at the forefront of asset owners' interests, social issues such as health and safety,
  human rights, labour rights and equality have recently been pushed into the spotlight.
  Our [2020 ESG Manager Survey](https://russellinvestments.com/au/insights/esg-survey)
  showed an uptick in social factors, when compared to the previous years' responses.
  In this article, we explore the meaning behind social factors, as well as the risks
  and challenges when assessing these issues.\n\n![ESG Social Factors](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4qjaKfuhrIwysZtk1JHi0I/c09e4d73d7c9a3f784e1979ca2dcdd45/ESG_Social_Factors.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What’s behind the ‘S’ in ESG?\nWhen investors consider social factors, they analyse
  how a company manages its relationship with employees, suppliers, customers and
  the communities it operates in. These considerations can be broken down into internal
  social factors (such as human capital development, human rights and living wage)
  and external social factors (like animal welfare, social opportunities and product
  liability).\n\nToday, we are experiencing a more holistic consideration of ESG factors.
  This is helped by the rise of process innovation, specific ESG products and a greater
  attempt to capture metrics and data. While environmental and governance factors
  have been in focus for a number of years, the coronavirus pandemic, along with the
  Black Lives Matter movement, #MeToo movement and campaigns for equal pay, have increased
  the focus on social factors.\n\nWe are observing varying levels of sophistication
  within the investment community towards the greater integration of social factors.
  There are some clear outliers, both positive and negative, as well as the emergence
  of best practice principles. As an example, taking care of the workforce can be
  less tangible and harder to quantify but it is crucial not only reputationally,
  but for the long-term health of any business.\n\n## Social factors pose an increased
  risk for investors\nThe coronavirus pandemic has highlighted multiple examples of
  social failure. Across the globe, a number of companies were exposed as having poor
  social practices – as well as the opposite, revealing which companies have policies
  that embody long-term stakeholder values.\n\nResearch has shown that taking social
  concerns into account when investing, especially as part of a comprehensive ESG
  investing strategy, can protect investments in the long-term. A 2019 study showed
  that social criteria is important for risk management, with the results emphasising
  that high social standards could reduce a company’s systematic risk.1\n\nUltimately,
  we believe that companies with high social standards can react more robustly to
  developments such as inflation or periods of economic weakness.\n\n## The challenges
  investors face when incorporating social factors\nDespite the clear link between
  poor social practices and company risk, investors find it more challenging to incorporate
  social factors into their investment processes. While we are seeing an increase
  in metrics on how companies are assessed, due to variable data, it is still more
  challenging to assess a company’s social behaviour than the environmental practices.
  Currently, there is a lack of accepted practice and global standards for reporting
  by companies and there are gaps and inconsistencies in how social factors are measured.
  Additionally, there is no agreement on how much weight to place on these social
  issues.\n\nFor investors, the challenge goes beyond data. One of the key issues
  in incorporating social factors into an investment portfolio is that social factors
  have various meanings for different investors. During our 2021 Digital Summit in
  EMEA, a question was posed “what comes to mind for you, or the pension scheme that
  you are involved in, when you think of the ‘S’ in ESG?”. The responses showed a
  wide range of answers, with a large number mentioning diversity & inclusion, labour
  conditions or gender equality, but there was no clear majority overall.\n\nAsset
  owners face disintermediation between the time horizon that best suits an individual
  investor who is considering how to achieve their desired return, and that of their
  investment managers when selecting companies in which to invest. It is crucial to
  stretch these time horizons, if pursuing better ESG outcomes and greater alignment
  with investment outcomes.\n\nDespite these challenges, we believe that the incorporation
  of social factors in an investment strategy will imitate the path that we have previously
  seen in the development of environmental considerations. If the collective experience
  with environmental concerns is repeated with social issues, progression may take
  a number of years. At some point, we will likely start to see industry standards
  and frameworks emerge, which will help with an analysis of the issues highlighted.\n\n##
  Looking ahead: Will social factors rise in prominence?\n\nAs we look ahead, issues
  such as human rights, labour standards, and gender equality - and the risks and
  opportunities they present to investors – will continue to gain prominence. We believe
  that despite difficulties quantifying social factors, stakeholder-centric issues
  present real long-term risks for companies.\n\nAsset owners and industry practitioners
  will also need to take a leadership role and ensure long-term risks associated with
  ESG factors are consciously considered. A consistent approach in engaging with companies
  will enable them to take the steps required, both in their own interest as well
  as in the interests of wider stakeholders.\n\n###### Disclaimer: The above article
