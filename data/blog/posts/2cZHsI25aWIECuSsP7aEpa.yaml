:title: Top 10 portfolio benchmarks used by US investors
:content: "Sharesight’s [benchmarking feature](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/)
  helps investors track their success by allowing them to compare their portfolio
  performance to [over 170,000 stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)
  in the Sharesight database. This allows investors to zero in on their investment
  performance by benchmarking against an ETF that tracks a particular index, or a
  basket of stocks in an industry to get a like for like comparison for their own
  portfolio.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, we look at the top 10 portfolio
  benchmarks used by United States investors and how to add a benchmark to your Sharesight
  portfolio. \n\n![portfoliobenchmark US 0](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2nRXYcbQ5gulKKhqvvV36f/5a8ab6837bc70f8d40ec18d70fa6758d/portfoliobenchmark_US_0.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Top 10 portfolio benchmarks used by US investors in Sharesight\n\n1. [SPDR S&P 500
  ETF (NYSE)](#SPDR-SP-500-ETF-NYSE)\n\n2. [SPDR S&P 500 ETF (AMEX)](#SPDR-SP-500-ETF-AMEX)\n\n3.
  [Vanguard All-World ex-US ETF](#Vanguard-All-World-ex-US-ETF)\n\n4. [Invesco QQQ
  Trust](#Invesco-QQQ-Trust)\n\n5. [iShares Europe ETF](#iShares-Europe-ETF)\n\n6.
  [Vanguard S&P 500 ETF](#Vanguard-SP-500-ETF)\n\n7. [iShares MSCI ACWI ETF](#iShares-MSCI-ACWI-ETF)\n\n8.
  [Vanguard Real Estate ETF](#Vanguard-Real-Estate-ETF)\n\n9. [Vanguard Total Stock
  Market ETF](#Vanguard-Total-Stock-Market-ETF)\n\n10. [iShares MSCI ACWI ex-US ETF](#iShares-MSCI-ACWI-ex-US-ETF)\n\nIn
  choosing a benchmark, [many investors use ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)
  because they typically reflect the performance of a common index, without the costs
  involved in actually owning that basket of stocks. This gives investors a realistic
  indicator of how their portfolio would have performed had they bought into these
  stocks, without the effort of individually selecting and purchasing the stocks themselves.
  \n\nLooking at the most common benchmarks used by Sharesight’s US users, [SPDR S&P
  500](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy)
  (NYSE: SPY) is the most popular by far, which is not surprising as it tracks the
  performance of the 500 largest and most liquid companies in the US. \n\n![portfoliobenchmark
  US 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3YJCTxY6dxntkDT8cTYRHC/c17714125fcfc0a01bc23400c3b76711/portfoliobenchmark_US_1.png?w=950)\n\n###

  (AMEX: SPY) is the same ETF product as mentioned above, listed on the AMEX. The
  AMEX is owned by the NYSE but operates independently, which means prices for SPY

  [Vanguard S&P 500 ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VOO) (NYSE: VOO)
  is designed to track the performance of the S&P 500 Index, which includes 500 of
  the largest US companies. The returns of VOO are essentially the same as SPY, however
  VOO has a slightly higher growth rate than SPY due to its lower expense ratio. \n\n###
  <a id=\"iShares-MSCI-ACWI-ETF\"></a> 7. iShares MSCI ACWI ETF\n\nThe [iShares MSCI
  ACWI ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239600/ishares-msci-acwi-etf) (NASDAQ:
  ACWI) seeks to track the results of an index composed of large and mid-cap equities

  Index. It invests in stocks issued by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), companies
  that purchase office buildings, hotels and other real property.\n\n### <a id=\"Vanguard-Total-Stock-Market-ETF\"></a>

  includes a diverse range of small-, mid- and large-cap equities.\n\n### <a id=\"iShares-MSCI-ACWI-ex-US-ETF\"></a>
  10. iShares MSCI ACWI ex-US ETF\n\nThe [iShares MSCI ACWI ex-US ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239594/ishares-msci-acwi-ex-us-etf)
  (NASDAQ: ACWX) aims to track the results of an index composed of large- and mid-cap
  non-US equities.\n\n## How to benchmark a portfolio in Sharesight\n\nTo get started
