  In this Sharesight20NZX weekly snapshot of Sharesight users' 20 most traded stocks on the NZX, we see a continuation from [last week’s](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20nzx-weekly-top-20-nzx-trades-24th-august-2020/) trends, with a2 Milk (NZX: ATM) strongly leading buy trades in the wake of its [positive FY20 results](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/122491679/a2-milk-benefits-from-covid19-pantry-stocking-posts-record-386-million-profit) and announcement of plans to buy a major stake in [Mataura Valley Milk](https://insidefmcg.com.au/2020/08/23/a2-milk-plans-to-buy-majority-stake-in-mataura-valley-milk/). Sell trades were led by Cannasouth (NZX: CBD), which recently reported a [$1.45 million loss](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12360514) during the first half of 2020.
