:title: How to track dividend history using the Share Checker
:content: |-
  If you use [Sharesight](/) to track your investment portfolio, you might be familiar with the [Share Checker](https://help.sharesight.com/share-checker/). This handy tool lives within your portfolio and allows you to quickly check the performance of a hypothetical investment of $10,000 of any share, ETF or mutual/managed fund within a selected date range.

  ![Sharesight Share Checker - Telstra 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3Wergekal2HfHRlNbf8TyQ/95928aa43ff7258c2f25352a900ce292/screenshot_sharesight-share-checker-2019.png?w=950)

  ### The Share Checker provides:

  - A historical price chart
  - The EPS, NTA and P/E ratio
  - The country in which the stock is domiciled
  - Sector and industry classifications
  - The investment type and share registry

  And as with all [performance calculations](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/) in Sharesight, the Share Checker displays the total annualised return:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td align="center" colspan="3"><b>SHARESIGHT'S TOTAL ANNUALISED RETURN INCORPORATES:</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="33%"><b>Capital Gain</b></td>
      <td width="33%"><b>Dividends</b></td>
      <td width="33%"><b>Currency Gain</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The gain (or loss) in the stock price during the time period.</td>
      <td>The dividend income that was paid out during the period.</td>
      <td>The impact of currency fluctuations on the stock price if it is in a different currency than the portfolio’s <a href="https://help.sharesight.com/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/">tax residency</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

  ## Using the Share Checker to view historical dividends

  While the Share Checker is a great way to check the overall performance of any stock, ETF, or managed/mutual fund, did you know you can also use it to view all the dividends that were paid out during the selected time period, going back up to 20 years? Take a look at this short animation to see how to do it:

  As a bonus, if your portfolio has an Australian tax residency, you’ll even see the [franking credits](/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/).

  Looking beyond the dividends, there are additional tabs that display any corporate actions (such as mergers and splits) that occurred during the period, as well as recent news related to the stock from some of our [research providers](/partners/research-providers/).
