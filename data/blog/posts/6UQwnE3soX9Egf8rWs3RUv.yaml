:title: Diversification of SMSF portfolios post COVID-19
:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not
  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant to obtain
  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nThe past few months have seen many investors
  question themselves (and those they go to for advice) about how best to rebalance
  their portfolios – especially if their goals or financial circumstances have changed
  due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For SMSF trustees, [a portfolio review is critical](https://www.afr.com/wealth/superannuation/update-your-smsf-investment-strategy-20200529-p54xt4)
  during heightened market volatility to stay true to their investment strategy.\n\n![image

  balance of many portfolios will have moved in recent months with some asset classes
  performing better than others – especially with the rebound in shares since the
  March lows. Therefore, rebalancing may mean returning the portfolio to agreed upon
  investment ratios or target asset allocations determined during the initial portfolio
  design phase.  \n\nWhen a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) is set up, one
  of the first things trustees need to do is agree on and write an investment strategy.
  But this document is more than just a guide; it’s a mandate for the fund and trustees
  must abide by it. That means if asset allocations change due to significant market
  movements – as we have seen with COVID-19 and associated business disruption – trustees
  will need to [rebalance their assets](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/articles/insights/research-commentary/portfolio-construction/rebalance-your-portfolio-out-of-covid-19.jsp)
  back into line with the targets or ratios that have been chosen. More generically,
  investment goals may have shifted, along with risk appetite, as SMSF trustees age
  or experience changes in personal circumstances.\n\nAccording to funds management
  experts, a well-diversified portfolio should be rebalanced at least every six months
  … and more often in the face of a significant market correction. One of the potential
  upsides of a disciplined rebalancing process is that investors can ‘lock in’ profits
  and reinvest these proceeds into other asset classes. This assists with portfolio
  diversification while mitigating volatility and downside risks to the portfolio.
  A failure to periodically rebalance could leave the SMSF overexposed to one or two
  asset classes, increasing concentration risk.\n\nHowever, experienced investors
  will also be well aware that a disciplined rebalancing process incurs some costs.
  If equities are held directly, the main cost in selling down shares and buying other
  assets would be the brokerage costs and the potential for missed dividends. But,
  if managed funds are held for certain asset classes there may also be exit fees
  to pay, or income payments to forfeit. Another factor to be taken into account is
  that investors may be subjected to capital gains tax when shares are sold.\n\n##
  Learn from the pros\n\nBecause SMSF trustees face many of the same challenges as
  professional fund managers, it is worth considering how they rebalance their portfolios
  in a non-emotional, cost-effective and impartial way. Professional managers often
  enter into a legal agreement or mandate with large institutional investors that
  sets out how the money is to be invested. The mandate includes portfolio parameters
  around acceptable investments, style, strategy, risk parameters and an appropriate
  benchmark. \n\nFor individual investors or SMSF trustees, the advice from the investment
  professionals is to constantly monitor the holdings of their portfolio through a
  disciplined investment process and careful focus on dynamic asset allocation, tactical
  stock and sector selection, and portfolio rebalancing. Regular reviews with a financial
  adviser or investment professional can assess the efficacy of tactical asset allocation
  decisions, stock and sector selections, the market timing and implementation of
  investment decisions, risk objectives and the regularity of portfolio rebalancing.
  This may also be more urgent for a fund moving from accumulation phase into retirement
  phase as greater liquidity is likely to be part of the investment strategy. \n\nInvestors
  are likely to see prolonged periods of volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic
  with asset classes producing different returns that challenge traditional asset
  allocation assumptions. [The latest research](https://www.smsfadviser.com/news/19153-smsf-investors-maintain-steady-asset-allocations-amid-volatility)
  suggests SMSF trustees have responded to market disruption by taking a more defensive
  stance and increased their cash and property allocations. \n\nWhile bouts of short-term
  volatility are unnerving for all investors, they should remember that they are investing
  for the long-term. The best way to make a portfolio more durable and to mitigate
  risk is through asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. Overall, investors should
  always be mindful of striking a balance between risk control and cost minimisation.
  \n\n## Diversification without borders\n\nHaving sufficient liquidity, allocating
  strategically, being adequately diversified across asset classes and considering
  [tax loss re-harvesting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  are all critical ingredients for an investor’s long-term financial plan in the current
  market environment. While diversification does not always ensure a profit or prevent
  losses, it can potentially mitigate risk with some investments rising and others
  falling during episodes of heightened market stress. Like professional investment
  managers, SMSF trustees should diversify their investments across a range of asset
  classes, including styles (like growth and value), sectors/industries and geographies.\n\nWhile
  shares – both Australian and international – and bonds [tend to dominate most portfolios](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/072303.asp)
  some investors prefer the safety of cash while others like to free up liquidity
  to invest in other asset classes when opportunities present. Commodities, listed
  property trusts and alternative investments like infrastructure are other areas
  to consider.\n\nSpreading portfolio risk across different geographies should also
  be encouraged to avoid ‘home biases’ and concentration risk. This also means that
  if assets are located in a part of the world that is particularly vulnerable, the
  assets located in other areas will be able to compensate for any unexpected losses.
  The adoption of currency hedging and derivatives strategies should also be considered,
  where required, to avoid foreign exchange fluctuations and other unforeseen market
  events.\n\nDepending on risk appetite and age, investment advisers generally recommend
  a large allocation to domestic and international shares counterbalanced by fixed
  income, commodities, infrastructure and property exposures in order to generate
  decent risk-adjusted returns. \n\n## Track your SMSF diversification with Sharesight\n\nJoin
