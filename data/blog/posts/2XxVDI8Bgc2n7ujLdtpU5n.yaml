:title: ETFs vs managed funds - what are the differences?
:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only
  and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice
  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant
  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nAre you considering investing
  in an ETF or managed fund? When they’re both available, it can be confusing to determine
  which one is best for your circumstances. I faced this problem, and decided to do
  some research on the topic, and document what I found to be the key differences.\n\n![ETFs
  vs managed funds - what are the differences?](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4MF3YZK2PS5p58jKupwxM3/00f36201b34539e72683225acf94e0c4/ETFs_vs_managed_funds_-_what_are_the_differences_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What are the similarities between ETFs and managed funds?\n\nFirst, let’s look at
  what’s common between them.\n\n* **Ownership**: Both ETFs and managed funds are
  owned under a trust as a legal structure. The assets in the pool are unitised and
  the units are owned by unitholders.\n\n* **Diversification**: They both invest in
  a variety of underlying shares -- which is the fundamental premise of a pooled structure.\n\n*
  **Open-ended**: Both are structured as open-ended funds, which means as demand for
  these units increases, more units can be purchased. As the number of units increases,
  the assets under management (FUM) also correspondingly increase.\n\n* **Theme**:
  The reason an ETF or a managed fund exists is to achieve a certain stated objective
  for the investor. The purpose or why they exist could be common. For example, both
  the ETF VGS and the managed fund VAN0011AU have the same goal. Both are Vanguard
  products tracking international shares -- one is a managed fund (VAN0011AU) and
  the other is an ETF (VGS).\n\n## Differences between ETFs and managed funds\n\n###
  Management fees\n\nIn general, managed funds tend to have higher fees than ETFs
  because they are *typically* (but not always) actively managed, whereas ETFs are
  *typically* (again, but not always) passive funds that track a market index.\n\nFor
  example, when comparing the 2 Vanguard funds -- ASX: VGS and VAN00011AU -- as determined
  from their PDS documents, for a $10,000 investment, the ETF has a management fee
  of 0.2% pa whereas the unlisted managed fund has a fee of 0.90% pa.\n\n### Brokerage
  costs\n\nETFs are instruments traded on a stock exchange and therefore incur a brokerage
  fee to be paid to the online broker on which the buy or sell trade is made. These
  fees will eat to returns on the holding.\n\nManaged funds, on the other hand, when
  passively managed, do not have application or establishment fees, and typically
  no brokerage. However in some cases there can be opening and closing fees,and when
  bought through a wrap or platform, there are additional fees involved.\n\nTherefore
  if you intend on making regular contributions into the fund, then a managed fund
  will have cost advantages when compared to an ETF, which will have a brokerage cost
  involved for every transaction.\n\n### Minimum investment amount\n\nMost managed
  funds have a minimum investment of $5,000. ETFs are bought and sold just like shares,
  and so do not have a minimum investment threshold. However it’s important for the
  investor to ensure that the cost of brokerage on smaller amounts is not eating away
  a meaningful percent of the potential return.\n\n### Real time reflection of price\n\nFor
  an ETF, the price is a reflection of the performance of the underlying shares in
  the fund. This is computed in [real time and is reflected on the stock market](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/articles/insights/research-commentary/etfs/etfs-managed-funds-what-is-the-difference.jsp?lang=en).\n\nFor
  a managed fund, the NAV is calculated at the end of the day and is reflected in
  the unitised price.\n\n### Frequency of dividends/distributions\n\nIf you are an
  income investor, you need to check the frequency of dividend distributions. For
  example, when comparing the same two funds above, the managed fund pays dividends
  only twice a year, whereas the ETF distributes dividends every quarter. \n\nHere’s
  a comparison of the distributions paid by each fund over the last three years, as
  tracked in Sharesight:\n\n![image 0 (1)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6gut2cEWOI1VHs9nLbIWEZ/2a974fae0928d2e16b0ee2c9f9b89ebe/image_0__1_.png?w=950)\n![image

  Track your ETF and Managed Funds with Sharesight\n\nETFs and unlisted managed funds
  provide a challenge to the issuer and the taxpayer alike. If the fund manager is
  using an [attribution managed investment trust (AMIT) structure](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  this provides additional complexity.\n\nIn both cases, the tax admin is complicated
  and fund managers provide a one-time tax statement at the end of the tax year. These
  final statements contain all of the [component and subcomponent information](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/)
  for tax purposes. This information can *retroactively modify your cost base and
  taxable dividend income*, making your tax lodgement difficult without a portfolio
  tracking and tax solution like Sharesight.\n\n## Sharesight makes tax time easy\n\nJoin
