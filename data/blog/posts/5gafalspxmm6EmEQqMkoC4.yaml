:title: Snapshot of a global fintech
:content: "###### This post is part of Sharesight’s 10 year anniversary series. Scroll
  down to the Further Reading section for every post in the series or read [Sharesight’s
  10 year fintech journey](/blog/sharesights-10-year-fintech-journey/) post to get
  started.\n\nSince [Sharesight](/) was born 10 years ago, we’ve become quite an international
  company! Between the team, we work from 3 different countries, speak 11 languages
  (not including the dozens of languages our developers use to build Sharesight),
  and come from 8 different countries. We might actually hold more passports than
  Jason Bourne!\n\n![Sharesight - global fintech](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4e8ZfU3XBSYAGGAeKCmGYA/0fb5b881b5b2eaff4fe5c3be5a8f2ce1/sharesight-infographic_global.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Our clients are from all but one continent\n\nAnd our clients? We are so proud to
  have a userbase covering 61 different countries and spanning all continents with
  the exception of Antarctica. Funny enough, our very first clients outside of Australia
  and New Zealand signed up on the exact same day in June 2015 and they were from
  France and Singapore. That month, we also welcomed our first clients from 10 other
  countries. I’m sure it’s no coincidence because that’s when [we began supporting
  Global Markets](/blog/global-stock-markets/). Anguilla was the 61st country added
  to the list in February this year.\n\n![Sharesight - Global Client Map](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7mzF9v1gw8Eq66CAsQmWgS/1036c0d88b1e40d68ece0085be937c52/sharesight-client-map.png?w=950)\n<small>*Sharesight
