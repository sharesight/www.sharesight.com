  [Sharesight](/) has been awarded a spot on the [British Australian Fintech Forum](https://www.britishchamber.com/event/british-australian-fintech-forum) (BAFF) taking place in London from Wednesday 19th April to Friday 21st April.

  In competition with other Australian fintech companies, Sharesight was invited based on our ability to expand into the UK, our [company story](/about-sharesight/), and our disruption potential.

  According to the Australian British Chamber of Commerce, this is “a Fintech focussed business mission to the UK. Bringing together the Australian Fintech ecosystem across government, regulators, investors, start-ups and clients in London, the delegation will share leading practice with UK counterparts and support the business objectives of Australian business delegates."

  We’ll be joined by:

  - [AgriDigital](http://www.agridigital.io)
  - [Edstart](https://edstart.com.au)
  - [Neu.Capital](https://www.neu.capital)
  - [PayDock](https://paydock.com)
  - [Splend](https://www.splend.com.au)
  - [Timelio](https://www.timelio.com.au)

  The three-day event will also involve Amazon, HSBC, Ashurst, PayPal, Robert Walters, and Thomson Reuters.

  London is the fintech capital of the world so we’re looking forward to learning from our global peers, and leveraging the delegation to jumpstart our entrance into the UK market.

  And of course, we’ll do our best to represent Australian (and New Zealand) technology!
