:content: "Sharesight’s [benchmarking feature](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/)
  is a great way to track your success by comparing your portfolio performance to
  a market, region or industry of your choice. This feature allows investors to benchmark
  their portfolio against more than 170,000 stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or
  managed/mutual funds in the Sharesight database. \n\n![Sharesightbenchmark1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/eQnXAm9FQctkBuJSmLjGc/d407407695ae4776c2842c68eadd8274/Sharesightbenchmark1.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Top 10 portfolio benchmarks used by Australian investors in Sharesight\n\nWhen it
  comes to setting a benchmark, [many investors leverage ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)
  as these typically seek to replicate the performance of a common index, but are
  inclusive of the fees and costs involved in actually owning that basket of stocks.
  This also gives investors a realistic indicator of how their money could have performed,
  without the effort of picking stocks and building their portfolio.\n\nWe looked
  into the  most commonly-used benchmarks by Australian Sharesight users and unsurprisingly,
  ETFs featured strongly. \n\nHere are the top 10 benchmarks chosen by Australian
  Sharesight users:\n\n![Sharesightbenchmark2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4QzqHrjhSgKvw423Y4Fcax/8befd01e15a81e56c472445810558f2c/Sharesightbenchmark2.png?w=950)\n\n###
