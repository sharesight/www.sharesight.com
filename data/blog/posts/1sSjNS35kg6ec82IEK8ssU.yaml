:content: "I’m Tony Ryburn, Executive Chairman and [co-founder of Sharesight](/blog/these-two-reasons-are-why-i-founded-sharesight/).
  Around this time last year, I shared [my most rewarding investment](/blog/sharesight-co-founders-most-rewarding-investment/):
  helping to build [KES](https://keskenya.com), a school for disadvantaged children
  in Kenya. If you’re not familiar with the story, here’s last year’s video:\n\n<a

  data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"1\">KES - Sharesight co-founder’s
  most rewarding investment</a>\n\nMy wife Merle and I recently completed a visit
  to Kenya to visit KES. We really enjoyed interacting with the students, as well
  as their headmaster (and our good friend), Noah. Here are are few highlights of
  our time in Kenya:\n\n## Beach trip\nWe took the 40 poorest children that are kindly
  supported by donors (including Sharesight staff and clients), on a trip to the beach.
  **Although it is only a 35 minute bus trip some of the children had never been to
  the beach before.** To say they were highly excited would be a serious understatement!\n\nWe
  stopped a local roadside cafe along the way as most of the children had not had
  any breakfast. They each received 2 small, unfilled bread rolls which were rapidly
  devoured. They also received a drink to which most of them added the contents of
  the sugar bowls on the tables. Proof that kids everywhere can’t resist a sugary
  drink!\n\nThe kids thoroughly enjoyed the beach. Many were nervous about going more
  than knee deep in the calm water at first but most rapidly gained confidence and
  some were even persuaded to put their heads under the water.\n\n## Graduation day\nTwo
  days later it was the last school day for the year for our teachers and 220 children.
  A huge amount of preparation went into this and there were colourful decorations
  everywhere.\n\nParents were invited and it was very pleasing to see how many of
  them turned up as a major problem is persuading some parents how important it is
  that their children go to school.\n\n![KES Kenya School 2017 - 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5anbDWhUKc8SCQ6qoEkc82/f194dc2acf88934447d19f4da4c8b0b0/KES-Kenya-School-2.jpg?w=950)\n\nCertificates
  were given to the top-performing children in a very formal and ceremonial fashion.
  This was followed by colourful, entertaining skits and songs from the children,
  and speeches from teachers and others associated with the school, including us.
  We made sure we didn’t speak too long as we were aware that many of the parents
  know very little English and our Kiwi accents would not help!\n\n## Next steps\nWhile
  we were there, we had a meeting with local members of the KES ‘Board’ to initiate
  a strategic plan for the next 2-3 years. The board comprises experienced local people,
  including the headmaster of another charitable school, who are keen to help the
  KES grow and develop. KES is now well-placed to grow significantly without the need
  for significant additional capital expenditure. We’ll provide an update to donors
  when the 2018 budget as well as our longer-term strategic plan are finalised. \n\n![KES

  school year has now ended in Kenya and on behalf of Noah, the teachers and all the
  other local Kenyans who are working so hard to bring education and food to deprived
  local children **we would like to thank Sharesight staff and clients so much for
  your help over the past year**. Our visit emphasised to us yet again how desperately
  in need of help many of the children in this part of Kenya are. With your help,
  we will continue our commitment to helping as many children as possible get the
  education they deserve.\n\n## [Learn more about KES](https://keskenya.com) and please
