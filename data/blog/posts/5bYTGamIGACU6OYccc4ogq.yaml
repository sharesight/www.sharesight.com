:title: 2018 Sharesight stock picking competition - June update
:url_slug: 2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition--june-update
:content: "Last year we emailed [Sharesight](/) clients asking them to nominate one
  stock (from select markets) they believed would be the top performer for the 2018
  calendar year (January to December). We then constructed a Sharesight portfolio
  containing the nearly 100 stocks chosen, allocating $10,000 to each in the portfolio.
  \n\nWe’re approaching the halfway point in our 2018 stock picking competition. So
  six months in, which stocks are in the lead, and which have performed the worst
  in the competition?\n\n![featured sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2c0QkcckTOG6ogCOoSG0OM/4bfa658c0ff385d657680e730f455704/featured_sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How is the overall portfolio performing?\n\nAs at June 19 when our snapshot was
  taken, the Sharesight stock picking competition portfolio was down 2.9% sliding
  further from the 1.87% fall during the March snapshot. This contrasts with a 3.14%
  gain for the ASX200 index (using the [STW.AX Spdr 200 Fund ETF as a benchmark](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)).
  Again, this suggests that individual growth stocks that might be potential winners
  in a stock picking competition may not be the best to build a portfolio around.\n\n![Stock

  Cynata Therapeutics Limited (ASX:CYP)\n\nThe Australian based stem cell therapy
  company’s [stage 1 clinical trial success](https://smallcaps.com.au/cynata-therapeutics-second-cohort-stem-cell-trial/)
  has been followed up with news of [positive six-month data from cohort A in phase
  1](http://cynata.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/18.06.12.Positive-6-Month-Data-from-Cohort-A-in-Phase-1-Trial-in-GvHD.pdf).
  This has pushed their shares higher, up 114.52% for the year.\n\n### Altium Limited
  (ASX:ALU)\n\nThis Australian based PCB design software company has continued to
  surge higher throughout 2018. Despite a [7% single day drop in May](https://www.fool.com.au/2018/05/22/the-altium-limited-asxalu-share-price-drops-7/)
  the stock has returned 79.53% so far this year.  \n\n### Nearmap Limited (ASX.NEA)\n\nThe
  international provider of high resolution aerial imagery is up 75.53% for the year,
  with the company reporting a [27% increase in revenue from ordinary activities to
  $24.4 million for the first half of FY18, and a 31% increase in Annualised Contract
  Value (ACV) to $54.2 million](https://www.fool.com.au/2018/06/06/3-asx-tech-shares-to-offer-fang-like-returns/).\n\n###
  Xero Limited (ASX:XRO)\n\nXero has gone from strength to strength after [solely
  listing on the ASX in February](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/xero-shares-listing-solely-on-the-asx--a-guide/).
  The shares received a further boost after being [included in the ASX100 index in
  March (replacing Vocus)](https://www.crn.com.au/news/xero-added-to-asx-100-vocus-removed-from-list-486685).
  They’re up 61.06% for the year.\n\n### Auscann Group Holdings Limited (ASX:AC8)\n\nAfter
  being up 106.88% and in first place during March, Auscann has slid to ‘only’ being
  56.88% up at the halfway point of the year. Regulatory changes by the Australian
  Government to [allow medical cannabis exports](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2018-hunt003.htm)
  have helped keep the shares bouyant. Additionally, their [recently announced 1H2018
  results](http://www.finnewsnetwork.com.au/archives/finance_news_network168935.html)
  were well received.\n\n## 5 worst performing stocks in 2018\n\n![Stock Picking Competition
  Worst 5 Performers](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2sNzgXMaAoeIOSy6s6wmaE/70c98577b9293dced28e5720660d581d/Stock_Picking_Competition_Worst_5_Performers.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Blue Sky Limited (ASX.BLA)\n\nAfter being the target of [short seller Glaucus in
  April](http://www.afr.com/markets/behind-blue-skys-brutal-multiyear-war-with-short-sellers-20180406-h0yfa7),
  Blue Sky’s share price has tumbled significantly, taking out the worst performer
  crown in our June update with a total return of negative 89.27%. \n\n### Ookami
  Limited (ASX:OOK)\n\nAfter buying a ‘strategic equity position’ in [blockchain company
  Brontech](https://stockhead.com.au/tech/ookami-rockets-69pc-buying-piece-blockchain-biz-brontech/)
  in December 2017 (and pushing shares up 42% at the time), the stock has continued
  to slide from our March update and is now down 85.71% in 2018.\n\n### Retail Food
  Group (ASX.RFG)\n\nAfter [Retail Food Group’s horror performance in 2017](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-retail-food-group-RFG-shares-slashing-so-quickly-What-is-the-future),
  the fortunes of the company have not improved in 2018. The news in 2018 has continued
  to worsen, with the [announcment of the closure of 200 stores](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-05/retail-food-group-shares-plunge-on-store-closures/9509156)
  in March, and with the the group’s [managing director Andrew Nell stepping aside
  in May and Richard Hinson appointed CEO](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/embattled-retail-food-group-appoints-new-ceo-20180529-p4zi3s.html),
  RFG is down 77.13% in 2018.\n\n### DigitalX (ASX:DCC)\n\nAfter [posting a $10.4
  million profit in March](https://stockhead.com.au/tech/digital-x-continue-wave-bitcoin-hype-blockchain-enabled-grocery-poker-tech/),
  mostly on the back of gains on cryptocurrencies held by the firm, the slide in the
  value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has weighed heavily on the firm, now
  down 73.14% for the year.\n\n### TopBetta Holdings Limited (ASX.TBH)\n\nThe Newcastle-based
  Australian online bookmaker is down 67.5% for the year, despite announcing a $1m
  capital raise in February to strengthen their ability to meet future cash flow obligations
  and the [acquisition of data feed and bookmaker website DynamicOdds](https://www.punters.com.au/news/topbetta-set-to-acquire-dynamicodds_169737/).\n\n##
  Follow the 2018 Sharesight stock picking competition\n\nWe’ve made the [2018 Sharesight
  stock picking competition portfolio public](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)
  for anyone to view, removing the need to be logged-in to Sharesight to follow your
  stock’s performance against all other entries throughout the competition.\n\nEven
  if you don’t have a stock pick, this is an excellent way to follow the Sharesight
  competition. Bookmark the [2018 Sharesight stock picking competition public portfolio](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)
  to check back at any time.\n\n### 2018 Stock Picking Competition Notes:\n\nWe collated
  your responses (discarding invalid picks/typos/duplicates) and created a Sharesight
  portfolio with a holding of each share picked, with the following rules:\n\n- The
  2018 Sharesight Stock Picking Competition portfolio was created with a tax residency
  in Australia (with the performance of shares in markets outside Australia subject
  to currency effects) \n- We “invested” $10,000 in each holding, but did not include
  brokerage for matters of convenience here. (Sharesight factors the impact of fees
  when [calculating portfolio performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/),
  as [reducing portfolio fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092815/how-optimize-your-portfolio-and-reduce-fees.asp)
  can improve returns).\n- All dividends are/will be included in the total performance
  calculation, and are reinvested. \n- Performance figures are total return (versus
  annualised) as none of the portfolio positions has been held for longer than one
  year.\n- The winner will be the person(s) who picked the top performing stock over
  the period January 1st through to December 31st 2018.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
