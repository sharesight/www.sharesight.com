  Just as we finally got [settled after Xerocon](/blog/letting-the-dust-settle-on-xerocon-2013/) re-engaging and onboarding the hundreds of accountants we met, we’re packing our bags for the Xero Roadshow! We’re thrilled to be part of a select group of [Xero](/xero/) Add-Ons who’ve been invited to the Australian capital cities.

  ![Xero Roadshow Australia](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5UPYRhm7AWgyqWckeCmKew/4c21dd4064793d60485a5683875227e8/Xero-Roadshow.png?w=950)

  Sharesight will be presenting on the following dates/locations:

  - __Brisbane:__ Wed, 16 Oct, Sofitel
  - __Melbourne:__ Tue, 22 Oct, Crown
  - __Perth:__ Thur, 24 Oct, Novotel
  - __Sydney:__ Tues, 29 Oct, Hilton

  As the only investment specific add-on partner, we’re particularly excited by the noise Xero is making in the financial advice space. Not only does it make sense for planning practices to use Xero for their own books, Xero is perfectly suited to assist financial advisers as they help their clients manage their household budgets. We’ve seen a few live demos and we think they’re in a great position to change the industry. What’s more, when you add-on Sharesight to Xero, people will be able to visualise their entire wealth picture. Need to find out if that Telstra dividend payment will be enough to fund your Ashes 2013 tickets? The Sharesight and Xero partnership has got you covered.

  For too long financial advisers have been forced to use outdated, end-to-end software, which falls victim to the rapid development cycles those in the cloud space have come to expect. We can’t wait to see what Xero bringing their “engine + apps” model to the marketplace means for the wealth management industry. It should be easy for advisers to build a collection of apps, which are truly best of breed.

  This roadshow isn’t just for advisers. Xero has also invited accountants and bookkeepers and will be conducting training and providing the latest on partner and product updates.

  We hope to see you there!
