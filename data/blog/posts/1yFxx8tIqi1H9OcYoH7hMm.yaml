:title: Sync trades to Sharesight from Interactive Brokers
:url_slug: sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-interactive-brokers
:content: "Interactive Brokers clients worldwide can now automatically sync ongoing
  trades to their Sharesight portfolio simply by connecting their brokerage account
  using our [Interactive Brokers Integration](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=15491).\n\nOnce
  synced, Sharesight automatically calculates your portfolio performance, and factors-in
  the impact that foreign exchange movements, dividends, and corporate actions have
  on your investment returns -- giving you the complete picture of your investment
  portfolio (and tax).\n\nThis means you’ll spend less time on portfolio admin, and
  more time doing what *really matters* -- investing.\n\n## Interactive Brokers +
  Sharesight is built for global investors \n\nSharesight, sometimes called ‘the investors
  passport’, has always been built with the needs of international investors in mind.
  We make it easy for users [in over 100 countries](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/create-sharesight-portfolios-in-over-100-countries/)
  to get the full picture of their investments from over 40 stock markets around the
  world, all in a single place. So why did we choose to build an integration with
  Interactive Brokers?\n\nNot only has [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php)
  been rated Best Online Broker 2019 and a Top Online Broker for Nine Consecutive
  Years by Barron's, but they share our view of the global investor, one not bound
  by geography --  with the broker offering access to stocks, forex, fixed income,
  and ETFs in: \n\n* 125 Markets\n\n* 31 Countries\n\n* 24 Currencies\n\nTracking
  the portfolios of global investors like this is what Sharesight is built for, so
  this made our decision to integrate with Interactive Brokers an easy one.\n\nPlus,
  just like the [Sharesight’s partner ecosystem](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/)
  and [API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api), Interactive Brokers makes it easy
  to join a [growing marketplace of integrations](https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/MarketPlace.MarketPlaceServlet)
  that connect to and build upon their trading platform.\n\n## Why sync your Interactive
  Brokers account to Sharesight?\n\nNot only will your Sharesight portfolio be automatically
  updated with every new trade with Interactive Brokers, you’ll have more time to
  make the most of Sharesight’s powerful features: \n\n1. **Automatic price and dividend
  updates** -- Sharesight adjusts your holdings data with stock price & currency fluctuations
  and automatically incorporates corporate actions such as dividends and share splits
  into your portfolio.\n\n2. **Understand your true performance** -- Tracking portfolio
  performance isn’t easy. Brokerage fees, capital gains, corporate actions and currency
  fluctuations all factor into your performance. Sharesight’s [annualised calculation
  methodology](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/)
  provides data-driven insights to help you make better investment decisions going
  forward.\n\n3. **Run your own tax reports** -- With all your portfolio data in one
  place, and powerful tax reports such as [Taxable Income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report/),
  Capital Gains Tax, Unrealised Gains and FIF, Sharesight provides everything you
  need to figure out your obligations at tax time -- including the ability to [securely
  share portfolio access directly with your accountant or financial advisor](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/).\n\n##
  Connect your Interactive Brokers account to Sharesight\n\nConnecting your Interactive
  Brokers account to Sharesight to sync ongoing transactions is easy. If you don’t
  already have a Sharesight account, you can get started by [signing up for a free
  account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup).\n\nOnce signed up, you’ll need
  to request a custom username and password from Interactive Brokers to use with Sharesight
  so you don’t have to share your trading account login. Then you can connect your
  Interactive Brokers account within Sharesight.\n\n__Note:__ Read our [Interactive
  Brokers Integration help page](https://help.sharesight.com/interactive-brokers/)
  for specific details on how to request an integration login and connect your account
  to Sharesight.\n\nOnce you’ve connected your Interactive Brokers account to Sharesight
  with our integration, it should take about 24 hours to import your initial account
  data (you will have to backfill any historical trades not in the initial sync),
  with ongoing trades synced daily. \n\n## Become a better investor with Sharesight
  + Interactive Brokers\n\nNow that you can automatically sync ongoing trades from
  your Interactive Brokers account directly to your Sharesight portfolio, what are
