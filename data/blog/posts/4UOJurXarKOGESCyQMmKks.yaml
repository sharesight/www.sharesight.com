:title: Sharesight appoints Prashant Mohan as CMO
:content: "We are excited to announce that [Prashant Mohan](https://twitter.com/prashantmrao)
  has joined Sharesight in the role of Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) to drive the
  next stage of our growth. Formerly with Australian fintech startup Prospa, Prashant
  is the latest addition to the Sharesight team. I sat down with Prashant to find
  out more:\n\n![Featured Prashant Mohan](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7JKRsw3TpeaSI2kEcmasqy/c224d4a9ffe0dafb1dc00c408439554b/Featured_Prashant_Mohan.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Can you tell us a bit about yourself?\n\nMy career has been a non-linear one that
  has included experiences from technology (Infosys, Google), consumer product (Philips)
  and finance organisations (Westpac, Smartgroup, Prospa). I’ve also not grown up
  in marketing. I’ve been a software developer, a technical product manager, a business
  consultant and sales strategy manager before finding my way into marketing. What
  I love about marketing is that I get to use both sides of my brain -- the rational
  as well as the emotional side. I believe my key strengths come from a mix of data
  analysis, intuition, adaptability and collaboration.\n\nI grew up in an academic
  family -- both my parents were academic professors in Pondicherry in India. That
  grounding instilled my strong beliefs and personal values. My mother encouraged
  me to be adventurous and my father taught me to have rational and emotional logic
  to deal with the various uncertainties of life.\n\nDiversity of experiences in both
  my professional and personal life has given me a gift to understand people from
  all walks of life.\n\n## Why did you join Sharesight and what excites you most?\n\nBeing
  an investor myself, I had been a user of Sharesight for nearly 3 years. So, I was
  already convinced about the product and the need to use Sharesight  to educate myself
  as an investor.\n\n> I used Sharesight to track the return on my small portfolio
  of investments and I was blown away by how insightful the learnings were. As someone
  who believes that financial literacy and factfulness should be part of every adult’s
  life, I thought I would be able to genuinely touch and influence people’s lives
  and their relationship with their investments.\n\nSeeing beyond clickbait headlines
  and sweeping generalisations that are rampant in our society, I see Sharesight playing
  a key role in helping people experience factfulness.\n\nUltimately, it’s a nerdy
  mix of finance, technology, product and marketing and that resonated deep inside
  my soul.\n\n## You’ve worked for companies big and small. What are some of the differences
  working for a fintech?\n\nI value my experiences from both sides of the divide.
  Large organisations are very structured and give you frameworks for strategic thinking
  and developing a long-term strategy. What large organisations struggle with is execution.
  And again, there are exceptions to every rule. For example, when I worked at Westpac,
  one of my roles was to roll-out sales and operations strategy in regional banking.
  The environment was absolutely entrepreneurial and it provided experiences in small
  towns from Byron Bay in the north to Merimbulla in the south and Dubbo and Nyngan
  in the west.\n\nSmaller nimble organisations, on the other hand, are fantastic at
  execution, but can get carried away and excited by the prospect of “new sources
  of revenue”. So the strategic focus can be missing at times.\n\nI personally love
  working in smaller fintechs, you are able to continually listen to your customers
  to influence the product and organisation direction. \n\n## What do you enjoy doing
  when you’re not at Sharesight?\n\nI have 2 young kids and both are boys -- so life
  is quite physical. I love playing basketball with friends and the kids as well.
  As a family, we are all into cycling. I detox my brain by enjoying the great outdoors.
  We are lucky to be in Sydney with our great weather. We love getting into the mountains,
  bush and the amazing beaches we have here.\n\nI love reading books. I was an only
  child and so my parents encouraged me to read books. I read both fiction and non-fiction.
  One of my all time favourite books is Victor Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning”.
  It made such a deep impact in my grasp of what life is about and how one can deal
  with it under the most trying of circumstances.\n\n## Tell us something most people
  don’t know about yourself\n\nI am a failed theater actor. I love theater -- being
  on stage and living a different character is one of the most thrilling parts of
  theater. I say failed because I just can’t justify giving it time though I love
  it so much.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Sharesight.com -- [About Us](/about-sharesight/)\n-
