:title: How Sharesight calculates your investment performance
:content: "Sharesight is built by self-directed investors for the needs of fellow
  investors. By taking into account the impact of things like dividends, currency
  fluctuations and the timing of inflows and outflows on your investment portfolio,
  we provide a true view into your investment performance.\n\nIn this article we’ll
  explore in more detail how Sharesight calculates your investment performance and
  some of the ways we help give you the full picture of your portfolio.\n\n![How sharesight
  calculates your investment performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1NjFXySi3ttQCfGO5qUmWh/63a3b2d8a3f24f8869ec6ec270aa5769/How_sharesight_calculates_your_investment_performance.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Factors Sharesight takes into account to calculate performance\n\nCapital gains
  are only one component of your investment performance. Sharesight takes into consideration
  the following factors when calculating your total return:\n\n* Capital gains\n\n*
  Dividends & distributions\n\n* Currency fluctuations\n\n* Brokerage costs\n\n* Time\n\nLet’s
  take a moment to consider why each of these factors is important in giving you,
  the self-directed investor, the most accurate picture of your investment performance.\n\n##
  Component returns\n\n![Portfolio performance return components](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/58ywMjoFqyU8DWNNiwsCdz/02938a20b33995ca8ce2d9b86d4e3dd8/Portfolio_performance_return_components.png?w=950)\n\nThere
  are three key components to your total return. They are capital gains, dividends
  and currency gains -- which are all *annualised* (<a href=\"#Calculating-the-impact-of-time\">see
  below</a>).\n\nLet’s briefly look at each.\n\n### Capital gain\n\nIn investing,
  capital is the money you have invested in a particular holding, therefore in Sharesight
  the capital gain figure reflects the gain (or loss) resulting from movements in
  the underlying unit/share price.\n\n(Note: The capital gain figure in Sharesight
  can also include realised gains/losses on sales during the period, so it's not strictly
  just the change in the value of capital invested.)\n\n### Dividends\n\nDividends,
  also called distributions in the context of ETFs and managed/mutual funds are the
  income paid in return for being invested in a particular holding. It is important
  to consider this return as distinct from capital gains as many countries tax dividends
  differently to capital gains, in particular Australia, where [franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/)
  may also apply.\n\nRead our post on the [3 reasons why you need to be tracking dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  for more information.\n\n### Currency gain\n\nDid you know that more than 30% of
  Sharesight users on paid plans in Australia invest internationally? This means for
  these investors foreign exchange fluctuations will ultimately impact investment
  returns, and for this reason every Sharesight portfolio has a ‘home’ country residency
  currency that all investments are valued in. This means that international investments
  where the currency differs from that of the portfolio residency are converted back
  to the home currency at the prevailing intraday [foreign exchange rate (updated
  every 5 minutes)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/intraday-foreign-exchange-rates-now-on-sharesight/)
  when calculating the portfolio’s performance. This is also used for tax reporting
  purposes.\n\nIn a technical sense, the currency gain figure reflects the gain (or
  loss) resulting from movements in the unit/share price, much like the capital gain
  figure.\n\n## Brokerage costs\n\nWhile there are an increasing number of [brokers
  with zero-commission trading](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/brokers-with-zero-commission-trading-have-changed-investing/),
  for most investors, brokerage costs eat into their investment returns, particularly
  when the trade size is small.\n\nBrokerage fees, over the long term, can be surprisingly
  costly. For example, let’s say by trading with a lower cost broker, or buying larger
  parcels of shares less often, an investor saves $100 per year in brokerage. If that
  money saved was instead invested with a 7% return, that saving would compound to
  $10,200 over 30 years.\n\nTo measure the impact of brokerage costs on your investment
  performance, Sharesight allows you to record this cost against a transaction, adding
  to the cost base, or the purchase price for that holding.\n\nTo illustrate this,
  let’s look at a scenario where an investor buys a parcel of shares worth $1,000
  and the broker charges $10 to execute the trade for the investor.\n\n![Brokerage
  Costs Impact Returns](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/w3eivzcMG0ABHeqKWDJZQ/032544f482a6cbc4dc38b4e2f60850d8/Brokerage_Costs_Impact_Returns.png?w=950)\n\nWhen
  this $10 brokerage is added to the cost base of the shares, it will result in a
  cost base *higher* ($1,010) than the holding’s face value ($1,000), and if the investor
  then immediately sold this same parcel of shares (also paying brokerage on the sale)
  this will result in a capital loss.\n\n![Impact of brokerage on returns](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7KS38FsbfAFsrigbMl0Ixt/f5acb96f00120a36ee0eb8a22710cc79/Impact_of_brokerage_on_returns.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
  How brokerage costs on the above buy trade impacted capital gain/total return</small>\n\n##
  Calculating the impact of time\n\nThere are two distinct areas where Sharesight
  considers the impact of time on your investment returns. They are:\n\n* Annualisation\n\n*
  Timing/size of investment decisions\n\n### Why does Sharesight annualise returns?\n\n*Note:
  Portfolio annualisation only applies if you’ve held your shares for longer than
  one year. We apply a **total return** for investments held for less than one year.*\n\nAs
  a tool for self-directed investors Sharesight calculates returns using an [annualised
  performance methodology](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/)
  rather than simply stating the difference between the buy and sell (or current)
  price.\n\nAt its core, investors need to know how an allocation of capital has performed
  over the *time* that it has been invested. By incorporating the impact of time,
  it makes it easy to see not only your return, but your performance (*rate of return*).\n\nOne
  of the key benefits to this is that annualised performance makes it easy to compare
  the relative performance of investments (and your portfolio) over the same and different
  periods.\n\n(We explore in further depth why non-annualised returns can be potentially
  misleading to investors in our blog post (with real-world examples) -- [Cate Blanchett,
  queen of 100% investment returns?](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cate-blanchett-queen-of-100-investment-returns/))\n\n##
  Money-weighted rate of return\n\nThe performance of individual shares or funds in
  your portfolio is not the sole determiner of your overall portfolio performance.
  Your decisions to buy (inflows) and sell (outflows) particular investments also
  contribute to the return you have achieved as an investor.\n\nThis is because you,
  the investor control both the size, and the timing of cash flows into and out of
  your investment portfolio. If you time your trades to buy low and sell high you
  can generate a higher return.\n\nThus you may be interested in determining how your
  decisions to buy (inflows) and sell (outflows) particular investments have contributed
  to the returns you have achieved as an investor.\n\nFor this reason Sharesight uses
  what is known as a money or dollar-weighted rate of return calculation that factors
  both the impact of the size of investments and when they occur. This differs from
  what is known as a ‘time-weighted rate of return’ which is commonly used by fund
  managers to determine their performance (because they, unlike you, do not have direct
  control over fund in/out flows).\n\n![Money-Weighted Return](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5FjMegWtVK6QIQ8eSSIKU4/68f0e94dfc273c41abe67fedcec9abf0/sharesight_money-weighted-return.png?w=950)\n\nFor
  additional info, make sure to read our earlier blog post where we [explain the difference
  between time-weighted and dollar-weighted rates of return](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/time-weighted-vs-money-weighted-rates-of-return/).\n\n*Note:
  While there are various approaches to calculating money-weighted return, Sharesight
  uses a variation of the [Modified Dietz](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modifieddietzmethod.asp)
  method which has shown to provide a reasonable measure of performance even with
  large volatility of prices and periodical cash flows. See [Sharesight’s performance
  calculation methodology](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/)
  for more information.*\n\n## Simple vs Compound performance calculation method\n\nThere
  are two common arithmetically correct ways to calculate returns, and they can give
  quite different results. These two methods are the compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
  and the simple annualised return, or ‘non-compounding’ method. \n\nBoth methods
  are valid, but users should be aware when setting up their portfolio that Sharesight
  allows you to *choose* which method to use when calculating your performance - as
  this choice will lead to different results. This setting is available in the portfolio
  settings tab, or when first creating a portfolio. \n\n![Compound vs Simple performance

  an explanation of the difference between the two methods, read our blog post [explaining
  simple vs compound performance calculations](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculating-share-returns/)
