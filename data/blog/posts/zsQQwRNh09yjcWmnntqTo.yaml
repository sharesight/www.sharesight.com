  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant to obtain
  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nCompanies pay dividends to shareholders
  as a means of sharing profits and rewarding their investment in the company. Dividends
  are usually paid twice a year although not all companies pay dividends and, for
  those that do, this payout may vary from very generous to very little distribution
  to investors. Some companies may decide to retain their earnings for re-investment
  in growth opportunities instead. If a company does choose to distribute a dividend,
  then generally both the date and the amount is determined on a quarterly basis,
  after the board of directors meets to review the company's financial position and
  income statement.\n\n![image 0 dividends paid](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2DYhHtgek3Ja5X2ihwgT7B/49e2852f5d261eb038b0e66b3b91407c/image_0_dividends_paid.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  When do companies declare a dividend?\n\nTo determine whether they will get a dividend,
  investors should look at [two important dates](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/ex-dividend-dates).
  Depending on the country, these are the \"record date\" or \"date of record\" and
  the [\"ex-dividend date\" or \"ex-date.\"](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/ex-dividend-dates-and-their-impact-on-stock-prices-explained/)
  These dates refer to the date by which an investor must be on the company's books
  as a shareholder to receive the dividend and the date when investors need to have
  purchased the stock by in order to be recorded as the owner on the record date.
  \n\nIt is worth noting that a company's share price will [often fall by approximately
  the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/ex-dividend-dates-and-their-impact-on-stock-prices-explained/),
  which reflects that buyers from that date onward will not be eligible to receive
  that particular dividend. The payment date is, as the name suggests, the date the
  company pays the dividend to shareholders, usually four to eight weeks after the
  ex-dividend date. Finally, investors should be aware of the declaration date, which
  is the day a company officially announces its board of directors has decided to
  make a dividend payment in the future.\n\n## How are dividends paid out?\n\nDividends
  are usually paid in the form of a [dividend cheque or other form of payment](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102714/how-and-when-are-stock-dividends-paid-out.asp),
  but they may also be paid in additional shares of stock. In some markets, shareholders
  are given the option to reinvest dividends in the form of additional shares in the
  company, rather than in cash.\n\nIn the US, the standard practice for the payment
  of dividends used to be a cheque that was mailed to stockholders a few days after
  the ex-dividend date. These days paper stock certificates and dividend cheques are
  much less common as most investors hold stock electronically through a brokerage
  account. This allows any dividends paid by the stock held in a brokerage account
  go directly into that account, which makes tracking and accounting for dividend
  payments much easier for investors.\n\nSometimes a company pays a dividend in the
  form of stock rather than cash. This dividend may be additional shares in the company
  or in a subsidiary being spun off. The procedures for stock dividends may be different
  from cash dividends and it is best to research the specific rules for each market
  you invest in. Dividends are usually considered [taxable income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-ways-sharesight-helps-investors-at-tax-time/#taxable-income-report)
  regardless of the form in which they are paid.\n\n## What are Dividend Reinvestment
  Plans (DRPs)?\n\n[Dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/),
  sometimes referred to as DRIPs or DRPs, allow investors to reinvest their cash dividends
  in favour of acquiring new shares in a company. Sometimes companies will offer DRP
  shares at a discount to their listed share price at the time to encourage shareholders
  to continually re-invest in the company.\n\nGenerally, when investors buy shares
  in a company that offers a DRP, they are contacted and asked whether they wish to
  participate in the plan and advised how to go about doing so. Because a DRPs allows
  for direct acquisition of shares from the company itself, sometimes at a discount
  to the market value and with no brokerage fees, they can be very attractive to investors.
  However, there are [both pros and cons to consider](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-dividend-reinvestment-plans/).\n\nInvestors
  should also be aware that companies have the option to retract a DRP at any time
  so there are no guarantees that shareholders will be able to keep reinvesting their
  dividends or receive future dividends.\n\n## Types of dividends\n\nThere are [two
  main types of dividends](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/10/how-dividends-work.aspx):\n\nRegular
  dividends are the type companies pay out consistently over time as part of their
  recurring earnings. More established listed companies generally try to pay a regular
  dividend that they expect to pay out consistently, regardless of whether they’ve
  had a good or bad year. These are paid quarterly.\n\nSpecial dividends, sometimes
  referred to as an extra dividend, are non-recurring, ‘one-time’ payments. These
  are distributed by a company to its shareholders separate from the regular cycle
  of dividends and are usually far larger amounts than typical dividend payments.
  For example, a company might pay a special dividend after a string of highly profitable
  quarters or because it sold off some assets and doesn't have an immediate use for
  the money. Achieving a particular company milestone can also trigger a special dividend.\n\n##
  Which companies pay dividends?\n\nNot all companies pay dividends, but a large percentage
  of them do. For example, [roughly 80 percent of stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/why-do-some-companies-pay-a-dividend.asp)
  in the S&P 500 index of large-cap stocks currently pay a dividend to their shareholders.
  There are several accessible sources to help investors identify dividend-paying
  stocks, including brokerages that offer their customers screening tools, and a variety
  of online sources – from financial news media to investment research houses – analysing
  dividend data. \n\nMost countries compel their publicly traded companies by law
  to report all dividends they have paid to investors during the previous tax year
  on a quarterly and annual basis. As a result, investors can research these records
  on [regulator or stock exchange websites](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/dividend_stocks.asp)
  along with other financial information and operational disclosures. While there
  is no substitute for investors doing their own research, it is generally accepted
  that larger, slower-growing businesses are more likely to pay dividends than smaller,
  faster-growing companies, which need to retain their earnings to reinvest in their
  business and staff.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\nTax agents generally consider
  dividends to be income and investors will need to pay tax on them. This will also
  apply to shareholders who reinvest their dividends directly back into the same company.
  However, different countries have different rules and there are several other factors
  that must be considered. Dividend tax rate may depend on what kind of dividends
  they have and whether the shareholder is a resident or non-resident of the country
  where the company is listed.\n\nIn some countries, dividends may come with bonus
  tax credits, called [franking (or imputation) credits in Australia](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/).
  Dividends are paid out of company profits, and franking credits represent the company
  tax that has already been paid on those profits. These may have the effect of reducing
  the investor's taxable income. Investors on low marginal tax rates [may also be
  eligible to receive a cash rebate](https://www.asx.com.au/education/investor-update-newsletter/201805-how-franking-credits-work-and-who-benefits.htm?icid=O~C~~~~investor-update-lee~ASX~~201805~~)
  on all or part of their franking credits at tax time.\n\n## Track your dividends
