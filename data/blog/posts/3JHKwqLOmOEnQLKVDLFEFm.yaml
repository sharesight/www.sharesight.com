:url_slug: track-tel-aviv-stock-exchange
:content: "With Sharesight, investors can easily track over 1,000 stocks and ETFs
  on the **Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE)**. This is in addition to Sharesight’s support
  for [over 40 global ](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/)[markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/)
  including leading US markets such as the [Nasdaq](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-on-the-nasdaq-with-sharesight/)
  and [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-the-new-york-stock-exchange-nyse-with-sharesight/).
  Sharesight’s extensive market support allows investors from around the world to
  track all of their investments in one place, while providing them with powerful
  performance reports, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n![Track stocks on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange with

  What is the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange?\n\nEstablished in 1953, the [Tel Aviv Stock
  Exchange](https://www.tase.co.il/en) (TASE) is the only securities exchange in Israel.
  Known colloquially as the 'Bursa’, it hosts a wide range of securities including
  shares, bonds and ETFs, and provides services such as trading and clearing securities,
  remote trading and global clearing. As of August 1, 2019, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
  is a publicly traded company. \n\n## Why investors should track their investments
  on the TASE with Sharesight\n\nWith Sharesight, investors can easily [track the
  price and performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  of stocks, ETFs and funds listed on the TASE alongside investments across multiple
  global markets, brokers and asset classes. By consolidating all of their investments
  in Sharesight, investors gain a portfolio-wide view of their investment performance,
  benefitting from daily price updates for the TASE, plus advanced reporting designed
  for the needs of self-directed investors. In addition, Sharesight’s [annualised
  performance calculation methodology](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  gives investors the complete picture of their portfolio returns by calculating the
  impact of capital gains, brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and [foreign exchange rates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  on performance.\n\n### Track dividend income from TASE stocks\n\nUnlike other portfolio
  trackers, Sharesight automatically [tracks dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  and includes this information when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make an important contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the importance of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more
  than just capital gains in its performance calculations.\n\n![TASE dividend stock

  </small>\n\n### Run powerful performance reports built for investors\n\nFor investors
  who want a more detailed breakdown of their portfolio’s performance, Sharesight
  offers a range of powerful reports including:\n\n* [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/):
  Calculate your total portfolio returns over any selected period.\n\n* [Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/):
  Discover how the assets in your portfolio are diversified across different investment
  sectors, investment types, countries and markets.\n\n* [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/):
  Measure the impact of your holdings and asset allocations on your overall portfolio
  performance.\n\n* [Multi-Period](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/multi-period-report/):
  Compare your portfolio returns over different time periods.\n\n* [Multi-Currency
  Valuation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/):
  See the value of your holdings denominated in the currency of your choice. \n\n###
  Calculate the impact of TASE investments on your portfolio’s returns\n\nIn the screenshot
  below, you can see the [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  (sorted by market) being used to assess the ‘weight’ of various markets in an Israeli
  investor’s portfolio. This would be particularly useful for an investor looking
  to compare the relative contribution of their TASE investments to the total return
  on their portfolio, for instance.\n\nIn this example, the TASE (TLV) is the most
  significant contributor to the portfolio’s value, constituting 51.17% and ILS77,244.67,
  followed by the Nasdaq, constituting 46.51% and ILS70,211.65. The report also includes
  a detailed breakdown of each individual holding’s returns, classified by market.\n\n![TASE

  with Sharesight\n\n1. If you’re not using Sharesight yet, sign up for a [FREE account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  to get started.\n\n2. Add your holdings to your portfolio by searching for the relevant
  stock code under the market code **TLS**. Alternatively, you can add holdings through
  Sharesight’s [File Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  feature. **Note:** While TASE is commonly used as the market code for the Oslo Stock
  Exchange, it is listed under TLS in Sharesight.\n\n3. Sharesight will automatically
  fill in the price history and performance valuation for your holdings. It will also
  backfill past dividends (and continue to add new ones as they are announced) – plus
  factor in the impact of any currency fluctuations on your performance for international
  investors.\n\n![Add holding TASE](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2NEUzR3ONDcn2CNAZ2w1Si/de9884b27a1296121f58ec659766ec32/Add_holding_TASE.JPG)\n\n###
