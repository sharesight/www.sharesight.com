:title: Track stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKG) with Sharesight
:content: "With Sharesight, investors can easily track the price and performance of
  more than 10,000 stocks and ETFs on the **Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKG)**. This
  is in addition to key Asian markets such as the Tokyo (TYO), Shenzhen (SHE) and
  Singapore (SGX) stock exchanges, along with more than [36 other leading markets](https://www.sharesight.com/au/faq/#which-stock-exchanges-does-sharesight-support)
  including major US exchanges. Sharesight’s extensive market support enables investors
  worldwide to track *all of their investments in one place*, while providing advanced
  performance reports, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n![hong kong stock exchange](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/aTLRZWBTiEQc0GppnP7l1/a1f086231295defdf1fd6a2a9014a827/hong_kong_stock_exchange.PNG)\n\n##
  What is the Hong Kong Stock Exchange? \n\nThe [Hong Kong Stock Exchange](https://www.hkex.com.hk/?sc_lang=en)
  (HKG) was originally established in 1891 as the Association of Stockbrokers in Hong
  Kong, before being renamed as the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1914. The HKG is Hong
  Kong’s only securities and derivatives exchange, and is currently one of the world’s
  largest stock exchanges in terms of aggregate market capitalisation.\n\n## Why investors
  should track their investments on the HKG with Sharesight\n\nUsing Sharesight, it’s
  easy for investors to [track the price and performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  of stocks, ETFs and funds listed on the HKG along with the rest of their investments
  across different markets, brokers and asset classes. By tracking all of their investments
  in Sharesight, investors gain a portfolio-wide view of their performance through
  Sharesight’s advanced reporting built for the needs of self-directed investors.
  Investors also get the full picture of their returns with Sharesight’s [annualised
  performance calculation methodology](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/),
  which includes the impact of capital gains and losses, brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and foreign exchange rates when calculating performance. \n\n### Track dividend
  income from HKG stocks \n\nUnlike other portfolio trackers, Sharesight automatically
  [tracks dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and includes this information when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make the most significant contribution to this stock’s
  returns, highlighting the value of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more
  than just capital gains in its performance calculations. \n\n![image 1 HKG stock

  returns. </small>\n\n### Run powerful performance reports built for investors\n\nFor
  investors who want a more detailed breakdown of their portfolio’s performance, Sharesight
  offers a range of powerful reports including: \n\n* **[Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/):**
  Calculate your total portfolio returns over any selected period.\n\n* **[Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/):**
  Discover how the assets in your portfolio are diversified across different investment
  sectors, investment types, countries and markets. \n\n* **[Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/):**
  Measure the impact of your holdings and asset allocations on your overall portfolio
  performance. \n\n* **[Future Income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/):**
  View announced dividends and interest payments expected for investments in your
  portfolio. \n\n### Calculate the impact of HKG investments on your portfolio’s returns
  \n\nIn the screenshot below, you can see the [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  (sorted by market) being used to assess the ‘weight’ of various markets in a portfolio
  containing HKG stocks. This would be particularly useful for an investor looking
  to compare the relative contribution of their HKG investments to the total return
  on their portfolio, for instance. In this example, the HKG is the main contributor
  to the portfolio’s value, constituting 40.58% and AU$7,062.85 (or HK$42,303.67).
