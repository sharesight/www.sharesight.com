  The Sharesight development team took advantage of the holiday period to perform a variety of backend maintenance and housekeeping tasks, including a major database upgrade requiring a small amount of scheduled downtime (in all there were only two small windows of downtime totalling less than 15 minutes!). We also managed to ship a few enhancements here and there as detailed below.
