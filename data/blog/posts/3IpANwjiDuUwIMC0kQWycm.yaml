:title: Sharesight at the BDO National Business Services Conference
:content: "Sharesight recently had the privilege of attending and sponsoring the 2018
  BDO National Business Services Conference on the Gold Coast. \n\nPrashant, our Chief
  Marketing Officer, and I were both on the ground at the event, meeting and exchanging
  ideas with BDO Partners and Managers from across Australia.\n\n![Josh Rodrigues

  The Attractive Adviser\n\nThe theme for the event was ‘The Attractive Adviser’,
  and the key objective was to shift the mindset of BDO business leaders to focus
  on advisory services underpinned by digital thinking, adapting to change and innovating
  to create new service offerings.\n\n![BDO Attractive Adviser](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Eplgi8Zdikemgy8KOgCMc/f794dfe4a530ee746b321674777e2a98/BDO_Attractive_Adviser.jpg?w=950)\n\nJoined
  by a number of other amazing sponsors, including [Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/),
  Sharesight was able to really engage with the BDO leaders responsible for change
  -- including learning about the problems BDO faces, how the industry landscape is
  evolving, and discussing where technology can help drive BDO toward their goal.\n\n##
  BDO speed-dating\n\n![BDO Speed Networking](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6iuhTAxhdKieCsKIeukuG4/d8fd9dca190e4caa6dea8e5b53673c16/BDO_Speed_Networking.jpg?w=950)\n\nThere
  was even a speed-dating session, matching BDO leaders with the partners/sponsors
  they wanted to learn more about. Both parties came armed with questions, and it
  was great to hear about real client examples  (people still use [spreadsheets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  and [shoeboxes](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/tips-for-becoming-a-successful-share-market-investor-tip-17/)!),
  which allowed us to really drill down and highlight exactly where Sharesight can
  create efficiencies and better the adviser/client relationship.\n\nA massive thanks
  to the BDO team for such an enjoyable and engaging event, we look forward to joining
  you at the next one! \n\n## Unlock value for your clients with Sharesight\n\nSharesight
