:title: Why you should partner with Sharesight
:content: "The team at [Sharesight](/) was excited to be awarded the Excellence in
  Industry Collaboration and Partnerships (Australia) award by Fintech Australia at
  the [2017 “Finnies” awards](/blog/sharesight-wins-2017-finnies-award-for-excellence-in-industry-collaboration-partnerships/)
  earlier this year. Sharesight has also been included in [Fintech Australia’s ecosystem
  map](/blog/where-sharesight-fits-in-fintech-australias-ecosystem-map/) recently,
  so we thought this would be an excellent opportunity to dive into what makes collaboration
  in the fintech ecosystem so important to us at Sharesight, and why we believe it
  benefits both our customers and partners.\n\n<div align=\"center\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"

  charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n\n## Unlocking the value of open financial data\n\nFinancial
  services have traditionally been a fortress, one that locks up customers and their
  data.\n \nThose times are changing, fast. The “Rebel Alliance” -- an ecosystem of
  connected fintechs, is rapidly disrupting financial services, using the power of
  APIs to unlock the value of customers’ financial data, to provide an unbundled solution,
  one that does not require customer data to be locked in.\n\n## Horizontal Jenga
  blocks?\n\nSharesight CEO Doug Morris (who you can now follow on Twitter - [@Doug\\_Sharesight](https://twitter.com/doug_sharesight))
  explains it using Jenga blocks to illustrate the difference:\n\n>“If you think of
  traditional financial services as being a vertical column of children’s Jenga blocks.
  Fintech has disrupted the tower of blocks, toppling it over so consumers now can
  build their own financial services solutions from a marketplace to meet their needs
  -- just like an app store.”\n\nAt Sharesight we often see our customers assemble
  their own [“unbundled SMSF management solution”](/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  by bringing together a suite of fintech products at a price much lower than a traditional
  vertical financial services stack.\n\nSharesight believes in the power of APIs to
  build the horizontal financial services stack. \n\n## Delivering customer value
  with the Sharesight API\n\nSharesight maintains both the [Sharesight Connect](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api/1/overview)
  and [Sharesight User APIs](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api/2/overview) and
  we encourage other members of the [fintech ecosystem](/blog/where-sharesight-fits-in-fintech-australias-ecosystem-map/)
  to connect using these APIs in new and innovative ways to build value for customers.

  already use Sharesight’s APIs, and we’ve connected the Sharesight platform to [Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/)
  by using the [Xero API](https://developer.xero.com/) to further the horizontal financial
  services stack.\n\n### How are partners using the Sharesight API?\n\n>“We have partnered
  with Sharesight to enable portfolio tracking and tax reporting that is fully integrated
  into the CMC Markets Stockbroking platforms.” -- [CMC Stockbroking](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/platform/stockbroking-platform/tax-portfolio-reporting).\n\n![CMC
