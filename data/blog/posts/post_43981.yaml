:title: How smart advisers are leveraging disruption
:url_slug: how-smart-advisers-are-leveraging-disruption
:content: "During August we travelled around the country with ASX. They were doing
  an educational tour for financial advisers on [mFund](https://www.asx.com.au/mfund/),
  their product that lets DIY & professional investors access what used to be unlisted
  managed funds. They invited us to explain how advisers can track and administer
  mFunds off-platform.\n\nEssentially, mFund lets anyone buy and sell managed funds
  via an online broker (which [can be tracked](/blog/asx-mfund-now-available-on-sharesight/)
  on [Sharesight](/)). With about 100 options available from some of the best-known
  fund managers, we think this service is going to be massively popular.\n\n![Smart
  Advisers - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/HP8eDbbyakyo4CC4aKwmU/393bddfba74e0f8f107a665f93c050bc/featured_smart-advisers.jpg?w=950)\n\nFinancial
  advisers are moving away from platforms and wraps for various reasons. As they move
  towards fee for service, they're looking for more flexibility, better software,
  and clients are demanding lower fees of course. They're searching for ways to decouple
  investment selection, execution, and reporting. But with decoupling comes disruption.\n\nFor
  the fund managers, eventually just being listed on a platform will no longer mean
  guaranteed inflows. They'll begin to market their funds (i.e. mFunds) directly to
  investors. Some US-based managers have gotten really good at this. Fidelity, for
  example is just as much an online broker as they are a fund manager. They've also
  launched a roboadvice offering.\n\n## Where does this leave financial advisers?\nIn
  a great position to prove their worth. According to ASX, 60% of the mFund trades
  have been placed by financial advisers on behalf of their clients.\n\nmFund is a
  story about low cost access to active management, which is why it's also a story
  about manager selection and asset allocation - areas where most people need an adviser's
  help. One theme ASX has been concentrating on is diversification. With all these
  active managers now available to advisers outside of the traditional platform structure,
  they can bring new ideas to their clients.\n\nAnd advisers need new ideas to generate
  new streams of revenue. \n\nWe took a look at the top 10 holdings for DIY and professionally
  managed portfolios on Sharesight. We're not arguing that these companies don't belong
  in your portfolio, but it could be argued that it's becoming difficult for financial
  advisers to sell a well-worn story that's widely available to retail investors via
  ETFs. And harder still in a small, concentrated market like the ASX.\n\n![Table
  - top 10 holdings](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/FE1pSgVvGuIAsAISOiqoc/530c924b9d19c68dd6616e97661005c5/table_top-10-holdings.png?w=950)\n\nThose
  lists are awfully similar. Forget country or sector exposure, that's almost the
  same weightings in individual companies!\n\nMy bet is that a similar story played
  out with ETFs. Once thought of as watered-down index option for mum and dads is
  now tactically wielded by advisers and institutions alike. In the States, advisers
  send more client money to ETFs than mutual funds.\n\nIt's good to see switched on
  advisers taking advantage of a welcomed addition to the investing landscape. The
  advisers we spoke with during the roadshow are just as excited about new, low cost
  offerings as our die-hard DIY clients.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Blog -- [Announcing
