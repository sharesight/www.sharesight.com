  but Sharesight makes it easy to access award-winning performance and tax reporting
  with the ability to [automatically import trades](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  to Sharesight via email. A convenient way of keeping your portfolio up to date,
  this means users can spend more time focusing on their investments, not entering
  data. \n\nTo learn how to import trades through Trade Confirmation Emails, and why
  the [Trade Confirmation Emails Inbox](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/contract-notes-inbox/)
  is such a useful feature for Sharesight users, keep reading. \n\n![image 0 tradeconfirmations](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/JaZQKduJIyAltgCVdXUjl/cde183e7c701aa006fbbd75dd55780a8/image_0_tradeconfirmations.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Support for over 200 brokers worldwide (and growing) \n\nSharesight supports [more
  than 200 brokers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/supported-brokers-global/) from
  around the world, including major brokers such as [CommSec (Australia)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/easily-track-trades-with-commsec-using-sharesight/),
  [ASB Securities](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/easily-import-asb-securities-trades-into-sharesight/)[

  (Worldwide)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-saxo-markets/)
  to name just a few, with more brokers added on a regular basis. \n\n## How to import
  trades via email to Sharesight\n\nIt’s easy for investors to use Sharesight’s Trade
  Confirmation Emails feature to automatically add buy and sell trades from their
  brokerage account (or multiple brokerage accounts) to a Sharesight portfolio. \n\nTo
  use this feature, first ensure your broker is [supported by Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/).
  Then find the unique Portfolio Email Address linked to your Sharesight portfolio
  by visiting the ‘Integrations’ tab on your Sharesight portfolio and click on ‘Trade
  Confirmation Emails’. \n\nYou can then either instruct your broker to email a copy
  of your trade confirmations directly to this email address or [manually forward
  the trade confirmations](https://help.sharesight.com/au/manually-forwarding-broker-contract-notes-to-sharesight/)
  from your broker to Sharesight. \n\n![image 1 tradeconfirmations](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/0P07uElvgh38mV682LVdj/70ed365fa4805bfb4d7aa4a9bddd6572/image_1_tradeconfirmations.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
  Use the Portfolio Email Address linked to your Sharesight portfolio to automatically
  add trades from your broker. </small>\n\n**Note:** This feature is designed primarily
  for ongoing trades, but it can also be used to fill in historical trades in your
  Sharesight portfolio. All you need to do is manually forward the Trade Confirmation
  Emails for the trades you wish to see in your portfolio, starting with the earliest
  trade you want included.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GKT6_A3LgMw\"

  Emails inbox\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmations Inbox](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/contract-notes-inbox/)
  is a useful feature that allows users to view the status of all Trade Confirmation
  Emails that have been sent to their account, including whether they have been successful
  or if they have failed. This allows users to review their confirmations and ensure
  the data is correct. \n\n![image 2 tradeconfirmations](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3YjrCWNDdbXyDnpgSXjepC/427e22f22dcdb4cb73af1f51b0e40be6/image_2_tradeconfirmations.jpg?w=950)\n\n<small>
  A Trade Confirmation Emails Inbox with a trade that was unable to be processed by
  Sharesight. </small>\n\nFor any Trade Confirmation Emails that fail to process,
  Sharesight users can have a copy of the confirmation sent to their email, making
  it easy to identify the exact trade/s that have failed. Reasons a Trade Confirmation
  Email may be unable to be processed by Sharesight include missing information, unreadable
  formatting or duplicate confirmations, for example. \n\n![image 3 tradeconfirmations](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/XZo7K2jdIXC4GOtV8kXmu/2285a0a39873a7bf03dcf7e35ce4705d/image_3_tradeconfirmations.jpg?w=950)\n\n<small>

  </small> \n\n## Help add support for your broker to Sharesight\n\nIf your broker
  is not yet supported by Sharesight, you can request we add support for them, provided
  they supply emailed or downloadable PDF trade confirmations. All you need to do
  is contact us by sending our support team a message when logged into your Sharesight
  account. All we need to add a new broker is some sample buy and sell trade confirmations
  (email or PDF), the email the broker sends them from and the subject line of the
  emails.\n\n## Sharesight takes the headache out of tracking your investment performance\n\nNot
