:title: Who’s to blame for the financial meltdown?
:url_slug: whos-to-blame-for-the-financial-meltdown
:content: "As an investor in the share markets, I’m keen to discover why such a serious
  meltdown has occurred in the world’s financial markets and I want to gauge whether
  the US government’s rescue package will work. Dr Gareth Morgan has had a lot to
  say recently about the financial meltdown and, as he is well-qualified to assess
  the situation, I have been reading his views with interest. Maybe it’s just me,
  but I soon found myself getting some pretty contradictory messages.\n\nDr Morgan
  advised that an increasing predilection by the world’s central banks to \"save the
  world\" whenever the going gets tough can **singularly** (my emphasis) be blamed.
  He then opined that “what‘s behind the current crisis is an orgy of debt - an unrestrained
  appetite for lending and borrowing, no matter the risk of the transaction”.\n\nThis
  seems like a bank problem to me and it made me wonder whether there might be a dual
  rather a singular source of blame. But Dr Morgan explained that a message has been
  sent to the effect that, in the event that an institution over-stepped the mark,
  it was odds-on that the Central bank would step in. This points the finger at the
  Central banks with the implication that they have made financial institutions irresponsible
  by their apparent willingness to bail them out. However in the next breath Dr Morgan
  suggested that the Central bank might have done no more than aiding and abetting
  the suicide of the financial sector. This seems to redirect the finger at financial
  institutions.\n\nThe suggestion that financial institutions indulged in an ‘orgy
  of debt’ because they believed the central bank would bail them out does not sit
  well with me. I do not for a moment believe that staff in any financial institution
  anywhere in the world have done shonky deals on the basis that if they go wrong
  that would be ok because the Central bank would bail them out. That point aside,
  financial institutions want to succeed not suffer the ignominy of a collapse or
  a bail out.\n\nThe multitude of finance companies that have failed in NZ after indulging
  in an ‘orgy of debt’ certainly had no expectation of a bailout by our Reserve Bank
  or the Government. On the other hand, management at the ANZ undoubtedly realise
  that ANZ is too significant in NZ for the Government to allow it to fail. Despite
  this there is no suggestion ANZ has indulged in an ‘orgy of debt’.\n\nThere is little
  point in trying to assign blame unless it is part of a process to identify the source
  of the problem so that it can be fixed. To my mind the primary, if not singular,
  source of the problem is the lending institutions themselves, not the Central banks.
  And they have been aided and abetted not by the Central banks as Dr. Morgan suggests,
  but by the derivatives market. \n\nDerivatives are highly risky instruments with
  no underlying asset to support them. They started with securitisation (the selling
  of parcels of loans) and moved on to include credit default swaps (a type of credit
  risk insurance). These instruments were relatively straight forward initially but
  variations on them (derivatives) were developed over time allowing them to be used
  as a tools for financial speculation. At this point things got absurdly complex
  and the rot set in.\n\nTransparency went out the window along with trust. The linkages
  back to the security of the original asset were broken and this created great uncertainty
  about the value of the assets the financial institutions are holding. In some cases
  this value is less than the value of the financial institution’s loans which, in
  the minds of many, is a pretty good definition of insolvency. No one is too sure
  which financial institutions are insolvent (apart from the ones that have already
  fallen over!) and this has made financial institutions wary about dealing with each
  other. Interbank trading is a crucial part of the financial system so it is not
  surprising that this has triggered a catastrophic chain of events.\n\nSo I think
  to fix the problem we have to start with financial institutions and find ways to
  monitor and control the derivatives market. This is what the US Treasury is planning
  to do and they have to be applauded for that. But whether they are going about this
  task in the best way is another question entirely.\n\nOne last thought. Maybe the
  real culprits are not the financial institutions, or the central banks or the derivatives
  market. Maybe we need to blame the borrowers. If they had not borrowed excessively
  in the first place none of this would have happened. Or would it?\n\nWe at [Sharesight](/)
  would be interested in your views. What do you think? What are the implications
  for the Australasian share markets?\n\n<small>*This information is not a recommendation
