  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nDividend reinvestment plans
  or DRIPs (DRPs in Australia and New Zealand) allow investors to reinvest their cash
  dividends to purchase new shares in a company. DRPs allow for direct acquisition
  of shares from the company itself, sometimes at a discount to the market value,
  and involve no brokerage fees. While these benefits might sound like a good reason
  to partake in the scheme, there are some things to keep in mind before deciding
  to partake in a DRP.\n\n### This article will cover:\n\n- [How DRPs work](#how-drps-work)\n-

  How DRPs work\n\nBefore jumping into the advantages and disadvantages of dividend
  reinvestment plans, here’s an example of how they work:\n\n- Let’s say you own 1,000
  shares in company X.\n- You have chosen to participate in its DRP so that 100% of
  your dividends are reinvested.\n- The company announces a dividend of 15 cents per
  share.\n- The shares have a market value of $10.50 each.\n- You would normally receive
  $150 in the form of a cash dividend (1,000 x $0.15).\n- However because you’re enrolled
  in the DRP, you receive 14 shares (14 x $10.50 = $147), which increases your total
  holding to 1,014 shares.\n- Because the remaining $3 isn’t enough to buy a share,
  the amount is carried forward to the next dividend payment.\n\n## Pros of dividend
  reinvestment plans\nTaking the above into consideration, there are a number of advantages
  that DRPs offer investors, including: \n\n### No brokerage fees\nReinvested dividends
  enable the acquisition of new shares/stocks with no brokerage fees. This makes for
  a very cost-effective method for buying new shares over time. Not having to pay
  brokerage fees can make a big difference, especially for small trades, as they are
  one of the main expenses for investors which eat into returns.\n\n### Dollar cost
  averaging \n[Dollar cost averaging](/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/)
  is a strategy where investors buy the same amount of shares on a regular interval,
  building savings and wealth over a long period. DRPs incorporate a similar idea,
  with your money being regularly reinvested back into the same company, and gradually
  growing your holdings. At times, the shares will be purchased when they are overvalued,
  and at other times when they are undervalued. However it should even-out over time.
  As a result, investors will have less tendency to make an emotional buy/sell decision,
  as they have a set strategy in place.\n\n### Purchase discount\nSometimes DRPs offer
  new shares with a discount to the market price. These discounts can range from 1
  - 5% and can be a great incentive to partake in a DRP.\n\n### Capital management
  tool for companies\nDRPs also benefit companies, as they utilise the scheme to retain
  capital, paying dividends in the form of newly issued shares. As a result, the company
  maintains its capital, which can then be reinvested back into the business for future
  growth.\n\n### Simplifies the investment process\nDRPs appeal to “set-and-forget
  investors”, as they can simplify their investing strategy by automatically reinvesting
  their dividends in new shares. This makes it very easy to grow their portfolio without
  needing to spend much time or attention on their investments.\n\n### Saving strategy\nDRPs
  can be considered a form of forced or passive saving as you don't ever personally
  receive any of the dividend money, therefore cannot be tempted to spend it.\n\n###
  Compounding growth\nGrows your portfolio value incrementally, providing the benefit
  of compounding as each time a DRPs is offered, you will receive a larger number
  of shares than the previous time (if dividend payouts are unchanged).\n\n### No
  lower limit\nThere is no lower limit on the number of shares that are required to
  be owned by an investor, meaning all investors are eligible and able to benefit
  from dividend reinvestment plans.\n\n## Cons of dividend reinvestment plans\n\nNow
  that we’ve covered the positive aspects of DRPs, let’s look at the reasons many
  investors avoid DRPs. \n\n### No control over price or time\nInvestors who partake
  in a DRP do not have any control over the time and price that the shares are purchased,
  as they are automatically “purchased” on the dividend payout date. This means that
  you could be buying when the shares are very expensive (although the reverse could
  be true too -- see “dollar cost averaging”, above). Over a long period, this effect
  usually balances out, being no better or worse off. For less sophisticated investors
  who don’t continually monitor and try to predict share prices, this will make little
  difference. However, for more advanced investors, this is considered a significant
  drawback.\n\n### Unbalanced portfolio allocation\nRegistering for an automatic DRP
  can be an attractive way to grow your investments. However, this can lead to your
  portfolio being heavily weighted in certain areas, and unbalancing your target portfolio
  allocation. Therefore, it is essential to monitor your portfolio allocations, rebalancing
  them as necessary.\n\n### Reduces diversification\nFor many investors, dividend
  income is used to initiate new positions in different shares. However, in DRPs,
  dividend payouts are directly reinvested back into the same company, potentially
  preventing the establishment of new holdings and thus leading to a lack of portfolio
  diversification over time.\n\n### Not suitable for short-term investors\nDRPs are
  not suitable for short term investors as purchasing the shares on the market is
  much faster compared to obtaining shares through a DRP. This is especially true
  for stocks that pay dividends quarterly or bi-annually, rather than monthly. Therefore,
  it is often much better for shorter-term investors to take the cash dividend and
  purchase shares separately.\n\n### No income stream\nAs DRPs require sacrificing
  cash in exchange for new shares in the company, it removes the stream of income
  that is associated with dividend payments. For a retiree or someone who depends
  on dividends to support their living expenses, this strategy is not ideal.\n\n###
  Dilution of ownership\nDRPs dilute the ownership for an investor in a company as
  new shares are issued, meaning to maintain the same level ownership, more shares
  need to be purchased. A maximum level of participation may be introduced to reduce
  this dilutive effect, discouraging institutional shareholders from participating.\n\n###
  Tedious record keeping\nDRPs require both the share purchase price and dividend
  payment amount to be recorded each time for every dividend payment. This can be
  very painful to keep track of, especially with a large portfolio. However this portfolio
  admin problem can be easily solved by using a dedicated portfolio tracker such as
  [Sharesight](/). For more info, see: *[How to track a dividend reinvestment plan](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)*.\n\n![DRP

  plans\n\n### Australia\n[As per the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/Dividend-reinvestment-plans/),
  for capital gain purposes, DRPs are treated as if you had received the dividend
  and then used it to purchase additional shares. Franking credits are dealt with
  in exactly the same manner. If you received a discount, it is not considered taxable
  income at the time of purchase, rather it is included in the CGT at the time of
  sale.\n\nWhen selling shares that have been issued through a DRP, the cost base
  for the CGT is determined by the market price of the shares at the time of purchase.
  This is the true price paid for the shares, including any discounts to the share
  price, which your CGT will be based on.\n\n### Canada\nIf a Canadian investor chooses
  to take part in a DRIP, their ordinary taxable dividend is subject to the gross-up
  (for Canadian companies) and dividend tax credit provisions that is faced by all
  dividends. The new shares that have been acquired through a stock dividend are deemed
  to have been acquired at a cost equal to the stock dividend amount. When selling
  their investment, the CGT is applied where the difference between the adjusted cost
  base (ACB) and the net proceeds received is considered a capital gain or loss. Investors
  partaking in a DRIP within a tax-free RSP or TFSA account don’t have to worry about
  this, but those investing in taxable accounts may want to read this article on the
  *[tax treatment of Canadian dividend paying stocks](https://www.myownadvisor.ca/tax-treatment-canadian-dividend-paying-stocks/)*.\n\n###
  U.S.\n[As per the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/capital-gains-losses-and-sale-of-home/stocks-options-splits-traders/stocks-options-splits-traders-2),
  if you choose to reinvest your dividends in a DRIP, the IRS treats this as two different
  events. First, the dividend is treated as taxable income, with no difference from
  a regular dividend payout. Second is the share purchase and future sale where the
  capital gains will be later taxed.\n\nSome U.S. companies also allow for investors
  to purchase additional shares of a stock at below market price, in this case, the
  cash reinvested, and the fair market value of the stock are taxed as ordinary dividend
  income.\n\n## Track the impact of dividends on your investment performance\n\nWith
