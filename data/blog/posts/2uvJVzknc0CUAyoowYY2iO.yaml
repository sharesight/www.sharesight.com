:title: Q&A with Sharesight co-founder and CTO Scott Ryburn
:url_slug: qa-with-sharesight-co-founder-and-cto-scott-ryburn-on-10-years-of-sharesight
:content: "###### This post is part of Sharesight’s 10 year anniversary series. Scroll
  down to the Further Reading section for every post in the series or read [Sharesight’s
  10 year fintech journey](/blog/sharesights-10-year-fintech-journey/) post to get
  started.\n\nWith [Sharesight](/) being founded 10 year ago this month, I sat down
  with Sharesight co-founder and CTO Scott Ryburn to learn about the history of Sharesight
  and Scott’s fintech startup journey over the last decade.\n\n![featured scott-ryburn-sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6pZw4ExOg0MQACICo6kA4A/02479f4b4b2d3470a34630c908ce1243/featured_scott-ryburn-sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n<small><i>Scott
  Ryburn, Sharesight co-founder & CEO</i></small>\n\n### You started Sharesight with
  your father, after years of tinkering with complex spreadsheets to help him manage
  his share portfolio. How did you decide to build a SaaS product to do this instead?\n\nWe
  started looking for a better solution to the [portfolio tracking spreadsheets](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  we were using to track our portfolio. However despite a lot of searching we couldn't
  really find anything better.\n\nThere seemed to be a real gap between the very basic
  reporting tools that online brokers were offering, and desktop share portfolio software
  that seemed really antiquated, expensive and overly complex. Plus a lot of the more
  sophisticated products that we found were focused on compliance and lacked decent
  performance reporting.\n\nI think we discussed the idea of developing our own product
  on-and-off for a few years (although in a very non-serious way initially) before
  we ultimately convinced ourselves to give it a shot. From the beginning Sharesight
  was conceived as an online product. Although software-as-a-service (SaaS) was perhaps
  a bit of a new trend in those days, it made a lot of sense for something like Sharesight.\n\n![Sharesight

  Abletech (who are also early Sharesight investors). How did that relationship come
  about and how has the Sharesight developer team grown since then?\n\nWith no programming
  experience and a limited budget, our first challenge was to find software developers.
  We contracted a designer to create mockups to illustrate our vision and then basically
  pitched our idea to as many developers as we could find. We received estimates that
  ranged anywhere from $50k to $500k and quickly realised that outsourcing the development
  was going to be a risky proposition!\n\nWe met the [Abletech](https://abletech.nz)
  guys ([Nigel Ramsay](https://twitter.com/nigelramsay/) and [Marcus Baguley](https://twitter.com/marcusbaguley))
  through a contact of our designer. As share investors themselves, they understood
  the problems we were trying to solve and were keen to get involved on an equity
  basis. This was the perfect solution for us and we formed the company soon after.
  Today we have 8 full-time staff on the Sharesight development team in Wellington.\n\n![Sharesight

  in 2009 using the very first version of the Xero API. What drove the decision to
  integrate with Xero and how has the Xero API integration changed over the years?\n\nOne
  of our early features was [the ability to share your portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/),
  so as a result of this many accountants were introduced to Sharesight through their
  clients. Xero started around the same time as Sharesight and they were doing a great
  job of explaining the benefits of online software. So demand for an API connection
  initially came from accountants who were enthusiastic Xero users with first-hand
  experience of the benefits of the cloud. It helped that the Xero office was just
  down the road from us here in Wellington and we knew some of their key people even
  from pre-Xero days.\n\nOver the years we have continued to develop [Sharesight’s
  Xero integration](/xero/) to support multi-currency, DRPs/journal entries, background
  sync, cash accounts, etc. We also became the first Xero Add-on partner to resell
  the [Xero Cashbook](/blog/xero-cashbooks-now-available-via-sharesight/) product
  directly to our subscribers. Sharesight and Xero work hand-in-hand and complement
  each other perfectly.\n\n![Sharesight team at Xerocon](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5K9T7y6zq8ymy20iiE8myW/20f6f8c0ed0d420dd1d852d00dcdb8f9/sharesight-team-xerocon.png?w=950)\n<small><i>Scott
  and other members of the Sharesight team, accepting the award for <a href=\"/blog/sharesight-wins-xero-add-partner-year/\">Xero
  Add-On Partner of the Year 2014</a>.</i></small>\n\n### Sharesight released its
  first API in 2010. How did you go about building it?\n\nThe initial requirements
  for the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) came from Direct
  Broking, who were looking to integrate with us to allow their customers to automatically
  sync trading information to Sharesight. We also leveraged the knowledge we gained
  from [connecting Sharesight to Xero](https://help.sharesight.com/xero_settings/)
  using the Xero API. Ultimately we developed a RESTful API using the OAuth authentication
  protocol which is still the common template for most modern web based APIs. \n\n[Direct
  Broking was our first broker API partner](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-and-direct-broking/)
  (what we refer to as [Sharesight Connect](https://help.sharesight.com/sharesight_connect/)),
  and we now have similar integrations with [CMC Markets Stockbrocking](/blog/sharesight-teams-up-with-cmc-markets-stockbroking/),
  [Bendigo Invest Direct](/blog/sharesight-bendigo-bank/), [Bank of Queensland](/blog/sharesight-bank-of-queensland/),
  and [eBroking/eSuperfund](/blog/announcing-new-sharesight-strategic-partner-esuperfund-ebroking/).\n\n###
  Sharesight’s performance calculations are run in real-time. How have you managed
  scaling over the years?\n\nSharesight’s [real-time performance calculations](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/)
  are quite CPU and memory intensive in comparison to most web apps and also involve
  a lot of database queries behind the scenes. Scalability has involved a combination
  of optimisations to the code, increased server capacity, and taking advantage of
  new technology. We moved our entire server infrastructure to AWS (Amazon Web Services)
  a couple of years ago which has been great and allowed us to take advantage of a
  number of their leading-edge technologies. For example we recently moved Sharesight
  to the Amazon Aurora database service, which boasts 5X the throughput of our previous
  standard MySQL database.\n\n### Sharesight customers sometimes ask us where their
  data is held and how secure is it. How do you protect customer data and how has
  it changed over time?\n\nSharesight customers trust us to keep their personal financial
  records secure and it’s a responsibility that we take very seriously. Security is
  top of mind with every new feature or code change and we pay close attention to
  ensure that our servers are up to date with the latest security updates. We’re always
  on the lookout for ways to enhance security. For example, we recently introduced
  database encryption and 2FA (two-factor authentication) via [Google sign-in](/blog/login-to-sharesight-with-google/).
  A full overview of Sharesight’s security practices is [available here](https://help.sharesight.com/how-sharesight-protects-your-data/).\n\n###
  What do you believe has been the most important change to the Sharesight user interface
  in the last 10 years?\n\nWe've generally developed the interface iteratively over
  time, favouring small incremental changes. Certainly the biggest change was switching
  to the tab-based navigation that's currently in place, which also included an updated
  colour theme. We followed this up by introducing overlays for editing trades and
  dividends which also made a big difference to the speed and ease of navigation.
  More recently we've turned our efforts to improving the [Sharesight Mobile App](https://help.sharesight.com/sharesight-mobile-app/)
  and overall web experience.\n\n### The Sharesight Mobile App was released in 2016.
  How did you build the app to support multiple mobile platforms?\n\nWe built our
  mobile app as a web app initially using the Ember.js javascript framework and then
  used the Apache Cordova framework to wrap this into a mobile app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/sharesight-reader/id1147841214?mt=8)
  and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sharesight.reader&hl=en).
  The advantage of this approach was that our developers could use familiar technology
  to create the mobile app and we don't have to maintain a separate codebase for each
  platform.\n\n![Scott Ryburn - Sharesight co-founder & CTO](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3h6yxWmrRYoUcKAo8Em0Iq/7b3a5c1b633b30b448ac25be00396b94/scott-ryburn_sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n<small><i>Scott
  Ryburn, Sharesight co-founder & CEO</i></small>\n\n### Sharesight tracks tens of
  thousands of portfolios all over the world. Do you have a particular investment
  philosophy?\nFor me it's pretty simple, I invest in companies that I like, understand,
  and operate in an industry with long-term potential. Suffice to say my largest investment
  is in Sharesight!\n\n### What is it about New Zealand that makes for such a hotbed
  for technology?\nI think New Zealanders really cherish innovation and as a nation
  we tend to be early adopters of technology. There's also some good government support
  available for startups which really helps ([Sharesight received early stage seed
  capital from the NZ Venture Investment Fund](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1003/S00013/sharesight-plans-rapid-expansion-in-australia.htm)).
  Additionally the NZ lifestyle and visa requirements that are not overly restrictive
  allow us to attract overseas talent that is crucial to the continued growth of the
  tech sector. Here in Wellington, companies like Trade Me and Xero have shown us
  what's possible and inspired many young startups and entrepreneurs.\n\n### What's
  next for Sharesight in terms of product/tech?\nFollow our [community forum](https://community.sharesight.com)
  and [subscribe to the Sharesight blog](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/r/5C6AB96D05E5929A)
  and be the first to know!\n\n### What do you wish you knew then that you know now?
  What lesson would you share with an up-and-coming fintech founder/CTO?\nI think
  the most important thing is to find the people with the skills and experience that
  you lack and find a way to get them on board as early as you can. There's no shortage
  of advice on offer if you seek it out, but always remember that what worked for
  someone else may not work for you. At the end of the day, you have to trust your
  instincts.\n\n### Thanks for your time Scott. I look forward to getting an update
  from you after the next 10 years of Sharesight!\n\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- [These
