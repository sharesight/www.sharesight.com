  What is the BATS Markets BZX exchange?\n\nThe Better Alternative Trading System
  (BATS) was established in 2005 to provide an alternative exchange to trade US equities,
  options and foreign exchange. The BZX exchange became a registered exchange in 2008,
  growing to be the largest competitor to the NYSE in equities and the largest US
  ETF exchange before being acquired by CBOE Holdings (CBOE) in 2017. \n\nSharesight
  now tracks the more than 300 stocks, ETFs and ETPs listed solely on the BZX, this
  gives Sharesight virtually complete coverage of all US stocks and exchanges, including:\n\n*
