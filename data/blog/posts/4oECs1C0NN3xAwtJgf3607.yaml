:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only

  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIn this Sharesight20
  yearly trading snapshot we look at the 20 most traded stocks by Sharesight users
  on the NASDAQ in 2019 and examine how they performed during the year.\n\nLet’s dive
  into 2019’s top 20 trades.\n\n## Sharesight20 top 20 NASDAQ trades in 2019\n\n![Top
  20 NASDAQ](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7ray7Dv8WHF41qMRHXUwyk/1e3469c12a0e9d37d8bca8c4a17e7866/Top_20__NASDAQ.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
  Click image to zoom</small>\n\nInvestors using Sharesight bought and sold Apple
  (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock significantly more often than any other stock listed on the
  NASDAQ in 2019. Among the top 5, trades roughly correlate with company market cap
  with the exception with the exception of Tesla (22nd by market cap) which jumped
  ahead of Facebook (4th by market cap) with investors buying into Elon Musk’s vision
  for the electric car maker. \n\nNow let’s look at the performance of these stocks
  in 2019.\n\n## Top 20 NASDAQ trades in 2019 - investment performance\n\nTo calculate
  the performance of these stocks during 2019 we built a Sharesight portfolio domiciled
  in the same country as the exchange (to remove the impact of currency fluctuations)
  that contained these 20 stocks and invested an equally weighted (5% of the total
  portfolio) amount in each stock on January 1st 2019 (or the first listed date for
  stocks that listed after that date).\n\nWe then ran [Sharesight’s Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  to calculate the portfolio’s 2019 performance. Here’s the results, ordered by Total
  Return.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Code</th>\n    <th>Name</th>\n    <th>Capital

  \ </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n \n\nComputer CPU and graphics chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ: AMD)
  was the standout performer with returns of 148.43% in 2019. Among the top 20 trades,
  7 of the companies paid (relatively modest) dividends in 2019, with many companies
  opting to use capital to reinvest in growth. \n\nOverall an equally weighted portfolio
  of these 20 stocks would have performed strongly with a 50.15% return during 2019.\n\n
