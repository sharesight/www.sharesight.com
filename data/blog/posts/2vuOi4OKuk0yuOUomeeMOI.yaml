:content: "With Sharesight, it’s easy to save time and money at EOFY and tax time.
  One of the best ways to do this is by [sharing portfolio access](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/)
  with your accountant, which allows them to see your trading activity, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/),
  capital gains and more – all in one place. To learn more about Sharesight’s portfolio
  sharing feature and how you can use this to your advantage at tax time, keep reading.
  \n\n![Share your portfolio with your accountant](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3ivBBoPsoEtoB7AY67PFEA/5de2dbacf53d226880bbf777c1c7659e/Share_your_portfolio_with_your_accountant.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Why you should share your Sharesight portfolio with your accountant\n\n[Sharing
  your Sharesight portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/) with
  your accountant is a simple way to save time (and hefty fees) at tax time. Not only
  does Sharesight eliminate the tedious portfolio admin associated with tracking your
  investments in a spreadsheet, but it also makes life much easier for your accountant
  by doing all the historical work for them. This means they can focus on getting
  you the best possible tax outcomes, while reducing back-and-forth communication
  over records and statements. \n\n## Tips to prepare your Sharesight portfolio for
  your accountant\n\nBy using Sharesight to track your investments, data such as your
  [dividends and distributions](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/), trading
  activity, capital gains and foreign currency impacts are automatically recorded
  – significantly reducing the time your accountant needs to spend collecting and
  verifying your records. To save as much time and money at tax time as possible,
  however, here are a few tips to ensure your portfolio is completely up-to-date and
  ready for your accountant: \n\n1. Verify and [confirm your unconfirmed transactions](https://help.sharesight.com/confirming-multiple-unconfirmed-transactions/)\n\n2.
  Ensure your trades are [recorded correctly](https://help.sharesight.com/edit_trade/)\n\n3.
  Check whether you need to [manually record any corporate actions](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/)
  that weren’t handled automatically\n\n4. Verify that the [return of your portfolio
  is correct](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/interpreting-portfolio-performance/).\n\n![unconfirmed
  transaction dividend](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/vMdZqZETpQkg1UGw3rQrT/48bab03e9a891fc0d8be1fb9441ec4ff/unconfirmed_transaction_dividend.PNG)\n\n<small>
  Dividends and adjustments are automatically generated by Sharesight, however you
  will be prompted to verify and confirm the details of these transactions to ensure
  the accuracy of your portfolio. </small>\n\n## How to share portfolio access with
  your accountant\n\nTo share portfolio access with your accountant, all you need
  to do is access the Settings tab and click Portfolio Sharing. From here, simply
  enter your accountant’s name and email address to send them a [secure, private login](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/)
  which they can use to access your portfolio. \n\nYour accountant will have real-time
  access to your portfolio, with the ability to see your holdings, dividends, corporate
  actions and any trades you make. \n\n![portfolio sharing settings](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/uk7VVeQF4AdbsMogbsdwT/bb804b85b7d06aacdf307c1b0aae9dd0/portfolio_sharing_settings.PNG)\n\nAccess
  to a portfolio can be withdrawn or modified to your liking. For example, as seen
  in the screenshot above, you can choose whether your accountant has \"read only\"
  access, or whether they can make edits to your portfolio. And if you have more than
  one portfolio, you can choose which portfolios your accountant has access to based
  on your needs. \n\nFor more information on how to share your portfolio, here is
  an instructional video: \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nSd-PmryGM\"

  tax reports are a quick and easy way to break down a portfolio’s capital gains,

  any financial statements that require mark-to-market accounting, the [Historical
  Cost Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/prepare-your-annual-accounts-with-sharesights-historical-cost-report/)
