:title: How and why I track my SelfWealth trades with Sharesight
:content: "About a year ago I started using [SelfWealth](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-selfwealth-trades-into-sharesight/)
  as my primary online broker after using a number of other brokers in the past. Because
  details of my trades are scattered across multiple brokers, this makes Sharesight
  essential for tracking my performance and tax.\n\nWith Sharesight I can keep track
  of my investments from all my brokers, dividend earnings, dividend reinvestment
  plans (DRPs), and easily see the performance across all my listed and unlisted investments.
  Here’s how I do this.\n\n![Why track Selfwealth Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7puKKVEIZOlvEaPY5cn2In/948418f22ede8ad4424b3c2b6c8434f6/Why_track_Selfwealth_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How I track my SelfWealth trades with Sharesight\n\nGetting the [trades I make with
  SelfWealth into my Sharesight portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-selfwealth-trades-into-sharesight/)
  is a simple process which involves SelfWealth forwarding a copy of my trade confirmation
  emails to my Sharesight portfolio email address. It’s all done behind the scenes,
  and I only had to set this up once for all my future trades to flow into Sharesight.\n\nIn
  case you are like me and have tried out several different brokers in your investing
  journey, Sharesight allows you to keep your portfolio up-to-date automatically by
  supporting [trade confirmation emails for hundreds of brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  from around the world. This is how I have synced the trades I made with my previous
  brokers with my Sharesight portfolio.\n\nIt is extremely satisfying to place a trade
  and then see it appear in my Sharesight portfolio automatically, it saves me so
  much time on portfolio admin. It also gives me peace of mind knowing that it’s automatically
  taken care of, and I have one less thing to worry about.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6RrsmeohpM\"

  of the investments I make via SelfWealth with Sharesight\n\nI’m really happy to
  trade with SelfWealth and don’t plan on switching to a different broker. They charge
  very reasonable brokerage fees for a [CHESS sponsored broker](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-chess/),
  and I find their platform straightforward and modern. To track my performance on
  the other hand, I insist on using Sharesight.\n\nWhy don’t I just track my performance
  on SelfWealth you might ask? As a self-directed investor, I’ll give you a few examples
  of important data that I need incorporated into my return figures that most brokers
  don't give you.\n\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n    \t<td bgcolor=\"#fae5cc\" colspan=\"3\"><span

  to Sharesight every day the markets are open, and most of the time this includes
  a quick glance at the [Performance Index Graph](https://help.sharesight.com/interpreting-the-return-index-graph/)
  and my return figures on the [Portfolio Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xa8phjSVhM)
  page. I do this for my own portfolios, and also [portfolios that have been shared
  with me](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/) by family members.\n\nOnce
  in a while, when I am interested in a specific period of time, I will visit the
  old faithful [Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/).\n\nWhen
  I receive a dividend, I log in to Sharesight to [confirm the details](https://help.sharesight.com/au/confirming-individual-unconfirmed-transactions/)
  and upload relevant documents which I will go into more detail in the last section.\n\nAt
  tax time I am able to use the [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/)
  and [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/taxable_income/) to help
  me with filing my Australian tax return.\n\n## Bye bye paperwork\n\nDuring my short
  investing journey, I’ve used 4 online brokers, 3 ETF providers, and 2 share registries.
  The amount of paperwork I receive in the mail is overwhelming, and until recently
  I would keep this ever growing pile of papers in a drawer.\n\nI finally decided
  to stop this madness. I began snapping a photo of these papers using my mobile phone,
  [uploading them to Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-do-i-attach-a-file-in-sharesight/),
  and then physically recycling them.\n\nIn addition to my paperwork, I do the same
  with my email attachments. This makes life so much easier to have everything in
  one place. No need to sort through my piles of papers, and no need to log into my
  share registries or brokers to locate missing documents.\n\n## Sign up to track
