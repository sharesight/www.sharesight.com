:title: Improved Canadian portfolio benchmarking
:content: "Canadian investors, if you haven’t used [Sharesight’s benchmarking feature](/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/),
  now’s the time to try it, as we’ve made it even better with the addition of three
  Canadian index-tracking ETFs to our common benchmark selector.\n\n## Why benchmark
  your portfolio against ETFs?\n\nBenchmarking against the “index” or the “[S&P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_Dow_Jones_Indices)”
  is purely theoretical. However [ETFs make a great benchmark](/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)
  because they’re a legitimate investment option and they take into account all the
  inner workings of a real portfolio, including fees and any dividends that may apply.\n\n![Canadian
  ETF benchmarks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3qszrTzbcAuGAwmsskwMe8/a7cf5be6c1b494583808fb9cb5e002dc/Canadian_ETF_benchmarks.png?w=950)\n\nSharesight’s
  benchmarking feature allows investors to select any ETF that is tracked by Sharesight
  as a benchmark, but to make things easier, we’ve added three ETFs to the dropdown
  selector that will be useful for Canadian investors in particular.\n\n## Common
  Canadian benchmarks\n\n[Investors with Canadian portfolios](/ca/) will now see the
  following three common benchmarks when using Sharesight’s Benchmarking feature:\n\n![Canadian
  common stock benchmarks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/dodXJ65nMceiMscOaaksI/436634f1afa0e375545e79ea3d099ffd/Canadian_common_stock_benchmarks.png?w=950)\n\n###
  iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF (TSE: XIU)\n\n[iShare S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/products/239832/ishares-sptsx-60-index-etf?switchLocale=y&siteEntryPassthrough=true)
  units are made up of stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange that represent the S&P/TSX
  60 Index. It focuses on the 60 largest, most heavily-traded stocks on the exchange.\n\n###
  Vanguard FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF (TSE: VDY)\n\nThe [Vanguard
  FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF](https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/advisors/adv/en/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=9560/assetCode=equity/?overview)
  seeks to replicate, net of expenses, the FTSE Canada High Dividend Yield Index.
  It invests primarily in common stocks of Canadian companies that pay dividends.\n\n###
  Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF (TSE: VCN)\n\nThe [Vanguard FTSE Canada All
  Cap Index ETF](https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/indv/en/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=9561/assetCode=equity/?overview)
  currently seeks to replicate, net of expenses, the FTSE Canada All Cap Index, which
  is an equity index that measures the investment return of small to large market
  capitalisation stocks in the Canadian market. \n\nIn addition to these three Canadian
  benchmarks, investors will continue to see the iShares Europe ETF (NYSE: IEV), SPDR
  S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) and Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (NYSE VEU) common benchmarks.
  \n\nThey may also use the search feature to select [any ETF tracked by Sharesight
  as a benchmark](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/) if preferred.\n\n![ETF

  Canadian benchmarks in Sharesight\n\nThese common Canadian benchmarks are available
  on portfolios with a Canadian tax residency on Sharesight [Investor, Expert](/pricing/),
  and [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) plans. [Upgrade today](/pricing/) to access Sharesight’s
  benchmarking feature.\n\nMake sure to read [Sharesight’s step-by-step guide to benchmarking](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/)
  as well as our Help section on [how to interpret the return index graph](https://help.sharesight.com/interpreting-the-return-index-graph/)
  when using this feature.\n\nPlease give us feedback in the [Sharesight community
  forum](http://community.sharesight.com/).\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- [Sharesight
