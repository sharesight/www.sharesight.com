:title: Rough week on the sharemarket?
:url_slug: rough-week
:content: "It's been a bit of a [rough week](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10487509)
  on the share market. Both in New Zealand and Australia. Currently we're up to 12
  straight days of losses.\n\nBut, is it really all doom and gloom? I've been keeping
  a close eye on my portfolio using [Sharesight](/). Sure, there's some red in there,
  but it's not that bad. The reason I'm not terribly depressed is because I get the
  full picture on my portfolio. That's capital gains, dividend payouts and also currency
  movements.\n\nFor many of my shares, I'm actually still ahead compared to this time
  last year. Take for example, my investment in [Colonial Motor Company](https://www.nzx.com/companies/CMO)
  (CMO.NZ). \n\n![Rough week on the sharemarket](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/16dljljD7QQUW0wO28Ikmc/c54ec60b8fe6c91d19fc75d6d896afcc/CMO.png?w=950)\n\nIncluding
  those 12 straight days of losses, I'm actually ahead by 8.5% Sure, if I only look
  at the capital gains or losses - it's a sad story. But, to get an accurate picture
  you have to look at all of the individual components that contribute to your total
  performance.\n\nSo I suggest if you're feeling a little down about your investments,
  take a closer look at all the components - Capital Gains, Dividends and Currency
  movements. I think you'll find it's not as bad as your initially thought!\n\nIf
