:title: 'Investing solutions for the global investor: Event wrap-up'
:content: "We’ve all heard how [investment diversification](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/investment-diversification-why-does-it-matter/)
  is key to being a successful investor during volatile times. But how do investors
  actually go about increasing their exposure to international markets to achieve
  geographic diversification?\n\nAnswers to this and more were revealed during an
  event hosted by [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/) in conjunction with [Saxo
  Markets](https://www.home.saxo/en-au/products/stocks?cmpid=AF_22935801;250913561;0&dclid=CNah_r71x-QCFSkNtwAdoxkBlA)
  last night in Sydney, where [Sharesight’s new Saxo Markets integration](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-saxo-markets/)
  was also revealed.\n\nAt the event, Sharesight CEO Doug Morris shared insights on
  the exposure of Sharesight’s Australian users to international markets, and the
  role Sharesight’s performance and tax reporting plays as part of the complete suite
  of tools needed by global investors.\n\n\nSaxo Markets’ CEO Adam Smith spoke to
  the demand from clients for integrations with fintechs like Sharesight, and Saxo
  Markets’ Market Strategist Eleanor Creagh explored the global macroeconomic themes
  shaping markets in 2019.\n\n![Investing solutions for the global investor event

  The importance of geographic diversification for investors\n\nDoug’s presentation
  centred on the need for investors to invest globally and contrasted the relatively
  high rates of international exposure among Australian Sharesight users to the average
  figures across all investors in Australia.\n\n### How global are the investments
  of Sharesight users?\n\nAustralian Sharesight users (on paid plans):\n\n    * Median
  annual return 12%\n\n    * 74% Australian markets\n\n    * 10% US markets\n\n![image

  Saxo Markets - Overview\n\n![Adam Smith Saxo Markets CEO](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2hu5g7y6HVYLFietuUpxUZ/977202a2391a1432a11e376e6510a427/Adam_Smith_Saxo_Markets_CEO.jpg?w=950)\n\nAdam
  spoke about Saxo Markets, their history and global presence, relating the problem
  that many self-directed investors have with the tax side of the equation, and his
  excitement to be able to offer a tool like Sharesight to help Saxo Markets’ clients
  solve that problem.\n\n**Saxo Markets**\n\n* First digital access platform\n\n*
  Covers the full spectrum of clients (DIY/HNW/SMSF/traders/asset managers, etc)\n\n*
  35,000 tradable products\n\n* Ability to trade *every* asset class (if they don’t
  offer a particular investment, just ask)\n\n* Clients from over 170 countries\n\n*
  16 offices globally (headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark)\n\n* SCMA (Saxo Capital
  Markets Australia) licenced by ASIC\n\n## An understanding of the macroeconomic
  outlook for global investors\n\n![Eleanor Creagh Saxo Markets Strategist](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7uoXACcUxg9NCUxfej4mQO/eee824c1a30a654ff6bbee37730af448/Eleanor_Creagh_Saxo_Markets_Strategist.jpg?w=950)\n\nEleanor
  provided background on how Saxo Markets’ Strategy department operates. With teams
  based in each regional location, their highly nimble  research house provides Saxo
  Markets’ clients with both local and global research and analysis.\n\n### 2018 macroeconomic
  themes\n\n2018 was a difficult year for investors, as most asset classes had low
  to negative returns by the year end -- due to a range of factors:\n\n* Rising cost
  of money\n\n* Fed tightening cycle\n\n* Shrinking quantity of money\n\n* Shrinking
  US $ liquidity\n\n* Deglobalisation shock / trade wars\n\n* Geopolitical coordination
  tapering off\n\n* Rising uncertainty\n\n### 2019 macroeconomic themes \n\n**False
  stabilisation in markets**\n\n* December 2018 sell-off shook investors\n\n* Federal
  Reserve’s sudden u-turn in the direction of rates \n\n* PMI peaked in Jan 2018 --
  which usually has a lagged impact on consumers \n\n* If historical PMI relationship
  holds up, consumer spending and sentiment to fall\n\n* Cyclical downturn exacerbated
  by trade war tensions\n\n* US$ rising -- tightens financial conditions globally\n\n**Late
  in the cycle**\n\n* Stay invested but manage late cycle risks\n\n* Volatility on
  the rise\n\n* Uncertainty everywhere\n\n* [Diversification will serve you well](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/is-it-time-to-consider-a-defensive-investment-strategy/)\n\n*
  Ageing consumer/digitisation thematics\n\n* Tail risk event chance is rising\n\n*
  Markets appear to be front running -- stimulus expected to come later this year
  from central banks\n\n* The 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic
  of China is in October \n\n* Therefore trade escalation risk between US/China likely
  to be low before then\n\n**The impact of rates**\n\n* Expecting more than a mid-cycle
  adjustment\n\n* Central banks to ease rates \n\n* Fed to cut in September... possibly
  also in October and December\n\n* Passive investing is no longer in vogue\n\n* Focus
  on capital preservation -- low beta minimum volume\n\n* Gold long term might be
  a buying opportunity vs negative yield debt as a hedge against central bank quantitative
  easing\n\n* Fixed income an option in an environment where rates are moving down\n\n*
  US yields heading lower, US$ strength preventing reflation trade globally\n\n##
  Sharesight’s new Saxo Markets Integration\n\nConcluding the event, Doug returned
  to the stage to unveil [Sharesight’s new Saxo Markets Integration](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-saxo-markets/)
  which allows Saxo Markets clients in Australia to easily sync their trading history
  to Sharesight simply by connecting their trading account through the integration.\n\nDemonstrating
  how easy it is, Doug walked the audience through the process to import trades from
  a Saxo Markets account to a Sharesight portfolio, with the process taking less than
  5 minutes before the trades were synced and he was able to run Sharesight’s CGT
  and taxable income reports on the portfolio.\n\n![Doug Morris Sharesight Saxo Markets
