:title: How to handle the Afterpay and Touchcorp merger
:url_slug: how-to-handle-the-afterpay-afy-and-touchcorp-tch-merger
:content: "In February 2017, ASX-listed payments fintech [Afterpay](https://www.afterpay.com)
  (AFY) announced a proposed merger with the payments firm, [Touchcorp](https://afterpaytouch.com)
  (TCH). Both firms had enjoyed a close and productive relationship, with Touchcorp
  developing the technology behind Afterpay’s highly successful ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’
  offering. The merger was described as a ‘natural evolution’ of the existing relationship
  between the two companies, allowing the new business, Afterpay Touch Group, to take
  advantage of revenue opportunities, through a more integrated combination of Afterpay’s
  growing retail network and Touchcorp’s strong technology offering.\n\nAs part of
  the merger, eligible Afterpay shareholders received 1 share in the Afterpay Touch
  Group, for every 1 Afterpay share they held. For Touchcorp shareholders, they received
  0.64 Afterpay Touch Group shares for every 1 Touchcorp share they held.\n\n## How
  to handle the Afterpay-Touchcorp merger in Sharesight\n\nIf you held either Afterpay
  (AFY.ASX) or Touchcorp (TCH.ASX) shares, and have now received shares in the new
  Afterpay Touch Group (APT.ASX), Sharesight makes it easy to handle corporate actions,
  track subsequent performance and account for any potential capital gain or loss.
  \n\nFrom all accounts, this merger is eligible for [rollover relief](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/takeovers-and-mergers,-scrip-for-scrip-rollover/),
  although specifics are subject to the release of an official ATO class ruling. We
  will update this post accordingly, if any changes are required!\n\n### If you held
  Afterpay (AFY.ASX) shares:\n\n1. [Sign up for a FREE Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  and add your Afterpay holding.\n2. From the ‘Holdings’ tab, use the search bar to
  locate your Afterpay holding. You can also find this on the ‘’Overview’ page.\n3.
  Once on the ‘Holdings’ page for your Afterpay holding, click on the ‘Enter a New
  Trade or Adjustment’ button. From the transaction type drop-down list, choose ‘Sell’.
  The date we are using is the ‘Implementation Date’, 6th July 2017 (06/07/2017).
  \n4. Enter your full Afterpay quantity, e.g. 10,000. If rollover relief is chosen,
  the ‘Price’ should reflect your existing Afterpay cost-base, e.g . To find your
  cost-base per share, look for the ‘Holding Information’ tab on the right-hand side
  of the ‘Holdings’ page per the below screenshot. If you have purchased Afterpay
  in more than one parcel and/or have sold some shares, it is best to obtain your
  cost base information from the Historical Cost Report. Look for the ‘Closing Balance’
  and divide that figure by the ‘Closing Quantity’.![Holdings Page Sell and Cost-Base](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/RmqQePqW0SoIcaoEuIKgi/0dbc69a6a48b497f5e40f68475e9c06e/Holdings_Page_Sell_and_Cost-Base.png?w=950)Entering
  the ‘Sell’ at your original cost price will ensure that no capital gain is recorded
  against your original Afterpay holding. ***Note: Write down the ‘Total’ figure,
  as this will be used when adding the new Afterpay Touch Group holding!***\n5. Once
  you’ve done this, from the top of the page, click the ‘Add or Import Holdings’ button.
  You’ll be taken to a new page, from which you’ll be able to enter the details of
  your new Afterpay Touch Group holding. To start, we suggest using an ‘Opening Balance’
  transaction. This allows you to enter a cost-base for tax purposes, as well as a
  market value for the Implementation Date, allowing you to correctly track performance
  for your holding in the new company.\n6. For the ‘Opening Balance’ date, use the
  ‘Implementation Date’, 06/07/2017. The ‘Cost Base’ should be the ‘Total’ you have
  noted from Step 3, and the Quantity the same as your original Afterpay holding.
  Just below the ‘Cost Base’ and ‘Quantity’ fields, you’ll see details regarding ‘Market
  Value’. Click the ‘Edit’ button - in the new ‘Market Price’ field, you can use the
  price Sharesight provides, $3.15, or a market price specified by Afterpay. We’ve
  used the closing price for Afterpay Touch Group on 06/07/2017, $3.15. Once you’ve
  filled in these details, click ‘Save This Holding’:![Opening Balance Afterpay](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/26hfxkJoqkOk6gEYEeuO02/d78a10819d2d959490ce0d64f52cdad9/Opening_Balance_Afterpay.png?w=950)\n\n###
  If you held Touchcorp (TCH.ASX) shares:\n\n1. [Sign up for a FREE Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  and add your Touchcorp holding.\n2. Repeat the same steps, 1 - 4, as seen in the
  Afterpay holders section above, for your Touchcorp shares instead. Remember to make
  a note of the ‘Total’ figure when entering the ‘Sell’ transaction for Touchcorp.
  This will become your cost base.![Sell Touchcorp](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3GuzEppWSkEMcsWoKqcEAO/17ee9a3383baca83b9393434bca8b43b/Sell_Touchcorp.png?w=950)\n3.
  Once you’ve clicked on the ‘Add or Import Holdings’ button, and have selected the
  ‘Opening Balance’ transaction type, enter the ‘Total’ that you’ve noted, in the
  cost base field. When entering the ‘Quantity’, remember that Touchcorp shareholders
  received 0.64 Afterpay Touch Group shares for every 1 Touchcorp share. For example,
  if you held 10,000 Touchcorp shares, you would have received 6,400 Touchcorp shares.
  The cost base figure will remain the same as your ‘Total’ though.![Buy New no Rollover](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4YWu4Ca3oIMMUIUGe4S0qW/55ec39f3d41206f9ed5ef0a07f0a89cc/Buy_New_no_Rollover.png?w=950)Again,
  remember to enter a ‘Market Price’, so that Sharesight can correctly track performance
  of your holding in the new company, from the Implementation Date going forward.
  Click ‘Save This Holding’.\n\n**All done! You’ve now accounted for the Afterpay
  and Touchcorp merger. As mentioned above, these steps are applicable if you’ve opted
  for rollover relief.**\n\n###### Note using this approach means that your CGT Report
  will not account for any CGT discount if you choose to sell your newly acquired
  Afterpay Touch Group shares in the next 12 Months. For tax purposes, you may consider
  backdating the opening balance date as required when you run a CGT report, or downloading
  the CGT report into Excel format and making a manual adjustment.\n\n## No Rollover
  Relief?\n\nIf you will not be opting for [rollover relief](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/takeovers-and-mergers,-scrip-for-scrip-rollover/)
  in the treatment of your Afterpay or Touchcorp shares, concerning this merger, there
  are a couple of different steps to take.\n\nFirstly, when entering a ‘Sell’ trade
  for your Afterpay shares, the ‘Sell’ price will need to reflect the ‘Market Price’
  of your new Afterpay Touch Group shares, as at the Implementation Date. At the time
  of writing, there has been no official indication of what price to be used, so we
  suggest using the closing price for the 6th of July, 2017, which was $3.15. If you
  held **Touchcorp** shares, you will need to enter a ‘Sell’ price that is proportionate
  to the ratio that determined your new Afterpay Touch Group quantity - our suggestion
  is: Price = 0.64 x $3.15 = $2.016.\n![Sell TCH no Rollover](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/34BlcpFqc8Y0c0CIUma0SC/f4f05b03f400ecd3d2ec423ab885edb7/NEW_Sell_TCH_no_Rollover.png?w=950)This
  will allow you to correctly reflect the proceeds received for your Touchcorp shares,
  which is the value of your new shares. Any capital gain or loss, as a result of
  this transaction, will be reflected in the Capital Gains Tax report. \nThe second
  difference, if not opting for rollover relief, is that when entering the new Afterpay
  Touch Group holding, the cost base should reflect the ‘Market Value’. You can actually
  use a Buy transaction in this instance, using your new quantity in Afterpay Touch
  Group, and the market price of $3.15 (closing price on 06/07/2017).![Buy New no
  Rollover](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4YWu4Ca3oIMMUIUGe4S0qW/55ec39f3d41206f9ed5ef0a07f0a89cc/Buy_New_no_Rollover.png?w=950)\n\n######
