:title: What investors need to know about stock splits
:content: "A stock split is a [corporate action](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-corporate-action/#:~:text=Sharesight%20and%20corporate%20actions,via%20our%20email%20notification%20feature.)
  that occurs when a company divides the existing shares of its stock into multiple
  new shares, resulting in a new share price and investors owning more shares relative
  to the ratio of the split. While the number of outstanding shares in the market
  increases, as well as the price per share, the company’s market capitalisation remains
  the same. \n\nIf a company you invest in is considering a stock split, now is the
  time to consider the implications this can have on your investment portfolio. This
  article will explain the different types of stock splits, explore recent examples,
  and show how Sharesight helps you track the impact of splits on your portfolio.\n\n![image

  Types of stock splits\n\nWhen assessing the effect of a stock split on your portfolio,
  it is important to establish whether it’s a forward or reverse split, what the stock
  split ratio will be, and when exactly this split will take effect. Knowing whether
  the company is issuing a forward or reverse split is particularly relevant, as this
  can be an indicator of the stock’s health.\n\n### Forward stock split\n\nThe most
  common form of a stock split is a forward stock split. The primary reason behind
  forward stock splits is that a company’s share price has increased to a price that
  is unattainable for the average retail investor – such as Berkshire Hathaway’s price
  of over US$300,000/share in 2020. While a stock split doesn’t change the value of
  the shares, it tends to have a psychological impact on investors whereby stocks
  that previously seemed out of reach are now much more accessible. This is particularly
  the case in markets where it is only possible to [buy whole shares like the ASX
  & NZX](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-fractional-shares-on-any-stock-exchange/),
  and not fractional units.  \n\nIn a hypothetical example of a forward stock split,
  a company with a share price of $300 may decide to initiate a 3-for-1 split, reducing
  the share price from $300/share to $100/share and tripling the amount of outstanding
  shares in the market, with investors now owning 3 shares for every 1 share they
  owned previously. \n\nIn a real world example of forward stock splits, US tech giant
  Apple has conducted four stock splits since it went public in 1980 at a price of
  US$22/share, with the latest being a [4-for-1 split in August 2020](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/30/apple-announces-four-for-one-stock-split),
  as the share price edged towards US$400.\n\nThe most recent stock split brought
  Apple’s price per share down to US$129, which the company hopes will make it psychologically
  more appealing for investors, and increase potential gains for shareholders.\n\n###
  Reverse stock split\n\nWhile forward stock splits are the most common, it is also
  possible for a company to initiate a [reverse stock split, also known as a consolidation](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidations/).
  As the name suggests, this is the opposite of a forward stock split, however in
  this case, shares are consolidated, rather than split. This means investors will
  end up owning less shares than they did previously, but with a higher share price
  at the same value as their existing investment. Typically, a company will perform
  a reverse split when its stock price is declining and the company needs to maintain
  a certain price to remain listed on an exchange. \n\nOne example of this is Helios
  and Matheson Analytics (NASDAQ: HMNY), which conducted a [250-for-1 split in 2018](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180724005853/en/Helios-Matheson-Analytics-Announces-1-for-250-Reverse-Stock)
  to boost its share price. This worked initially, but the share price dropped dramatically
  as investors realised how much their shares could be diluted when the company issued
  new shares to raise capital. \n\n## How stock splits impact your investment portfolio\n\nThe
  main impacts of stock splits are on an investor’s quantity of shares and cost base
  per share. The [cost base](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/at-a-glance-cost-base-per-share/)
  of a stock refers to the price when it was first purchased, as well as additional
  costs associated with purchasing, holding and selling the stock. This remains unchanged
  following a split or consolidation, however the cost base per share will increase
  or decrease as a result of changes in the quantity of shares owned. \n\nIn calculating
  cost base per share, consider this example: You own 10 shares of a company, purchased
  at $100/share. If the company issues a 2-for-1 stock split, you would own 20 shares
  at a cost base of $50/share. This change in cost base per share and quantity of
  shares is something you will need to keep track of for tax purposes. \n\nFor investors
  selling their shares, it becomes very important to know how many shares you have
  following a split. Using the numbers above, if you wanted to sell 25% of your shares
  following a split, you would need to remember to double the number of units from
  2.5 to 5, or risk making an incorrect trade. \n\nManually keeping track of upcoming
  stock splits and recording all the changes in price, quantity and cost base per
  share can be quite tedious, especially if you have a large portfolio and invest
  in growing companies. Having a tool that automates this process saves time and ensures
  accuracy, which is crucial for tax reporting and tracking the performance of your
  portfolio. \n\n## How Sharesight can help track stock splits\n\nWith Sharesight,
