  worldwide, it’s easier than ever to track your investment portfolio with Sharesight.
  Investors can automatically import historical and ongoing buy and sell trades into
  a Sharesight portfolio using the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  sent by most brokers, which is a convenient way to keep your portfolio up-to-date.\n\nE\\*TRADE
  Financial is one of the many brokers from which you can automatically import trades
  directly into your Sharesight portfolio. This gives United States investors the
  opportunity to leverage Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features.\n\n![image 0 Etrade](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7xR4XEuXrinlrnLle7156s/b5ba99d22ed34f352c136c326d137c6e/image_0_Etrade.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is E\\*TRADE Financial?\n\n[E-Trade Financial Corporation](https://us.etrade.com/home)
  (or E\\*TRADE) is a US-based discount broker that was established in 1982. The company’s
  online trading platform allows investors to purchase a range of US stocks, ETFs,
  mutual/managed funds and fixed income investments, with brokerage fees from $0.
  E\\*TRADE also provides research tools such as trading ideas, investment news and
  charting tools. Morgan Stanley announced its intention to [acquire the broker](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2020/02/28/morgan-stanley-grows-its-brokerage-business-with-e-trade-acquisition/#3e2dee4632fb)
  in 2020.\n\n## Import your E\\*TRADE data to Sharesight\n\nSharesight allows you
  to import your historical and ongoing trades in US stocks and ETFs through the [Trade
  Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/#:~:text=Each%20time%20an%20email%20with,in%20Sharesight%20via%20an%20email.)
  feature, or you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading
  a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet\n\nOne
  simple way to import historical trades to Sharesight is by creating and formatting
  a [ spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1) filled
  with trades from your trading account.\n\n![image 1 Etrade](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3krSFlTs9opUHWJhJ6LlC1/f03eacd44750e35b2f85db2be1185fd0/image_1_Etrade.png?w=950)
  \n\nAs long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio.\n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** This feature is designed primarily for ongoing
  trades, but it can also be used to fill in historical trades in your Sharesight
  portfolio. All you need to do is manually forward the Trade Confirmation Emails
  for the trades you wish to see in your portfolio, starting with the earliest trade
  you want included.\n\n## Get started with Sharesight\n\nJoin thousands of investors
