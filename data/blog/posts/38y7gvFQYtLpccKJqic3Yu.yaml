:title: What are the advantages and disadvantages of family trusts?
:url_slug: family-trusts-investing
:content: "Most people tend to follow a pattern in life. They go to school, obtain
  qualifications, get a job, pay taxes, and eventually settle down with a family.
  During this time, many make investments and even start a business to increase their
  wealth and assets. You can either own those wealth and assets in your name or set
  an alternative structure, like a family trust to hold them. Doing so could assist
  with your tax planning, asset protection and obtaining tax benefits.\n\nThis article
  discusses the advantages and disadvantages of family trusts.\n\n![family trusts](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1w9RP9BUdtBGreZ3XZig3v/6b958204ec3cd441ee6b03a21d7a21e9/family_trusts.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What are family trusts?\n\nA [family trust](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/trusts/in-detail/family-trusts---concessions/)
  is a discretionary trust that is used in Australia to hold the wealth and assets
  of a family. It is also commonly used as the structure for family businesses.\n\nA
  trust is a legal structure under which a person (the trustee) holds the legal title
  of a property for the benefit of other people (the beneficiaries). The trustee has
  a wide range of powers to deal with the property, and any profits generated from
  that property are distributed to the beneficiaries.\n\nA discretionary trust is
  a type of trust structure. The most distinguishing feature of a discretionary trust
  is that the trustee has the discretion on how much to distribute to each beneficiary
  if any money is distributed at all. The beneficiaries are not guaranteed to be paid;
  they just have an expectation of being paid.\n\nIn family trusts, the beneficiaries
  are usually members of the same family, and a person from the family or a company
  controlled by the family will be the trustee. This trustee has broad discretion
  including discretion on the distribution of the income from the trust. As a result,
  family trusts can be a useful tool to protect your assets, lower the amount you
  pay in tax and limit your risk exposure.\n\nLet us look at some of the advantages
  and disadvantages of a family trust.\n\n| Advantages   | Disadvantages    |\n| ----------
  | ---------- |\n| Tax planning   | Ability to grow if used to run a business       |\n|
  Asset protection   | Family disputes   |\n| 50% capital gains tax discount      |
  Liability of the trustee    |\n| Carry forward losses     |        |\n\n## Advantages
  of family trusts\n\n### 1. Tax planning\n\nA family trust is taxed at the highest
  income tax rate, which is 45%. However, any trust income distributed to the beneficiaries
  is taxed at the income tax rate of the beneficiary who receives the distribution.\n\nA
  family trust is commonly used to minimise the total income tax paid by the whole
  family. Generally, the trustee in a family trust distributes the trust income among
  the trust's beneficiaries and allocates more distribution for a family member with
  a lower income tax rate than the other parties. This reduces the total amount of
  tax paid on the trust income by the beneficiaries.\n\n### 2. Asset protection\n\nA
  family trust structure can protect your family's wealth from creditors. Usually,
  when a person owes money and cannot meet the repayment requirements, the creditor
  can access the person's personal asset to recoup the debt payable. Personal assets
  include your home, car, and other property a person owns in their name.  If the
  family trust is holding the personal assets, then the trust's beneficiary has no
  legal rights over those personal properties. Therefore, the creditors of the beneficiaries
  cannot access them. This includes even if a beneficiary becomes bankrupt.\n\n###
  3. 50% capital gains tax discount\n\nA capital gains tax is payable on any profits
  you make from the sale of an asset. A family trust can get a 50% discount on capital
  gains tax for any profit made from selling any assets the trust has held for more
  than 12 months.\n\n### 4. Carry forward losses\n\nA trust does not distribute any
  losses to the beneficiaries. This means the beneficiaries will not be called upon
  to contribute money to the trust to meet any loss. Instead, losses from each year
  can be carried forward to the following year.\n\n## Disadvantages of family trusts\n\n###
  1. Grow as a business\n\nAs mentioned above, a family trust is also used sometimes
  as the business structure for family businesses. While this structure offers benefits
  like those outlined above, it restrains a business's ability to grow. Due to the
  high tax applied to trust income that is not distributed, trustees almost always
  distribute the income. Therefore, the business cannot retain the profits to reinvest
  in the business for the following years. Lenders like banks are also reluctant to
  lend to trust structures when compared to other business structures like a company.\n\n###
  2. Family disputes\n\nIt is usual for families to have disputes. Disputes about
  the control of the trust can occur where the trust holds a significant amount of
  family wealth. If the trust deed does not clearly set out the procedure to appoint
  or replace a trustee and how the trust income should be distributed, then it is
  more likely for family disputes to occur. To avoid such disputes, the trust deed
  must set out clear procedures to address these points.  \n\n### 3. Liability of
  the trustee\n\nA family trust provides excellent protection for beneficiaries both
  from an asset protection and tax planning perspective. However, a trustee is legally
  liable for the obligations of the trust, including any debts it owes. This can cause
  significant personal risk to the trustee if the trustee is an individual. This is
  why a company is often used as the trustee.\n\n## Should you set a family trust?\n\nThat
  will depend on your personal circumstances. You will need to get independent legal
  and financial advice to determine if a family trust structure could benefit you
  and your family. Given the benefits, it is worth considering. However, please note
  that transferring your existing assets to a family trust will come with tax implications.\n\n##
  Key takeaway\n\nA family trust is a trust structure that families tend to use to
  hold their wealth because of the benefits like asset protection, tax planning, capital
  gains tax discount and ability to carry forward losses. However, it comes with certain
  disadvantages, such as:\n\n●      the ability to grow if the structure is used for
  a business;\n\n●      dealing with family disputes; and\n\n●      liability of the
  trustee.\n\nIf you need help with setting up a family trust, LegalVision’s experienced
