:title: ASX IPOs in 2018 averaged 8% return 1 month after listing
:content: "###### [Sharesight partner OnMarket](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/onmarket/)
  leverages Sharesight to calculate returns on IPOs through the [OnMarket platform](https://www.onmarket.com.au/).
  In this post, OnMarket's Managing Director Tim Eisenhauer shares some key data and
  findings from OnMarket’s 2018 IPO report.\n\nDespite some reports about the [death
  of IPOs](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/private-inequity/570808/),
  a more careful analysis reveals opportunities for investors to reap significant
  returns from a simple and systemic approach.\n\nThe 95 IPOs that listed in 2018
  were up, on average, 8% one month after their respective listing dates.  Consequently,
  a model portfolio created by a strategy of investing the same amount into every
  IPO in 2018, and selling one-month post listing, yielded a gross (pre-brokerage,
  pre-tax) annualised return of 70.8%*. This calculation takes into account that each
  investment into an IPO, earnt an average of 8% per IPO for 1 month before the shares
  were sold (and the funds reinvested).\n\n## OnMarket 2018 IPO Report\n\nThe [OnMarket
  2018 IPO Report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/SlWpYHlue2vGo5sAOhplv/a3ff294c8bf4778e52ebcfc97e4219c6/OnMarket_Annual_IPO_Report_2018_FINAL_Sharesight.pdf)
  which details Australian Initial Public Offering activity for 2018, includes performance
  methodology that measures each IPO for the same period post listing.  This gives
  a truer reflection of actual IPO performance than measuring all IPOs at 31 December,
  as some will have been listed for 12 months, and some for less than a week at that
  date.\n\nIn 2018 the average IPO was 11% higher at the close of the first day than
  the issue price.  Medicinal cannabis company Althea Group Holdings recorded the
  highest 1 day return of 180%. Holding onto IPO shares for a longer period post listing
  was not a winning strategy in 2018, with the average IPO performance falling from
  8% up after one month to 0.3% after 3 months.  A strategy of buying every IPO and
  selling after 3 months delivered 1.1%*, which outperformed the Small Ordinaries
  index, which was down 11.3% for the 12 months to 31 December.\n\nThe total amount
  raised in Australia through IPOs in 2018 was $7.8b, which is an increase from the
  $6.0b raised in 2017, this was despite the number of IPOs listing on the ASX falling
  year on year, from 113 to 95.  Consumer Staples was again the best performing sector,
  returning 37.1% over 3 months and 21.8% to 31 December.\n\n## 2018 ASX top 10 IPO

  ASX IPO sector performance in 2018\n\nThe Materials sector again provided the most
  number of new listings, with 35 companies joining the ASX.  This continues the trend
  of the previous year where Materials made up 31% of listings in 2017.  Listed Investment
  Companies (LICs) were less abundant than in previous years, almost halving in the
  number of listings to 13, and funds raised to a total of $2.5b.\n\nInformation Technology
  was the only sector to increase the actual total number of listings from the previous
  year, increasing from 11 to 17 listings, reflecting the ASX’s ongoing emphasis to
  be an attractive listing exchange, especially in Asia for Information Technology
  companies. \n\nThe sector had four of the top 10 best performing IPOs for 2018,
  led by PayGroup Ltd +63.9%, and e-learning solutions platform ReadCloud +57.5%.
  \ Environmental technology company Calix Ltd +50.0% and digital security provider
  Security Matters +47.5% completed the four best performing Information Technology
  sector listings.\n\nMany of the best performing IPOs in 2018 came from companies
  of health products and services.  This was led by returns at 31 December of biopharmaceutical
  manufacturer Exopharm +175.0%, Elixinol Global +150.0% a manufacturer and producer
  of CBD hemp oil, Emvision Medical Devices +40.0%, and medicinal cannabis producer
  Althea Group Holdings +22.5%.\n\n\n###### Download and read the PDF of the [full
