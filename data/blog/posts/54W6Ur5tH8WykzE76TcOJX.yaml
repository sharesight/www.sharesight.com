:content: "When it comes to building wealth for retirement, the sooner you start,
  the sooner the magic of compounding kicks in. Whether you prefer stocks, bonds,
  property, alternative assets or a combination of those things, time in the market
  can help your portfolio reach great heights.\n\n \n\nSo if you’ve already started
  your wealth-building journey – congratulations. If you haven’t – today is the perfect
  time to begin.\n\n![3 tips to maximise your retirement savings](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6HBmXmR9TcuEKs8924AGFB/f257ddd25cff85d9e89d3594b6c379d9/3_tips_to_maximise_your_retirement_savings.jpg?w=950)\n\nWhen
  planning for your post-work life, the first question to ask is: \"How much money
  will I need to fund a comfortable retirement?\" You can then work backwards to calculate
  how much you need to save and invest each year.\n\n \n\n‘Comfortable’ means different
  things to different people, so everyone will have different numbers. But one principle
  that everyone can apply is a rule of thumb known as the ‘4% rule’.\n\n \n\nThis
  is the result of a[ famous study](https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/Portfolio%20Success%20Rates%20Where%20to%20Draw%20the%20Line.aspx)
  by professors at Trinity University in Texas, who found that, based on historical
  stock market results and inflation data, you should never run out of money in retirement
  if you withdraw a maximum of 4% of your savings each year. In other words, your
  long-term market returns should always exceed a 4% withdrawal rate plus inflation.\n\n
  \n\nOf course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. But if you
  do want to use the [4% rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp),
  it's easy to apply. All you have to do is calculate your annual expenses, multiply
  by 25 and you have your investing target. So if you spend $50,000 per year, you’d
  need $1.25 million to fund a comfortable retirement (because 4% of $1.25 million
  is $50,000). If you spend $100,000 per year, you’d need $2.5 million.\n\n \n\nOnce
  you've calculated your investing target, you can use these three tips to maximise
  your investment returns for retirement.\n\n \n\n## 1) Exploit the power of compounding\n\n
  \n\nCompound accumulation is a powerful force. For example, if you start with an
  investment of $50,000 in stocks that returns 7% per annum, and you automatically
  reinvest your dividends, your investment will be worth $380,613 after 30 years.\n\n
  \n\nBut your investment portfolio doesn’t stand still. If you start with that $50,000
  initial investment, and invest an additional $10,000 annually, your portfolio will
  be worth $1,325,221 after 30 years. Comparing the start and end of that 30-year
  cycle is revealing. At the end of year one, you've invested $50,000 and earned $3,500.
  By the end of year 30, you've invested $350,000 and earned $975,221. That's the
  power of compounding.\n\n \n\n## 2) Reinvest your dividends\n\n\nThe fastest way
  to grow your portfolio is to reinvest your dividends. Commonly known as a [dividend
  reinvestment plan, DRP or DRIP](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/),
  \ investors can opt-in to have their dividends reinvested automatically - which
  offers two key advantages:\n\n\n●      You get to buy new stocks without paying
  brokerage fees\n\n●      You can take advantage of[ dollar-cost averaging](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/)\n\nBrokerage
  fees, over the long term, can be surprisingly costly. For example, let’s say dividend
  reinvestment saves you $100 per year in brokerage. If we again assume a 7% return,
  that compounds to $10,200 over 30 years.\n\n \n\nBesides saving on brokerage fees,
  you also get to use dollar-cost averaging, which is a strategy endorsed by Warren
  Buffett. [Dollar-cost averaging](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/)
  involves investing a set amount of money (in this case, your dividends) at a set
  time (whenever you receive dividends), whether the market is going up, down or sideways.
  When we automate our investing in this way, we eliminate the cognitive biases that
  often harm our results.\n\n \n\nDon’t be intimidated by the thought of having to
  track all those reinvested dividends and calculate their returns –[ Sharesight’s
  tracks DRPs all that for you](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/).\n\n\n##
  3) Capitalise on retirement tax concessions\n\n \n\nMany governments offer retirement
  vehicles and incentives, such as[ SMSFs in Australia](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/),[
  KiwiSaver accounts in New Zealand](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-do-i-track-my-kiwisaver-fund/),
  and[ RRSPs and RRIFs in Canada](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/rrsp-and-rrif-canadian-tax-settings-in-sharesight-portfolios/).\n\n
  \n\n●      **Australia –** you invest pre-tax income into superannuation, which
  is then taxed at 15%, compared to a top tax rate of 45%. If you choose to use an
  SMSF for your super, you control how those funds are invested.\n\n \n\n●      **New
  Zealand –** if you opt in to KiwiSaver, your employer will make a contribution equivalent
  to 3% of your salary. The government will also give you 50c for every $1 you invest
  (up to an annual limit of $521.43).\n\n \n\n●      **Canada –** if you establish
  an RRSP, any deductible contributions you make will reduce your taxable income,
  while the funds will generally be tax-exempt while they remain in the plan. If you
  transfer assets from an RRSP to an RRIF, your earnings will be tax-free, although
  distributions will be taxable.\n\n \n\nInvestors would be wise to research these
  schemes. Again, it’s all about the power of compounding: even a modest tax saving
  or government payment each year can grow into a sizeable amount when compounded
  over decades.\n\n \n\n## What gets measured gets managed\n\n \n\nYour retirement
  may be decades away, but there’s no time to waste in building your retirement income.
  The investment decisions you make today could deliver tens of thousands or even
  hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of compounded returns by the time you retire.\n\n
  \n\nAs they say, what gets measured gets managed. That’s why investors building
