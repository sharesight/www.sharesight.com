:title: Share records you must keep to complete your tax return
:url_slug: share-records-you-must-keep-to-complete-your-tax-return
:content: "When it comes down to it, the person responsible for keeping up-to-date
  and accurate records of your shareholdings for the tax department is you. That’s
  right, whether you complete your own return or work with an Accountant or Tax Agent
  (adviser), the buck stops with you. \n\nIn Australia, for example the ATO requires
  that\\*:\n\n### You must keep the following share records:\n\n- your acquisition
  and disposal statements (your 'buy' and 'sell' Trade Confirmations) -- keep these
  records for five years from the date you dispose of your shares\n- your dividend
  statements -- keep these records for five years from 31 October or, if you lodge
  later, for five years from the date you lodge your tax return.\n\n### You will receive
  most of the records you need to keep from:\n\n- the company that issued the shares\n-
  your stockbroker or online share trading provider\n- your financial institution,
  if you took out a loan to buy the shares.\n\n<small>*Source: Australian Government
  Australian Taxation Office website. View the [ATO’s full explanation of records
  you need to keep](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/In-detail/Keeping-your-tax-records/)</small>\n\nNo
  matter how organised you are, that’s a lot of paperwork for you to manage and store,
  and a lot of data for your adviser to sift through and enter into the appropriate
  forms. So that means work for you and your adviser, and subsequently, cost for you.\n\nThe
  good news is that [Sharesight](/) updates and maintains all of these records for
  you. Once you set up a portfolio in Sharesight then all you need to do is arrange
  for your broker to [send Trade Confirmation Emails to that portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/),
  and your trades will be automatically recorded - with the appropriate trade confirmation
  attached to each trade! From then on all your dividends (franked and un-franked
  amounts), current share prices, and any relevant corporate action information affecting
  your earnings are automatically updated in Sharesight. Everything you need is ready
  to give to your adviser and ready for tax time!\n\nThe other good news is that you
  can [share your Sharesight portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/)
  with your adviser so that they can access all these records and data when they need
  them as well. This means that they are confident that your records are accurate,
  spend less time entering data, and, have more time available to consult with you
  regarding any capital gains on shareholdings. This saves your adviser a lot of frustration
  and helps you achieve your best tax outcome!\n\nIt may be that your Accountant or
  Tax Agent is already using Sharesight. We have a Professional Edition of Sharesight
  that allows advisers such as Accountants, Bookkeepers, Tax Agents and Financial
  Planners to administer client share portfolios. If you would like your adviser to
  learn more about Sharesight please ask them to visit [Sharesight Pro](/pro/).\n\n###
