:title: Will Mighty River’s share price sink or swim?
:url_slug: will-mighty-rivers-share-price-sink-or-swim
:content: "The NZ Government’s asset sales programme has generated heated debate much
  of which has been politically driven and ill-informed. But whatever side of the
  fence you are on, the bottom line is that it is going to happen at least for Mighty
  River Power which is the first cab off the rank. So as an investor are you going
  to dip your toe in the water or do you think investing in Mighty River will leave
  you up the creek without a paddle?\n\nRather than regurgitating all the factors
  that might impact on Mighty River’s share price after it floats I thought it might
  be interesting to look at how previous Government asset sales have performed for
  investors over the long term. Three that come to mind are Auckland Airport, Contact
  Energy and Vector. Recording these stocks in [Sharesight](/) on their IPO dates
  reveals some interesting information. \n\nContact Energy is obviously the most relevant
  to Mighty River. It listed in May 1999 and since then has produced an electrifying
  performance with an annualised return (including capital gains and dividends) of
  just under 15%. However it has suffered a power cut since September 2010 producing
  a total return over this period of minus 2.6%.\n\nOn the other hand Vector, being
  a lines company rather than a power producer, has seen its share price become tangled
  in the wires and it is currently below its August 2005 listing price of $3.00. But
  it has still produced an overall return of 5.6% courtesy of strong regular dividend
  payments.\n\nAuckland Airport has been the high flyer of the trio with an overall
  performance of nearly 22% p.a. since it became airborne in July 1998. It is obviously
  in a different industry and has some unique characteristics, but it does show that
  previously owned Government assets can perform for investors and are unlikely to
  sell you down the river.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Help -- [Initial Public Offering
