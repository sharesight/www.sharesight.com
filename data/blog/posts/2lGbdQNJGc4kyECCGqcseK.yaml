:title: ETF and managed fund tax improvements for Australians
:url_slug: etf-and-managed-fund-tax-improvements-for-australians
:content: "The changes introduced as part of [Australia’s new Attribution Managed
  Investment Trust (AMIT) regime](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  mean the annual taxation statements from trusts (such as managed funds and ETFs)
  can contain as many as 17 distribution and 2 capital gain components. These components
  must be correctly recorded across all the trusts investors earn income from when
  they complete their [Tax Return for Individuals 2018 form](https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Tax-return-for-individuals-2018/).
  \ This can be a complex and time-consuming process.\n\nFortunately, we’ve been working
  hard at Sharesight to build solutions to make [ETF tax admin easy for Australians](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/),
  and have just completed another major initiative to improve how you can use Sharesight
  to complete your tax return if you invest in ETFs or managed funds.\n\n## Trust
  tax components in Australia\n\nTrusts only finalise the tax components in the annual
  taxation statement issued by the trustee at the end of the financial year. As a
  result, the break down of the components across the (usually quarterly) distributions
  paid by the trust are subject to change at year end. Sharesight has been able to
  source the final year end tax components for ETFs registered with Computershare,
  but for ETFs using  different registries, or managed funds / unit trusts not registered
  with Computershare, investors will need to manually record the year-end tax components
  annually in Sharesight, which is where our latest feature comes in.\n\n![VAS tax
  statement for forum](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6rJOSdqpNeo26WK2ccgYKU/b3607f66474de309398f8bee173c7341/VAS_tax_statement_for_forum.PNG)\n\n##
  Sharesight’s trust pro rata distributions components form\n\nSharesight automatically
  records the value of distributions paid during the year by ETFs and managed funds
  from our data partners at the ASX and Morningstar. But because the final tax component
  break down is only available in the annual taxation statement, we’ve built \na solution
  to easily record these in Sharesight and pro rata the components against the \ndistributions
  received during the year (or the part of year) the trust was held.\n\nWhen running
  Sharesight’s [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/taxable_income/#1)
  the trust pro rata distributions components form can be used to enter these values
  when a date range is selected for a financial year and ‘Show holding totals’ is
  selected in the ‘advanced options’.\n\n![ETF annual tax components](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/121e0CHhigK6KiQIqQaYoE/f0ae3432a84bc2181b627f17160fa371/ETF_annual_tax_components.png?w=950)\n\nYou
  just need to click on the ‘Enter Annual Tax Statement Components’ button and enter
  the tax components from the annual tax statement into the form. This will then pro
  rata the components across the distributions for the trust. Once the trust tax components
  are provided, they will pass through to the ‘Tax Return’ section of Sharesight’s
  Taxable Income Report to make completing your *Tax Return for Individuals 2018*
  form straightforward.\n\nBefore using this form, make sure to read our [Taxable
  Income Report Trust pro rata distributions components form works help page](https://help.sharesight.com/au/taxable_income/#1)
  which goes into detail on the various components and how the form works.\n\n###
  Important notes:\n\n1. __If you are completing your tax return using the ATO’s online
  myTax system, trust component distribution data for *each* ETF may already be pre
  filled and just needs to be checked against your annual tax statements or entered
  directly from these__\n2. The component names may differ between your annual tax
  statement and the fields used in Sharesight - [this image](https://images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/bKPqGydoJyYmCkEcESOWm/bdd4e5beaa00db9708071d65159a5eb2/AMITCostBasedecreaseexample.png?w=950)
  will give you a good guide to how the fields map to Sharesight for Computershare
  ETFs\n3. Your cash position for each distribution will remain unchanged (subject
  to some minor rounding). This is important when calculating performance, DRPs and
  for reconciliation with Xero. \n4. In order to enter the correct AMIT components
  and retain the same Net Cash Amount, you need to have the correct Tax Details entered.
  \n5. If you are considering using our Income Tax Return section on the Taxable Income
  Report, you will need to ensure you have the correct tax detail entered for each
  ETF in your portfolio. \n6. The [Trust pro rata distributions components form](https://help.sharesight.com/au/taxable_income/#1)
  works for ETFs, Managed Funds and Unit Trusts as well. \n7. If you have synced your
  portfolio to Xero’s cloud accounting software, you may need to do some additional
  work to reflect the payout changes in Xero.\n8. Even for Computershare registered
  ETFs we recommend reconciling your annual tax statement against the numbers automatically
  populated in Sharesight to be sure of their accuracy.\n\n### Tax time webinar with
