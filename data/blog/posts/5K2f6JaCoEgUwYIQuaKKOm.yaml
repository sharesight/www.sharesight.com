:title: Improved LIC capital gain reporting for Australian investors
:content: "Just in time for FY2017/2018 tax returns we’ve added a helpful new feature
  to Sharesight to assist Australian investors in Listed Investment Companies (LICs).\n\n##
  What’s new? \n\nBecause of the way the [Australian Tax Office (ATO) treats capital
  gains in dividends from LICs](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/CGT-listed-investment-companies-concession/)
  these need to be treated differently from a normal dividend payment. We’ve now added
  an additional ‘LIC Capital Gain’ field to the dividend payout form to correctly
  record this payment.\n\n![LIC Capital Gain](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6KYd6eKqtySUIIoGEyewyo/164efa47b72170a038ab81e5fc13f416/LIC_Capital_Gain.PNG)\n\nWhile
  Sharesight is unable to automatically populate this field with a figure (you’ll
  need to enter it manually once the LIC notifies you of these values) once entered
  the LIC Capital Gain value will be correctly shown as a deduction (at a rate of
  50% CGT discount) in the improved Sharesight taxable income report, to easily record
  in the D8 section of your income tax return.\n\n![Dividend deductions](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1CzxAzCksQosMi0CUYgYOw/1eb49e2f3cee666d4f1ca9e5cd30dbd7/Dividend_deductions.PNG)\n\n##
  Who will see this new LIC capital gains feature?\n\nOn payout forms:\n\n- A tax
  residency set to “Australia”\n\nOn the taxable income report:\n\n- A tax residency
  set to “Australia”\n\nOn the Income Tax Return section of the taxable income report:\n\n-
  A tax residency set to “Australia” and;\n- A tax entity type set to “Individual
  or Trust” (although it’s only relevant to individual tax entities)\n\n### Notes
  on the Income tax return section\n\n- The tax return field references are based
  on the tax return for individuals 2018 and tax return for individuals (supplementary
  section) 2018.\n- Sharesight does not provide taxation advice and this report does
  not constitute personal taxation advice. If you have any questions about your tax
  position we recommend you contact your accountant or tax advisor.\n\n## Share your
  feedback\nPlease share any feedback in our dedicated [LIC capital gains forum topic](https://c.getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/how-to-record-capital-gains-components-of-dividend-distributions).\n\n###
