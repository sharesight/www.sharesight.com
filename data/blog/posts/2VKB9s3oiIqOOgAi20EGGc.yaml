:title: Top 3 Australian investor trends in 2017
:content: "Every 5 years the [ASX’s Australian Share Ownership Study](https://www.asx.com.au/education/2017-asx-investor-study.htm)
  profiles investors to provide an understanding of retail investors, their perceptions,
  attitudes and behaviours. Sharesight has reviewed the report and identified three
  key trends, but first, here are the key figures:\n\nDid you know?\n\n- Australia
  has 11.2 million investors, or approximately 60% of the adult population\n- Of those,
  6.9 million hold investments through a financial exchange\n- For the median household,
  approximately 20% of their weekly income comes from their investments\n- Nearly
  half (45%) of investors reviewed their portfolios 3 times or fewer in the last year.
  (In contrast, only 19% of Sharesight users checked their portfolios 3 times or less
  in the past 12 months, with 71% checking their portfolio 9 times or more.)\n\nNow
  let's dive into the three key trends among Australian investors:\n\n![Featured-australian-investor-trends](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/12fIgjautwWQQce8gycOsG/31dd390cc28b38cf0777b32223a8028c/Featured-australian-investor-trends.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Self-Managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF) use is booming\n\nOver 15% or 1.1 million
  Australians claim to be members of a self-managed super fund, with the ASX finding
  that 30% of Australian adults that do not currently use an SMSF plan to set one
  up in the future -- a whopping 13% in the next 12 months. Of those planning to establish
  an SMSF, 65% of them already invest elsewhere in either on-exchange or other investment
  products.\n\nThere are now over 585,000 SMSFs in Australia according to the [ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/About-ATO/Research-and-statistics/In-detail/Super-statistics/SMSF/Self-managed-super-fund-quarterly-statistical-report---March-2017/)
  -- meaning [self-managed superannuation funds have grown by 20%](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/smsfs-up-20-since-2012/)
  in the last 5 years.\n\nAmong Sharesight users, 39% of our Australian customers
  on a paid plan currently [track a SMSF using Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-unbundling-and-how-much-can-it-save-me/).\n\n##
  Investors are highly risk averse, not diversified\n\n[Australian investors are highly
  risk averse](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/does-your-investment-portfolio-match-your-appetite-for-risk/),
  with 70% seeking stable, reliable or guaranteed returns -- this is even higher among
  millennials with 81% of investors under 35 seeking guaranteed or stable returns.\n\n[Diversification
  is a useful way to manage risk](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/diversity-reporting-now-available/),
  yet the level of diversification within Australian investors portfolios is low,
  with 46% of investors claiming to hold a diversified portfolio. Of those claiming
  to hold a diversified portfolio, they hold an average of 2.7 investment products
  (shares, property and/or cash typically). Some 40% of respondents to the ASX study
  said they weren’t diversified, with an average of 1.6 products.\n\nAlarmingly 75%
  of Australian share owners only own Australian shares. Given how top-heavy the ASX
  is (with the top ten shares accounting for [43% of the market value](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/john-durie/big-four-banks-dominate-topheavy-bourse/news-story/9a2ffe798a4bb1103f96c2cc327bd9a3)
  and [60% of the value](https://www.firstsamuel.com.au/what-are-you-looking-for/investment-matters/coca-cola-wesfarmers-ten-network-and-contra-emeco/correct-the-inherent-risk-of-the-australian-share-market/)
  of the ASX made up by companies in the finance, materials or real estate sectors),
  the vast majority are really only invested in a handful of companies and sectors.\n\nFortunately
  ownership of international shares is increasing, with the nearly 8% of the adult
  population surveyed by the ASX holding shares listed on an international financial
  exchange, up from 5% in 2014.\n\n## Millennial Investors almost double in 5 years\n\n[Millennial
  investors are smashing the myth](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/millennial-investors-smash-avocado-myth-in-asx-report/)
  that they are imprudent investors, spending all their income buying expensive cafe
  breakfasts. Young investors (18-24yo) now make up 20% of all investors in Australia,
  doubling since 2012. Similarly the number of ‘Gen Y’ investors (25-34yo) has boomed
  over the same period increasing from 24% to 39% of the Australian investor population.\n\nMillennial
  investors are highly risk averse, with 4 in 5 young investors (18-25) preferring
  guaranteed or stable investment returns, making them the most risk averse of any
  age group among Australian investors. \n\nYoung investors are more digitally savvy,
  willing to embrace automated investment advice ‘robo-advice’ platforms as offered
  by Sharesight partner [SixPark](https://www.sixpark.com.au/) at higher levels (15%)
  than investors aged 60 and over (4%). \n\nMillennial investors are strong adopters
  of mobile apps, with CommSec revealing over 50% of all trades made through their
  mobile app are by millennials. In addition among Sharesight users millennials are
  39% more likely to [track their investments on a mobile device](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-mobile-app--april-2017-update/).\n\n###
