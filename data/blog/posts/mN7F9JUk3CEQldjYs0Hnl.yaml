:title: Calculating taxable gains on share trading in New Zealand
:content: "While New Zealand’s proposed general capital gains tax (CGT) regime in
  2019 was [abandoned by Government](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/112010254/government-to-make-statement-on-capital-gains-tax)
  after much debate. Did you know that a tax on gains *already applies* to some investors
  who trade equity or foreign debt investments in New Zealand?\n\nHere, we break down
  who New Zealand’s capital gains tax currently applies to, and how to calculate losses/gains
  on share trading activity using Sharesight for tax purposes.\n\n![calculating taxable
  gains on share trading in new zealand](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2YqPC7DO9JxzpozMwXqol0/db3e1101aa592a5d54040955b7bc8e9f/calculating_taxable_gains_on_share_trading_in_new_zealand.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Taxable gains on shares in New Zealand\n\nWhile no general capital gains tax applies
  in New Zealand, tax on gains made may apply to NZ investors trading shares when:\n\n1.
  They purchase a property [with the intention to sell it](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/property/property-selling/selling-property.html)
  (this rule was introduced in 2016)\n\n2. They purchase shares or other investments
  *with the intention to sell it at a profit* (rather than hold the shares and earn
  income from holding them)\n\nIn these situations, the individual may be classified
  to be a \"Trader\" (as opposed to a regular investor) by the IRD.\n\n## When are
  gains made on shares taxed in NZ?\n\nUnfortunately [New Zealand’s IRD](https://www.ird.govt.nz/)
  provides very little information to investors on when the latter is ruled to apply.\n\nPer
  [Section 65 of the 2007 Income Tax Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0097/latest/versions.aspx),
  a gain is liable for income tax when:\n\n* The investor is in the business of dealing
  in shares, or\n\n* The shares were acquired with the dominant purpose of resale
  at a profit, or\n\n* The investor enters into a scheme or undertaking to make a
  profit from shares\n\n__In simpler terms:__\n\n1. The *intent* when purchasing the
  shares needs to be to make a gain when sold\n\n2. This needs to be the dominant
  purpose for the buying of these shares (rather than earning dividend income for
  example)\n\n### NZ may tax gains on shares when:\n\nThe IRD looks for a [number
  of behaviours](http://www.guide2.co.nz/money/questions/tax/at-what-point-does-a-stock-trader-need-to-pay-tax-on-profits/6/11477)
  in determining whether the investor is [undertaking a business](https://www.sharetrader.co.nz/showthread.php?8887-At-what-point-does-a-Investor-become-a-Trader-from-a-tax-perspective/page3)
  in dealing (or trading) in shares:\n\n* Individuals show a pattern of (usually frequent)
  buying and selling of shares over time\n\n* Individuals invest significant levels
  of capital in investments, in particular when investing on margin / borrowing to
  invest\n\n* Individuals monitor their investment portfolios closely, perhaps using
  an advanced online trading platform\n\n* Individuals spend a lot of time researching
  their investments \n\n* Individuals buy high risk shares to flip at a profit\n\n*
  Shares are bought and sold on ‘revenue’ account instead of capital account\n\n**New
  Zealand’s IRD tax rules are complex and the above should not be considered tax advice.**\n\n###
  Consult your accountant if you’re unsure\n\nWhile many Sharesight users tend to
  be \"buy and hold\" investors, who invest over the long term to earn dividends,
  New Zealand’s IRD may still judge the activity to be ‘trading’.  Even if you’re
  not an active trader, the issue of *intent* is very important, and Sharesight recommends
  consulting a registered accountant whether these rules apply to your circumstance.\n\n##
  Calculate gains/losses on NZ shares for tax purposes\n\nSharesight makes it easy
  to calculate gains (or losses) for share traders in New Zealand with our ‘Traders
  Tax’ report.\n\nSharesight’s Traders Tax report calculates any taxable gains, using
  one of four methods:\n\n* First-in, first-out (FIFO)\n\n* First-in, last-out (FILO)\n\n*
  Minimise capital gain (sell highest priced shares first)\n\n* Maximise capital gain
  (sell lowest priced shares first)\n\n**NZ’s IRD may require you to use a specific
  sale allocation method in your situation (often FIFO), consult your accountant for
  information specific to your situation.**\n\n![Sharesight - Traders Tax Report 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1foXro70ZUou2AYqWE1tNT/41e7a66d63da7080ab4ebf1f63f5a39a/sharesight-traders-tax-report-2019.png?w=950)\n\n##
