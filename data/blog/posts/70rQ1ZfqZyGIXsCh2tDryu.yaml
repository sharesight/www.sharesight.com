:title: Vanguard Brokerage Services can now be imported into Sharesight
:url_slug: easily-import-trades-from-vanguard-brokerage-services-into-sharesight
:content: "Sharesight now supports [over 170 brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  worldwide, making it easier than ever to track your investment portfolio. Investors
  can automatically import historical and ongoing buy and sell trades into a Sharesight
  portfolio through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  sent by most brokers, which is a convenient way to keep your portfolio up-to-date.
  \ \n\n[Vanguard Brokerage Services](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/transaction-fees-commissions/etfs)
  is one of the many brokers from which you can automatically import trades directly
  into your Sharesight portfolio. This allows investors in the United States to make
  the most of Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n## Who is Vanguard Brokerage Services?\n\n[Vanguard
  Brokerage Services](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/vanguard-brokerage)
  is a US-based trading service operating under [The Vanguard Group](https://about.vanguard.com/),
  which is best-known for its provision of mutual funds and ETFs. Geared towards long-term
  and low-cost investors, Vanguard Brokerage offers $0 brokerage fees for online trades
  in stocks and ETFs.\n\n## Import your Vanguard Brokerage data to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to import your historical and ongoing trades in US stocks and ETFs through
  the Trade Confirmation Emails feature, or you can choose to manually import your
  historical trades by uploading a spreadsheet file. Keep reading to learn more. \n\n##
  How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet \n\nOne simple way to import
  historical trades to Sharesight is by creating and formatting a [ spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1)
  filled with trades from your trading account.\n\n![Sharesight vanguard spreadsheet](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3tNUglqWMfGkbW8cU1DmOO/f08ed7ee515fd08884ce8a441b9f2a55/Sharesight_vanguard_spreadsheet.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio. \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** This feature is designed primarily for ongoing
  trades, but it can also be used to fill in historical trades in your Sharesight
  portfolio. All you need to do is manually forward the Trade Confirmation Emails
  for the trades you wish to see in your portfolio, starting with the earliest trade
  you want included. \n\n## We need your help to add more US brokers!\n\nSharesight
  is looking to add more US brokers to its [list of supported brokers](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/transaction-fees-commissions/etfs).
  If your broker is not yet on the list, let us know by leaving a message in the chat
  interface located at the bottom-right of Sharesight. All we will need from you is
  some sample buy and sell trade confirmations (email or PDF), the email the broker
  sends them from and the subject line of the emails.\n\nWe only require a few sample
  documents to support a new broker, so reach out today if you want to see yours added!\n\n###
