:content: "With support for [over 170 global brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/),
  it’s easier than ever to track your investment portfolio with Sharesight. We are
  always expanding our list of supported brokers, which now includes South African
  broker [Investec](https://www.investec.com/en_za.html), to complement our existing
  support for the [Johannesburg Stock Exchange (](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/global-markets-available-singapore-frankfurt-johannesburg/)[JSE)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/global-markets-available-singapore-frankfurt-johannesburg/).
  \n\nSouth African investors trading through [Investec](https://www.investec.com/en_za.html)
  can automatically import trades directly into their Sharesight portfolio, giving
  them access to Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n![image 0 Investec](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5weECOUwdFylFaIjM4j9ak/77721dcefc2e3e86f9be40bf28efa31d/image_0_Investec.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is Investec?\n\nEstablished in 1974, [Investec Limited](https://www.investec.com/en_za.html)
  is a South Africa-based investment and private banking group. The company offers
  traditional stockbroking services and an online trading platform, with access to
  global markets supported by Sharesight, including the JSE, LSE, TSE and ASX. Investec
  also offers a range of other services including equity research, advisory and wealth
  management. \n\n## Import your Investec data to Sharesight\n\nSharesight allows
  you to import your historical and ongoing trades in South African stocks and ETFs
  through the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  feature, or you can choose to manually import your historical trades by uploading
  a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet\n\nOne
  simple way to import historical trades to Sharesight is by creating and formatting
  a [ spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1) filled
  with trades from your trading account.\n\n![image 1 Investec](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5PuGXlrGgDOD3dmSmR37Ae/ccbdd11ef0273a19c980711f7dba2d33/image_1_Investec.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio.\n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** This feature is designed primarily for ongoing
  trades, but it can also be used to fill in historical trades in your Sharesight
  portfolio. All you need to do is manually forward the Trade Confirmation Emails
  for the trades you wish to see in your portfolio, starting with the earliest trade
  you want included.\n\n## Get started with Sharesight\n\nJoin thousands of investors
