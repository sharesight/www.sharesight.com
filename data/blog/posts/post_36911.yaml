:title: Where is the Uber of Australian wealth management?
:url_slug: where-is-the-uber-of-australian-wealth-management
:content: "Recently on the CuffeLinks blog, Graham Hand posted a [thoughtful piece](https://www.firstlinks.com.au/uber-amazon-wealth-management/)
  on what it might take to truly disrupt the Australian financial services industry.
  He asks whether or not there is an Uber or Amazon of wealth management.\n\nHand
  suggests that true disruption needs to be more than just online “robo-advice,” and
  rightly points out that even if these businesses attract billions, this would merely
  dent the $2 trillion superannuation market.\n\nUltimately, his take is that a true
  disruptor will need to upend all facets of wealth management (advice, admin, asset
  management) simultaneously and be price-led, a trusted brand, and non-reliant on
  the traditional distribution model. He concludes:\n\n> I don’t see how any company
  can make wealth management sufficiently exciting for enough people to grow a market
  share of 5 to 10% in the next few years. To use Google’s test, what problem will
  the disruptor solve in such a novel way that hundreds of billions will divert from
  incumbents? I hope I’m wrong because it would be fun to watch.<br><cite>Graham Hand,
  CuffeLinks</cite>\n\nI share in Hand’s hope for [one true disruptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker),
  and don’t see it on the horizon either. However, I do think disruption will happen,
  albeit differently.\n\nLet's remind ourselves that no one has managed to do this
  yet in the biggest, richest, and lowest-cost consumer market of them all: the United
  States. Over there, online trading is already dirt-cheap (free even!). Companies
  offering online advice are well-established (Wealthfront), with more on the way
  from big-time brands (Fidelity). \n\nSo why haven’t we seen a disruptor?\n\n**One,
  early adopters of tech-based solutions to old-school problems tend to be young people**
  , who tend to not have money, who tend to not contribute to their retirement (401k)
  accounts (it’s not compulsory). It’s difficult to convince even educated young professionals
  to invest. Unfortunately, most financial education in the US begins and ends with
  the human resources department of companies who offer retirement plans. As is with
  health care now in the US, you could argue that this shouldn’t be their responsibility
  at all.\n\n**Two, \"solutions\" are coming from the staid financial institutions
  that got us here in the first place.** They might succeed in convincing their existing
  client base to sign up to something online, but it's hard to see a 25 year-old downloading
  the Fidelity Investments app to their mobile. Plus, it's very difficult to \"start-up\"
  a bank, especially post-GFC. The capital requirements are massive. Tellingly, it's
  taken even Walmart with all their lobbying power, years to launch a [retail banking
  product](https://m.gobank.com/welcome/).\n\n**Three, taxes.** Not high taxes, but
  a perplexing tax code. The US tax system is in dire need of an overhaul. The less
  you know about it, the worse off you are, which disproportionally&nbsp;impacts those
  with less skin in the game. It's virtually impossible to file a tax return on your
  own. Working out state **and** federal taxes on even a simple ETF holding is complex
  (even for me and I’ve worked in this area for a decade).\n\n**Four, the actual process
  of moving money between accounts or from one institution to the next is excruciating.**
  Most payments are still made via physical cheque (which take 7 days to clear). The
  banks and the old-fashioned Automatic Clearing House (ACH) are to blame. If disruption
  has any chance at all, it must be easier for people to divert funds with one click.
  Even something as basic as NAB's [UBank](https://www.ubank.com.au) would be a game-changer
  in the US.\n\n![Uber of Wealth Management - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5Nr9GMO98cg20KkqQWiKAO/451cbdbfcfd2f7364a1423c965c43b42/featured_uber-of-wealth-management.png?w=950)\n\nMeanwhile,
  back home in Australia, items 1, 3, and 4 are already solved. Compulsory super means
  the piping is laid and everyone is contributing. The tax regime is far simpler,
  and moving money is a breeze. Superannuation is a model policy and no doubt improves
  the financial lives of millions. But it breeds a lethargic industry and middling
  returns for savers. With so much money automatically flowing into the very institutions
  likely to lose as a result of disruption, it’s hard to see them changing anything
  (hello number 2 above).\n\n**So disruption hasn't worked in the biggest market and
  it hasn't worked in one with the infrastructure already in place. But maybe comparing
  wealth management to Google, Amazon, and Uber isn't quite right.**\n\nThose tech
  giants succeed based on an our short-term needs. They're transactional and expertly
  deliver a means to an end. I want information, I search (free) on Google. I want
  to buy something I shop (free) at Amazon and know that I'll get the best price.
  I need to get from point A to B, I check to see where the Ubers are idling in real-time.\n\nConversely,
  wealth management is boring, long-term, and intangible. It's impossible for me to
  compare a bad experience with a good one, and even if I can do some comparative
  analysis it doesn't crystallise until years down the road. I know what not getting
  a taxi is like in Sydney on a Friday night, and I know how satisfying it is to call
  an Uber - problem solved.\n\nInstead, change might come incrementally, and disruption
  might just come from the many smaller companies taking on specific parts of the
  traditional vertically-aligned wealth management stack.\n\nToday, an investor using
  [Sharesight](/) can do SMSF admin using [ESUPER](/blog/announcing-new-sharesight-strategic-partner-esuperfund-ebroking/),
  get research from [Intelligent Investor](/blog/announcing-partnership-intelligent-investor/),
  do accounting with [Xero](/xero/), trading with [CMC](/blog/a-new-partnership-with-cmc-markets/),
  place a portion of their assets in a [Stockspot](/blog/announcing-new-strategic-partner-stockspot/)
  portfolio, and [share access](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/) with
  their financial adviser. And the critical factor here is that these solutions are
  investor-bought, and investor-driven. People are finding these solutions on their
  own and in turn demanding more from their advisers and accountants.\n\nThat's great
  news for investors already in the know, but to Hand's original point it's still
  difficult to see how the rest of the population gets sufficiently excited enough
  to revolutionise wealth management. Here's hoping more and more apps and services
  join the fight!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Blog -- [A broken chain of investment
