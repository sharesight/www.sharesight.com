:content: "With the support for [more than 170 global brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  and over 170,000 [stocks, ETFs and mutual/managed funds](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/),
  it’s now easier than ever to track your investments with Sharesight.\n\nInvestors
  trading with Australian broker [CommSec](https://www.commsec.com.au/) can automatically
  import historical and ongoing trades to their Sharesight portfolio, giving them
  access to Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n![image 0 CommSecSharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2JCVVabPIPgouw0YLT5d9g/53f0c270e5f1f0e0cd20cd6260f62dbe/image_0_CommSecSharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is Commsec?\n\nEstablished in 1995, Commonwealth Securities, or [CommSec](https://www.commsec.com.au/),
  is Australia’s largest online trading platform. Operated by Commonwealth Bank, CommSec
  offers brokerage fees from $10 per trade with access to a range of share markets
  supported by Sharesight, including the ASX, NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE and TYO. The platform
  also offers market news, research, instructional webinars and a range of other educational
  resources for investors. \n\n## Import your CommSec trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to easily import your trading history by either [connecting directly
  to your CommSec account](https://help.sharesight.com/commsec/) or uploading a [spreadsheet
  file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  of trades. You can also automatically import ongoing trades through the [Trade Confirmation
  Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) feature. Keep reading to learn
  more.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQavhEAAru0\" class=\"embedly-card\"

  Add historical trades through your CommSec account\n\nThe easiest way to build your
  Sharesight portfolio is to [directly import trades](https://help.sharesight.com/commsec/)
  from your CommSec account to Sharesight. This populates your Sharesight portfolio
  with historical buy and sell trades straight from your trading account. \n\n![image

  do this, you will need to enter your CommSec login details and choose the trading
  details you wish to import into Sharesight. \n\n**Note: Your CommSec login details
  will not be saved by Sharesight and your trading data is downloaded through a secure
  connection. Sharesight has no official relationship with CommSec and offers this
  service purely for your convenience.  If you do not wish to disclose your CommSec
  login details we recommend importing via spreadsheet file or Trade Confirmation
  Emails as outlined below.**\n\nOnce you have imported your historical trades into
  Sharesight, you can automatically import ongoing trades by using the Trade Confirmation
  Emails feature, as mentioned below. \n\n## How to import historical trades through
  a spreadsheet\n\nIf you prefer not to use your broker account login details to connect
  to Sharesight, another way to easily import historical trades to Sharesight is by
  uploading a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  of trades from your trading account. \n\n![image 2 CommSecSharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1ahHFS3DoewFIjO7xoZurd/169e27588b6bab8e3d034a257a75faec/image_2_CommSecSharesight.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio. \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n## Get started with Sharesight\n\nJoin thousands of
