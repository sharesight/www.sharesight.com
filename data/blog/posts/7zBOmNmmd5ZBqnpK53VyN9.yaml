:content: "2021 was a year filled with milestones for us here at Sharesight. We are
  proud to say that we reached over 300,000 global users in 2021, and continued to
  prioritise the expansion of our global user base by adding support for eight additional
  stock exchanges and over 50 brokers – meaning Sharesight users can now automatically
  import trades from [over 200 brokers worldwide](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/supported-brokers-global/).
  With user feedback in mind, we also launched the [Multi-Currency Valuation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/)
  and [Multi-Period](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/multi-period-report/) reports;
  plus re-launched the [Sharesight Community Forum](https://community.sharesight.com/).
  \n\nNot every new Sharesight feature gets its own blog post, but all updates are
  covered in our [monthly release notes](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/release-notes/).
