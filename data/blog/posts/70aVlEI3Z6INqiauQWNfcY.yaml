  Who is Raiz?\n\nEstablished in Australia in 2016, [Raiz Invest](https://raizinvest.com.au/)
  is a micro-investing app designed to help Australian and overseas investors grow
  wealth over time by allowing them to incrementally invest small amounts of money
  in ETFs. Raiz invests in ETFs on customers’ behalf using their remaining change
  from everyday purchases, or recurring or lump sum payments. Key features include
  the option to choose from six different portfolio types with varying risk levels
  and the ability to start investing with a minimum amount of $5. \n\n## Why you should
  track Raiz trades with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your Raiz trades to Sharesight,
  you can easily [track your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)

  help page](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) to get started, then forward

  Raiz. You only need to forward your **daily trade confirmations**. Should you forward
  a **monthly user statement** it will be marked as a ‘validation error’, however
