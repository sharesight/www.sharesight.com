:title: Thoughts on the Senate Inquiry
:url_slug: thoughts-senate-inquiry
:content: "Like many of you, we've been keeping an eye on the Senate Inquiry in Canberra
  into problems facing the financial planning arms of Macquarie, ANZ, NAB, and CBA.\n\nDepressing
  as the individual stories coming out of the hearings are, painting all banks and
  financial planners as evil is foolish and a bit lazy. On balance financial planning
  is a good thing. The industry puts Australian families' money to work in the markets
  and provides a secure retirement for millions. [Sharesight](/) services dozens of
  financial planning firms who've turned to products like ours because they value
  transparency and do the right thing by the client. Have a look in our [partner centre](/partners/)
  if you want to find a high quality planner. We have several in every major Australian
  city. **_However_**...\n\n![Australia Coat of Arms - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5L7KE7aTHU6EcCW2mmI0Gw/6c360a2ca2e8019e51e90206f7437b24/featured_au-coat-of-arms.jpg?w=950)\n\nThere
  are undeniably big problems in the industry. Fees have crept far too high (combination
  of commissions and investment fees), disclosure is inconsistent, and reporting requirements
  are paltry. Vertical integration makes sense if you're a bank, but even with the
  best intentions, putting client money into a bank-built product is at worst incentive
  laden and at best convenient (due to portfolio admin). Paradoxically, compulsory
  superannuation creates problems for ordinary savers. With all that guaranteed money
  coming in, advisers don't need to hustle for business.\n\nChanging an entire industry
  overnight and ferreting out all bad actors is impossible, but from our perspective,
  an area that can be easily improved is reporting.\n\nOne of the [questions](http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/the-five-questions-bank-chiefs-need-to-answer-at-senate-inquiry-20150420-1mpfv0)
  put to banks is whether or not they can identify bad apples before it's too late.
  One of the [banks](https://www.investordaily.com.au/regulation/37413-anz-wealth-boss-grilled-on-prime-access)
  even admitted that they didn't provide documented annual reviews.\n\nWe'd argue
  that a system like Sharesight would go a long way towards solving the current reporting
  deficiencies. Words like \"annual\" and \"report\" are archaic. Showing a client
  what happened to their portfolio last year is a waste of time. \n\n**Here's an idea
  for the Senate: mandate a live login to a portfolio. Australian banks' mobile apps
  are some of the best in the world. Why can't their financial planning apps be just
  as good?**\n\nWith Sharesight, investors can login and see exactly how their investments
  are going in real dollar terms. You don't need to be Warren Buffett to make sense
  of our interface.\n\nAnd from the top down, banks and financial planning groups
  could identify poorly performing advisers, portfolios, and even individual investments
  with the click of a mouse. Institutions and compliance teams could take a firm-wide
  view across all client portfolios to ensure they're within model portfolio rules.
  This is achievable today with our Dashboard feature and our API. \n\nIt's convenient
  to conjure up a scene of a smoke-filled board room filled with moustache-twisting
  fat cats, but the problems facing the financial planning industry today are as much
  the result of decades of bureaucratic inefficiency and sclerotic technology as they
  are reckless profiteering. Ironically, from an investing standpoint, this serves
  as a handy reminder that the big banks are insanely profitable and likely deserve
  a spot in our portfolios!\n\nAs we noted in [our response](/blog/where-is-the-uber-of-australian-wealth-management/)
  to Cuffelink's take on the future of wealth management, investor-led advocacy will
  come from a collection of purpose-built technology working in unison.\n\n### FURTHER
