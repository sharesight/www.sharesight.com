:title: A broken chain of investment providers

:content: "###### NOTE: This article originally appeared on [*Firstlinks*](https://www.firstlinks.com.au/tap-strengths-service-providers/).\n\nBuying
  food from a shop is so simple, it’s something many of us take for granted – but
  it doesn’t have to be.\n\nInstead of taking say, a carton of eggs to the checkout,
  imagine having to first ask the farmer if they’re free-range or caged, the grader
  for the size and quality, the Food Standards board for nutritional information,
  and (finally) the shop for the price.\n\nInvestors face a similar proposition every
  day.\n\nCrucial information such as [performance data](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  [tax reporting](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/), share dividends, corporate
  actions, and cost bases are spread across online brokers, share registrars, investment
  platforms, wraps and even old-fashioned spreadsheets.\n\n![featured - broken chain](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2OU9a60JAQ08GA2ysC2GGq/f659ace98aa428b1e6b44e11a57aaeb3/featured_broken-chain.png?w=950)\n\nBringing
  these pieces together leaves investors with a heavy administrative burden which
  can ultimately weigh down performance.\n\nIt is not a new problem. But many previous
  solutions have forced investors to pay excess fees for bundled, inflexible products
  or lumped them with simplistic performance methodologies which leave much to be
  desired.\n\nThe rise of low-cost, flexible fintech offers a new way forward. \n\nBut
  first, investors need to understand each provider’s strengths (and ultimately sidestep
  their weaknesses) if they are to solve this puzzle.\n\n## Missing pieces: a broken
  chain of service\n![table - investment providers](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4atUNipepy2gYMCcAIUUIQ/18a4488f9374e22bd25a4cbc741b61a0/table_investment-providers.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Online brokers: the transaction hub\n\nOnline brokers play a key role for investors:
  they represent a direct window into the world of listed securities. They democratised
  share trading in the 1990s by slashing trading costs and, over the years, have expanded
  their offering with greater volumes of research and trading ideas.\n\nToday, almost
  6 million Australians own direct shares according to the [ASX](https://www.asx.com.au/documents/resources/australian-share-ownership-study-2014.pdf)
  and 635,000 investors placed at least one share trade through an online broker in
  the 12 months to November 2015, according to Investment Trends.\n\nHowever, the
  online broker business model remains much the same: they make money when investors
  trade and maintain high cash balances. \n\nThis is a key reason driving the massive
  volumes of research and trading ideas they release and why they only offer minimal
  (if any) performance and tax reporting capabilities. One drives profits – the other
  drives costs.\n\nOnline brokers are a transaction hub rather than a performance
  and administrative hub. Typically, the profit/loss figures they provide fall down
  in two key areas: they don’t include dividends and they ignore how long investors
  have held their investment. \n\nThese [misleading performance](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  measures can be hundreds of percentage points away from common benchmarks used to
  compare a portfolio.\n\n## Share registrars: tracking what you own\n\nThe main function
  of a share registry, such as Link Group and Computershare, is to keep account of
  who owns what shares.\n\nThis is a crucial function but one that is performed on
  behalf of listed companies, which pay for the service. Share registrars provide
  a range of functions to companies such as paying out declared dividends, as well
  as administering employee share schemes and annual general meetings. \n\nThis naturally
  means a share registrar’s focus is on serving the needs of companies rather than
  the needs of share investors.\n\nInvestors can typically see the number of shares
  they hold (but not the original purchase price), dividends paid, and set up a dividend
  reinvestment plan. However, their investor-facing websites leave much to be desired
  and lack critical information such as true performance data and tax reporting.\n\n##
  Wraps and platforms: the advice portal\n\nWraps and platforms dominated the advice
  industry for many years. They offered a simple way for financial planners to sell
  a restricted range of managed funds while bundling in a range of fees such as platform,
  advice and volume rebates. \n\nMany of the funds management products on platforms
  were from related parties raising clear conflicts of interest: were they sold because
  they were the most suitable investment or because they raised profits for the parent
  company? \n\nPlatforms and wraps remain popular although, with much conflicted remuneration
  now banned, the industry is slowly moving away from product-led advice towards goals-based
  advice.\n\nWith less certainty about the strength of future investment returns,
  fees have also attracting more attention. Many investors have realised that percentage-based
  platform fees quickly outweigh any administrative and reporting benefits and have
  looked for cheaper solutions.\n\n## The rise of technology  \n\nEach provider in
  this investment chain has an important role to play but it is only now, with the
  rise of low-cost, cloud-based technology, that investors have an opportunity to
  use each to its full potential.\n\nInvestors intuitively recognise the need which
  is why so many fall back on the most basic technology of all: spreadsheets. \n\nThey
  spend substantial time manually updating trades, share prices, \ndividends, and
  costs from service providers (often including multiple online brokers and share
  registrars). They then attempt to calculate performance and tax data – a process
  prone to error.\n\nThere is no need although many investors remain trapped in the
  past. Identifying effective solutions remains a key challenge.\n\nNew service providers
  acting as a hub can now automatically receive useful data from each service provider,
  perform complex performance and tax calculations, and send it to others (such as
  accountants and advisers).\n\nThe most effective technology-based service providers
  also share a range of other attributes not commonly seen in the financial services
  industry.\n\nThey are highly flexible and easily accommodate investors’ widely varying
  assets and choice of service provider. They provide excellent value for money by
  charging a flat dollar amount rather than a percentage of funds.\n\nInvestors who
  can intelligently employ this type of fintech can build stronger portfolios by cutting
  their administrative burden and revealing a true picture of investment performance.\n\n###
