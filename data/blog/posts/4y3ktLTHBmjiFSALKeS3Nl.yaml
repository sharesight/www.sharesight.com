:title: 5 things you need to know before you set up an SMSF

  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIf you’re considering establishing
  a self-managed super fund (SMSF) to take more control over how your superannuation
  savings are invested for your retirement, you should know these 5 important things
  before diving in. \n\n![5 things you need to know before you set up an SMSF](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2KArddRdIBd4RCYX8KlIFA/cf5a020db535b24b47923a2b52fb8aa6/5_things_you_need_to_know_before_you_set_up_an_SMSF.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Firstly, what is an SMSF?\n\nToday the [Australian superannuation regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia)
  is a compulsory system set up for the benefit of employees which can only be accessed
  in retirement. The compulsory aspect was introduced in 1991, coming into full effect
  in 1992, including legislation known as the Superannuation Guarantee. This enforced
  compulsory contributions, currently a minimum contribution of 9.5% of an employee's
  income, which is paid into your choice of super fund. \n\nThese funds can be separated
  into two main segments, traditional and [Self Managed Superannuation Funds (or SMSFs)](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/).
  There is no single best type of fund as each appeal to different investors for their
  specific advantages and features. Generally, traditional funds are much easier to
  manage and require much less time, but often lack the flexibility and complete control
  that SMSFs provide. \n\nSMSF is [set up by members who also act as the trustees](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/setting-up/choose-individual-trustees-or-a-corporate-trustee/).
  The trustees run the fund with the sole purpose to benefit themselves, managing
  all aspects of the fund's operations from its investment strategy to administration,
  tax and legal requirements. A summary of the [main difference between SMSFs and
  traditional funds](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Thinking-about-self-managed-super/Compare-SMSFs-with-other-super-funds/)
  are outlined below:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>SMSFs</td>\n    <td>Traditional
  Funds</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Control over investment strategy & selection</td>\n
  \   <td>Full control</td>\n    <td>Limited control</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Control
  of when to buy & sell investments</td>\n    <td>Full control</td>\n    <td>Limited
  control</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Responsibility for compliance</td>\n    <td>You
  (or your trustee) is personally responsible</td>\n    <td>Superfund trustee is responsible</td>\n
  \ </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Regulators</td>\n    <td>ATO</td>\n    <td>Australian Prudential
  Regulation Authority (APRA)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Time requirements</td>\n
  \   <td>Very time consuming</td>\n    <td>Not time consuming</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n
  \   <td>Management and administration costs</td>\n    <td>Flat fees for platforms
  like Sharesight\nPercentage fees on investment wraps/platforms</td>\n    <td>Usually
  a percentage of total funds under management\nDue to scale, cost of administration
  typically lower per member</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nA more detailed comparison
  can be found on the [ATO’s website](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Thinking-about-self-managed-super/Compare-SMSFs-with-other-super-funds/)
  or visit the  ASIC’s Money Smart website for a brief overview of each of the [types
  of super funds](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement/how-super-works/choosing-a-super-fund/types-of-super-funds).
  \n\nSMSFs account for approximately one quarter (28%) of all super assets (however,
  only contain 3.8% of super fund members), and as of March 2019 alone totalled approximately
  $750 billion in assets. SMSF’s have quickly grown in popularity, having a 5% growth
  rate per year for the past five years,  consisting  of over 591,000 funds with a
  total of 1.1 million members. \n\nWith the basics of SMSFs out of the way, here's
  5 things you'll need to know before you choose to set one up.\n\n## SMSF professional
  advice comes in many forms\n\nThere are several [types of professional advisors
  for SMSFs](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement/self-managed-super-fund-smsf#advisers)
  who may be of benefit, in both the establishment and ongoing management of your
  SMSF.\n\nDuring establishment, the main advisors to SMSFs are:\n\n-       A financial
  advisor for the preparation of investment strategies, advice on different investment
  products and insurance products.\n\n-       An accountant to set up financial systems
  and to prepare the SMSFs accounts and operating statements.\n\n-       A fund administrator
  for establishment and ongoing operations of your SMSF to meet reporting and administrative
  obligations.\n\n-       A legal partitioner when preparing or updating your fund’s
  trust deed.\n\n \n\nPost-establishment\n\n-       An [approved SMSF auditor](https://asic.gov.au/for-finance-professionals/self-managed-superannuation-fund-smsf-auditors/)
  to audit the fund.\n\n-       A tax agent to help complete and lodge annual return
  and provide taxation advice.\n\n \n\n## SMSFs can have either Individual Trustees
  or Corporate Trustees\n\nWhen establishing your SMSF, you can [choose either an
  individual or corporate trust structure](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/setting-up/choose-individual-trustees-or-a-corporate-trustee/#Memberandtrusteerequirements).
  Both allow up to four trustees, each having advantages and disadvantages, the main
  differences being:\n\n-       Member and trustee requirements\n\n-       Costs\n\n-
  \      Ownership of fund assets\n\n-       Separation of assets\n\n-       Penalties\n\n-
  \      Succession\n\n \n\nDuring an SMSFs establishment, trustees (individual trust)
  or directors (corporate trust) must be appointed  under the fund’s trust deed. These
  appointed trustees or directors are equally responsible for the day-to-day operations,
  management and decisions of the SMSF. Other professionals can also be selected to
  help with the management of the SMSF, such as an accountant, financial planner or
  tax agent. However, the ultimate responsibility and accountability of the SMSF’s
  actions solely lies with the trustees and directors.\n\n \n\n## The SMSF trust &
  trust deed are key \n\nTo establish an SMSF, a trust is set up to hold assets for
  the sole benefit of the beneficiaries for retirement. A superfund is a [unique type
  of trust](https://www.biscosgrove.com.au/general/difference-self-managed-super-funds-regular-trusts/),
  enabling its trustees to personally manage their funds contained within the trust,
  unlike a regular trust structure where money must be managed by someone other than
  the trustee. \n\nA [SMSF trust must](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Setting-up/Create-the-trust-and-trust-deed/):
  \n\n-       Have at least one trustee or director\n\n-       Adheir with its governing
  rules (trust deed)\n\n-       Hold at least one asset or investment\n\n-       Contain
  legally identifiable beneficiaries\n\n \n\nA [trust deed is a legal document](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Setting-up/Create-the-trust-and-trust-deed/)
  outlining the governing rules for the establishment and operation of an SMSF. A
  trust deed typically includes:\n\n-       The fund’s objectives\n\n-       List
  of all members and trustees\n\n-       How trustees or directors be appointed or
  removed\n\n-       Outlines when contributions can be made\n\n-       States whether
  benefits can be paid as lump sums or income streams\n\n-       When and how professional
  advisors can be appointed\n\n-       The ‘winding up’ procedure\n\nTherefore it
  is vital that SMSF trustees fully consider all decisions and subsequent implications
  when creating both a SMSF trust and trust deed and how it will impact the ongoing
  operations of the fund. \n\n\n## SMSFs need to be registered with the ATO\n\nTo
  fully comply with ATO regulations and be eligible to [receive tax concession](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/glossary/c/concessional-super-contributions)[s](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/glossary/c/concessional-super-contributions),
  an SMSF needs to be registered as an Australian super fund at all times throughout
  the financial year. If an SMSF stops being an Australian super fund and does not
  meet all [residency conditions ](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Setting-up/Check-your-fund-is-an-Australian-super-fund/#Fundresidencyconditions),
  it will become non-compliant, and as a result, its income will be [taxed at the
  highest marginal tax rate](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Investing/Tax-on-income/Assessable-contributions/).\n\n
  \n\nTo be classified as an [Australian super fund](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Setting-up/Check-your-fund-is-an-Australian-super-fund/),
  the SMSF must comply with the following residency rules:\n\n1. Be established in
  Australia, or hold at least one investment located within Australia.\n\n2. The central
  management and control of the fund [ordinarily resides in Australia](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Setting-up/Check-your-fund-is-an-Australian-super-fund/#Whattodoifmembersgooverseas).\n\n3.
  Have either no active members or contain active trustees who are Australian residents
  and hold at least 50% of the total amount payable to active members if they decide
  to leave the fund.\n\n \n\n## SMSFs need an ABN, bank account & electronic service
  address\n\nSMSFs can’t be run using personal bank accounts or credit cards. Instead,
  trustees need to establish the following in the name of your SMSF in order to administer
  the fund:\n\n### ABN\n\nOnce your SMSF has been established with all trustees/directors
  appointed, the ATO allows a maximum of 60 days to officially register your SMSF.
  [Registering is completed by applying for an Australian Business Number (ABN) through
  the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/setting-up/register-your-fund/).\n\n###
  Bank account\n\nA [bank account in the SMSF’s name](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/setting-up/set-up-a-bank-account/)
  is required to accept contributions, rollovers of super and where income from investments
  will be paid. This account is also used to pay the fund’s expenses and liabilities.
  However, the fund's bank account must be kept separate to each of the individual
  trustees’ accounts or any related personal accounts.\n \n\nFor funds with two to
  four members, a single account is still able to be used, however a separate record
  of their entitlement is required, which is called a ‘member account’. The account
  will show:\n\n-       The contributions made by each member\n\n-       Fund investment
  earning allocations\n\n-       Individual member payments of super benefits\n\n
  \n\n### Electronic service address\n\n[Creating an electronic service address](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Setting-up/Get-an-electronic-service-address/)
  requires both the SMSF’s ABN and bank account details to be created beforehand.
  This address allows your SMSF to receive contributions from employers via SuperStream
  electronically. SuperStream data is the way businesses can make employee super contributions
  , where the money and data are sent electronically in a standardised  form.\n\n
  \n\n## SMSFs need an exit strategy\n\nWhen establishing an SMSF trustee need to
  [consider what happens to the fund when it ends or ‘winds up’](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Setting-up/Prepare-an-exit-strategy/).
  This is an essential step due to unanticipated events arising that may make your
  SMSF unmanageable. The three most common reasons to wind up are:\n\n-       A relationship
  breakdown\n\n-       An illness or accident that leaves a trustee incapacitated\n\n-
  \      The death of a trustee \n \n\nIn the event of such circumstances, having
  an exit strategy may reduce the impact of these unexpected events. The main things
  to consider when creating an exit strategy are:\n\n-       Ensuring that all trustees
  have access to SMSF records and electronic accounts.\n\n-       Including specific
  rules in the trust’s fund deed which are  triggered by events, such as the ones
  listed above, that may lead to the fund becoming unmanageable. \n\n-       Having
  all members make binding death benefit nominations\n\n-     Appointing an enduring
  power of attorney for each member\n\n-       Including the likely costs involved
  with winding up an SMSF\n\n## Manage your SMSF with Sharesight\n\nSharesight is
