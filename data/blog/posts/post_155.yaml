  In the latest [Sharesight](/) update we have put some finishing touches on the [Sold Shares Report](https://help.sharesight.com/sold_shares/) which includes links back to the Share Details page for each share on the report. This is really handy if you need to edit historic dividend or trade details for a share that you have sold out of.

  The sold shares report shows capital, dividend, and currency gains associated with shares that have been sold and are therefore not reported under your current holdings. As with the main portfolio page, the return figures in the report may be displayed in dollars or as annualised percentages.

  Other recent changes include the addition of a quantity column on the main portfolio page to show the total quantity of shares owned for each holding (by popular demand!). Thanks to everyone who has provided feedback, and please keep it coming!
