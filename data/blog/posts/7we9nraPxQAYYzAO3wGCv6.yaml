:title: Easily import ASB Securities trades into Sharesight
:url_slug: easily-import-asb-securities-trades-into-sharesight
:content: "Did you know that you can automatically import trades from over [170 brokers
  around the world](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/) into your [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/)
  portfolio? In 2012 we developed a solution that allows you to automatically record
  your buy and sell trades via the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  emailed to you when you trade with some brokers.\n\nInvestors can now import trades
  automatically to their Sharesight portfolio for New Zealand broker [ASB Securities](https://www.asb.co.nz/asb-securities).
  This makes it easier than ever for New Zealand investors to leverage Sharesight’s
  award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/),
  and tax reporting features.\n\n![ASB Securities Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Y4UiEVl5lGlcKpkS2iKiO/8ae2996241c79b75a1e7b5fcb8ec450a/ASB_Securities_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is ASB Securities?\n\nOperating under one of New Zealand’s most well-known banks,[
  ASB Securities](https://www.asb.co.nz/asb-securities) is a full-service broker that
  offers DIY online trading on the NZX and ASX, and access to major global markets
  through its network of brokers. Brokerage fees start from $15 per trade and investors
  have access to shares, ETFs, New Zealand fixed interest securities, IPOs and margin
  lending. ASB also provides regular market reports, analyst information and company
  news to keep investors up-to-date. \n\n## Import your ASB Securities trades to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to import your trading history by directly connecting your ASB Securities
  account to Sharesight. Alternatively, you can manually import your history by uploading
  a CSV file, and automatically link ongoing trades through the Trade Confirmation
  Emails feature. Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## Connect directly to your ASB securities
  account\n\nThe easiest way to build your Sharesight portfolio is to [connect to
  your ASB Securities trading account](https://help.sharesight.com/asb-securities/)
  with Sharesight. This imports your historical buy and sell trades directly from
  your trading account into Sharesight. \n\n![ASB Securities Sharesight Import](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/55kGmqUixmR5zJvgQprFjP/864bfe483f1315b2e841e362de17a5e2/ASB_Securities_Sharesight_Import.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  do this, you will need to enter your ASB Securities login details and choose the
  trading details you wish to import into Sharesight. \n\n*__Note:__ Your ASB Securities
  login details will not be saved by Sharesight and your trading data is downloaded
  through a secure connection. Sharesight has no official relationship with ASB securities
  and offers this service purely for your convenience.  If you do not wish to disclose
  your ASB Securities login details we recommend importing via CSV file or Trade Confirmation
  Emails as outlined below.*\n\nOnce you have imported your historic trades into Sharesight,
  you can automatically import ongoing trades by using the Trade Confirmation Emails
  feature, as mentioned below. \n\n## How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet
  \n\nIf you prefer not to use your broker account login details to connect to Sharesight,
  another way to easily import historical trades to Sharesight is by creating a [spreadsheet](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1)
  of your trades from your trading account.\n\n![Sharesight CSV Import Screen](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3rXn8QHaMZGbxlG1yUHVDO/5e91ca5a68ee6e3f05096e472bf8119b/Sharesight_CSV_Import_Screen.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio. \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n## We need your help to add more brokers!\n\nIf your
  broker is not yet on [Sharesight’s list of supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  but they send you trade confirmation emails (or you’re able to download the PDF
  trade confirmations, or a spreadsheet of trades from your broker manually), then
  ask us to support your broker by leaving us a message in the chat interface located
  at the bottom-right of Sharesight.\n\nWe just need a handful of sample trade confirmation
  emails in order to support a new broker, so reach-out today if you’d like to see
  yours added!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n* [How Sharesight calculates your investment
