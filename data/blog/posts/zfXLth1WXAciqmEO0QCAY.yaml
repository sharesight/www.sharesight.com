:title: Introducing the Sharesight Partner Centre
:content: |-
  Today I’m pleased to introduce the [Sharesight Partner Centre](/partners/):

  [![featured - Sharesight Partner Centre](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1D1dDdQMOYi66U082OSSYU/e95709f462211deb79ca004d08a0bc69/featured_sharesight-partner-centre.jpg?w=950)](/partners/)

  For the past 10 years, we’ve been committed to making [Sharesight](/) the best portfolio tracker for DIY investors and the finance professionals who serve them. From very early on, we knew that [working with like-minded partners](/blog/why-the-right-partners-matter/) was the key to our success and growth.

  It’s why we partnered with tech-driven companies such as [Xero](/xero/) and [CMC Markets Stockbroking](/partners/cmc/) early-on. It’s also why we’re [founding members of FinTech Australia](/blog/sharesight-founding-member-of-fintech-australia/), and proud to be represented on their [ecosystem map](/blog/where-sharesight-fits-in-fintech-australias-ecosystem-map/). In fact, they recognised the strength of our own ecosystem when they named Sharesight the [“Finnies” award winner for Excellence in Industry Collaboration and Partnerships (Australia)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-wins-2017-finnies-award-for-excellence-in-industry-collaboration-partnerships/) earlier this year.

  **Our long-term vision for Sharesight is that it becomes an investor’s passport. Where you journey is up to you -- and it’s the Partner Centre that acts as your investment marketplace.**

  ## How to use the Sharesight Partner Centre

  Visit the Partner Centre to [see all 56 Sharesight partners](/partners/all/), or drill-down to view a specific industry:

  - [Accountants](/partners/accountants/)
  - [Accounting Software](/partners/accounting-software/)
  - [Asset Managers & Robo-Advisors](/partners/asset-managers-and-robo-advisors/)
  - [Associations](/partners/associations/)
  - [Brokers](/partners/brokers/)
  - [Data Providers](/partners/data-providers/)
  - [Financial Advisors](/partners/financial-advisors/)
  - [Research Providers](/partners/research-providers/)
  - [Other](/partners/other/)

  Clicking on a company takes you to their individual partner page, which describes the company and how they work with Sharesight -- including whether they use the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) to push data into Sharesight (like [CMC Markets Stockbroking](/partners/cmc/)), or to pull data out of Sharesight in order to provide award-winning performance reporting to their clients (like [Macrovue](/partners/macrovue/) and [Six Park](/partners/six-park/)).

  <small>Just a few of our co-branded Broker API partners</small>

  ## What’s next?

  The Partner Centre will be ever growing and changing, but here are the things we’ll be working on next:

  - If you’re a Sharesight-enabled accounting or financial advice firm and your logo is missing, fear not! We’ll be reaching-out in the coming weeks with details on how to have your company included.

  - We’ll also be adding a search feature that will allow investors to find Sharesight-enabled accountants and financial advisors in their area.

  We’re always looking for great companies to join our growing ecosystem:

  - Accountants, financial advisors and fund managers: become a [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) partner.
