:content: "At Sharesight, we believe the security of your investment data is important.
  To help you protect your account, Sharesight supports an additional layer of security
  called two-factor authentication (2FA). The following article provides some information
  on 2FA and how to leverage it when logging into Sharesight. \n\n![Sharesight two-factor
  authentication (2FA)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2DPL6y3ftEdEBL1W7z0qRq/c7ad6dee6dafe41ea6c7e1dfd302a24a/Sharesight_two-factor_authentication__2FA_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?\n\nTwo-factor authentication, also known
  as 2FA, is an extra layer of security that requires not only a password and username
  but also a unique token that verifies you as the account owner. Often, this unique
  token is a code that is sent to your phone via a text, voice call, or mobile app.\n\n##
  How Sharesight’s 2FA solution works\n\nSharesight’s 2FA solution requires an Authentication
  app installed on your mobile phone, we recommend using either Google Authenticator,
  [Duo Mobile](https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/duo-mobile-app),
  [Authy or Windows phone Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator),
  \ but other apps may also work.\n\nOnce enabled, you will be required to enter your
  Authentication Code *in addition to* the account password when logging in to Sharesight.
  If the device with the Authentication app is ever lost, you will need to use one
  of the backup codes provided during the 2FA setup process (important to save these
  somewhere safe) **else you will lose access to the account**. \n\n## How to enable
  2FA on your Sharesight account\n\nThe process to enable 2FA on your Sharesight account
  will be familiar for anyone who has used 2FA mobile apps before, and involves the
  following steps: \n\n1. If you’re not using Sharesight yet, [sign up for a FREE
  account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup) to get started\n\n2. If you don’t
  already have an Authenticator app on your mobile, install one from the list above
  \n\n3. Navigate to the Account Settings > My Details page and select ‘Enable Two-Factor
  Authentication’ \n\n4. Scan the QR code that appears with the Authenticator app\n\n5.
  Verify the Authentication Code the app displays by entering it into the field provided\n\n6.
  Save or print a copy of the backup codes in a safe place (**this is important**)\n\nWhen
  you next login to your Sharesight account, you will be prompted to enter this 2FA
  Authentication Code when logging in. \n\nFor more information, read our help page
  on [enabling 2FA on your Sharesight account](https://help.sharesight.com/two-factor-authentication/).
