:title: How using Super to buy a house robs your future self
:content: "Politicians are incentivised by winning elections, which can lead to bad
  policy based on short-term incentives.\n\nThose in Canberra don’t tackle the hard
  stuff because it costs them votes in key demographics. This isn’t an Australian-specific
  problem. The US Congress is on the verge of another shutdown and can’t even agree
  on [how to name new post offices](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/maya-angelou-post-office-republicans_us_56d6aeb7e4b0871f60ed3cfc).\n\nZoom
  out wide enough, and you’ll realise most major legislation to actually improve people's
  lives was passed shortly after World War II when the world was on the brink and
  people just wanted normalcy.\n\n**The proposal to let young Australians divert money
  from superannuation to their first home purchase is a terrible idea that reeks of
  short-term thinking.**\n\nThis guarantees younger Australians will be poorer in
  the future and will further increase house prices. The politicians responsible float
  band-aid policy like this because voters struggle to grasp long-term financial concepts.
  Those same politicians will be long-gone by the time this becomes a reelection issue.\n\n![featured

  a simple example. Take Malcolm, a young lawyer making $100,000 per year. He wants
  to buy a house, but is struggling to find something affordable. Under the proposed
  policy, Malcolm diverts money towards a “home savings account” for three years.\n\nMalcolm’s
  balance after three years is $58,710 assuming a 1.5% yield, the current 9.5% super
  contribution rate, and the post-tax dollar matching the government will mandate.\n\nMalcolm
  thinks, “Wow! Nice chunk of cash,” which is correct, but uninformed. Malcolm’s hard
  earned money generated just $1,710 - a return of 1.48% using Sharesight’s money-weighted
  annualisation methodology. That’s less than a week’s pay on his salary.\n\nIf Malcolm
  had invested in an ETF tracking the US stock market (VTS) - a more diversified option
  than investing solely in Australia - his $57,000 contribution would have done far
  better over the three year savings period.\n\n|      | Return %     | Capital Gain
  $     | Income Gain $     |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------
  |\n| Home Savings Account       | 1.48%       | $0       | $1,710       |\n| Vanguard
  US Total Market (VTS) | 16.38%  | $16,318  | $4,378       |\n\n<small>Return % is
  annualised.</small>\n\nA look at the value of each investment over time shows the
  widening disparity between the US equity ETF and cash. Remember, this is only the
  three year savings window!\n\n![screenshot - Super vs. Housing](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5rk4lSfPtmySKWqWickKg8/ede4f31c3a402c89f818aa657c268ff7/screenshot_super-vs-housing.png?w=950)\n\nThat
  $20,000 Malcolm's ETF generated in this short-term window will roll into the future
  generating compound returns - the best way to grow a portfolio over time.\n\n**An
  investor must think about time horizon, expected return, and risk when making a
  decision.**\n\nMalcolm’s ETF could have lost value during his three year saving
  period.\n\nHowever, Malcolm’s ultimate intention - and what the proposed policy
  will force him to do at the end of the savings period - is to buy a house. This
  extends the time horizon of this investment, but it forcibly reallocates his portfolio
  from cash to property.\n\nBlistering house prices are dominating the headlines and
  Malcolm, left out of BBQ talk, wants in on the action.\n\nAccording to the ABS the
  weighted national house price average [increased 7.7% in 2016](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6416.0).
  \n\nBut here’s the truth nobody talks about - in order for a house to double in
  value over 10 years, it needs to average a 7% return **every** year. A 7% return
  on a stock portfolio would be a passing grade for most investors, but nobody would
  call it blistering.\n\nMost economists expect house prices to grow “in the single
  digits.” The historical annualised growth figure from 2002 to 2016 is [less than
  2% nationally](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/housing-index). Don’t forget
  [Cate Blanchett’s property investment experience](/blog/cate-blanchett-queen-of-100-investment-returns/).\n\nAdditionally,
  Malcolm will be taking out a mortgage (which has fees) in an environment where the
  borrowing rate is as low as it’s ever been in Western democratic history. His mortgage
  will get more expensive as rates rise. And he’ll need to sink time and money into
  maintaining his house too.\n\n**A house can generate middling returns, which is
  fine, as long as you’re not solely counting on it to retire.**\n\nIn theory a house
  gives you a place to live (economic utility) and ought to give you some kind of
  capital return to supplement your next life stage, alongside superannuation, and
  other savings.\n\nIn reality, the government is telling Australians to rush into
  a market at its peak, and to concentrate their savings in an asset that won’t lose
  value.\n\nThis might be true ***if*** your house appreciates by at least 7% every
  year, ***if*** rising interest rates allow you to keep up with your mortgage repayments,
  ***if*** negative gearing and capital gains tax rates remain favourable, and ***if***
  you can find a buyer when you need to sell.\n\nTaking money away from super decades
  before it has a chance to compound rips a hole in your savings and means your house
  will need to do more than double each decade.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Blog --
