:title: What are short-term vs long-term capital gains?
:url_slug: what-are-short-term-vs-long-term-capital-gains
:content: "When looking to earn returns, many people turn to investments, only to
  realise that if they’re not careful, their profits can be eaten up by capital gains
  tax (CGT). In particular, Australians are subject to short-term capital gains and
  long-term capital gains, which are both taxed at different rates. In this blog post,
  we will focus on Australian CGT, explaining the difference between short-term and
  long-term capital gains, along with strategies to minimise CGT, and how investors
  can use Sharesight to calculate their CGT.\n\n![What are short-term and long-term
  capital gains](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7N2B2JDneCYjRudRGOLXA6/161c3c513f1117fca79a6d2a89d6933f/What_are_short-term_and_long-term_capital_gains_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What are capital gains? \n\nCapital gains occur when you make a profit on an asset
  you’ve sold, which could be anything from stocks and cryptocurrency to real estate
  and jewellery. The sale of an asset is known as a capital gains tax event. There
  are other capital gains tax events, such as the loss or destruction of an asset,
  but in this article we’ll focus purely on selling. \n\nThere are two types of capital
  gains generated by capital gains tax events: short-term capital gains and long-term
  capital gains. Both are taxed at different rates, depending on how long you held
  the asset before selling it. \n\n## What are short-term capital gains? \n\nShort-term
  capital gains can be made on any assets you acquire and sell within twelve months.
  This includes things like real estate, stocks, cryptocurrency leases, licenses,
  foreign currency, and collector’s items such as jewellery.\n\n## What are long-term
  capital gains? \n\nLong-term capital gains are any assets you’ve made a profit on
  which you owned for more than a year before selling. Again, this can be anything
  from real estate to gold – or any investment which isn’t your main residence, vehicle,
  or a depreciating asset such as business equipment.\n\n## How are long-term and
  short-term capital gains taxed differently?\n\nLong and short-term capital gains
  are taxed differently. To calculate the amount of capital gains tax you will need
  to pay, you need to know the following details of the asset sale:\n\n1. How much
  the asset cost.\n\n2. Whether you owned the asset for more or less than one year.\n\n3.
  The price you sold your asset for.\n\n4. What your current taxable income is (capital
  gains tax is [added to your current taxable income](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/australia/individual/income-determination)
  and may push you into a higher bracket).\n\n5. How much you invested into your asset
  before you sold it. For example, if you sold an investment property, you will need
  to know the amount spent on renovations, real estate agents, landscaping, and so
  on, as this will be used to calculate your capital gains tax. \n\nIf you have made
  a short-term capital gain, you will be required to pay tax on the full amount of
  the profit you made. The profit is the difference between your initial investment
  and how much you sold the asset for. These earnings will be taxed at your personal
  income tax rate. \n\nIf however, you held the asset for over a year before selling
  and made a long-term capital gain, then you only pay capital gains tax on [50% of
  the capital gain](https://www.nab.com.au/personal/life-moments/manage-money/money-basics/capital-gains-tax)
  at the standard income tax rates. This means half your earnings on that asset are
  tax-free.\n\n## What are the exceptions to the capital gains tax rate for long-term
  gains?\n\nWhile the profit you make on any investment will be taxed at your personal
  income tax rate, [some items are exempt](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/CGT-assets-and-exemptions/#Exemptions1)
  from capital gains tax. These include:\n\n* Your primary residence (although investment
  properties are subject to the tax).\n\n* Your personal, daily use vehicle.\n\n*
  Assets acquired before 20 September 1985.\n\n* Collectibles purchased for $500 or
  less, or collectibles that were worth $500 or less when acquired (even if you paid
  more at the time).\n\n* Depreciating assets used solely for taxable purposes (i.e.
  anything that declines in value over its lifetime such as computers, tools, and
  furniture).\n\n* Wins made when gambling or in competitions. \n\n## How can you
  minimise capital gains taxes?\n\nThere are a variety of ways to [minimise your capital
  gains tax](https://www.wilsonpateras.com.au/how-to-minimise-capital-gains-tax-cgt/),
  including:\n\n### Keeping an asset for more than a year\n\nIf you hold an asset
  for over twelve months, this will reduce the capital gains tax you need to pay.
  This only applies to individuals – companies must still pay full tax on a long-term
  capital gain. \n\n### Offset your capital gain with a capital loss\n\nA capital
  loss can be offset against any capital gains made in the current financial year,
  or it can be carried forward to offset capital gains you may make in the future.
  Capital losses, however, cannot be used to offset income.\n\n### Have residential
  properties revalued before placing them on the rental market\n\nHaving your property
  revalued before renting it out means you will only be liable for the capital gains
  you make on top of the new valuation, not the profit made on top of the property’s
  initial value when you bought it. \n\n### Small businesses offer capital gains tax
  concessions\n\nAssets belonging to small businesses are often eligible for certain
  concessions when sold.\n\n### Include the costs of acquisition and disposal when
  calculating capital gains tax\n\nIf you reduce your cost base, you reduce your capital
  gain by including the costs associated with purchasing and selling the asset.  Capital
  gains tax on a property, for example, can be reduced by offsetting agent fees, rates,
  repairs and insurance costs.\n\n### Do you have to pay capital gains if you reinvest?\n\nUnfortunately,
  you still need to pay capital gains tax even if you reinvest the profits you made
  on your investment. There are, however, ways to [avoid paying capital gains tax](https://www.bhg.com.au/avoiding-capital-gains-tax)
  on certain assets like houses. For example, if you live in a property immediately
  after acquiring it, you may be exempt from capital gains tax. You may also be exempt
  if you purchased your property as a member of a self-managed super fund, and bought
  your house with a separate SMSF property home loan.\n\n### How do I keep track of
  my capital gains and losses?\n\nSharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
