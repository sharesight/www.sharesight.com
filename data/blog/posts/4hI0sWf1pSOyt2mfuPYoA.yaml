:content: "With Sharesight, investors can easily see how much money they have made
  selling stocks, ETFs and funds by running the [Sold Securities Report](https://help.sharesight.com/sold_shares/).
  The report gives investors a breakdown of their realised gains on investments they
  have sold, calculated using the average cost base of those holdings in their portfolio
  – making it a useful tool for investors to evaluate their performance. To learn
  more about how investors can benefit from using the Sold Securities Report, keep
  reading. \n\n![Sold Securities Report Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2TIhEj0aOSaYMCOboDK6Om/2d57888630761463c42c18bca530885f/Sold_Securities_Report_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  See all of your realised gains in one place \n\nIf you’ve sold out of positions
  in your portfolio, it’s important to know what these holdings are and how much you
  actually profited (aka. your realised gains). Unlike some brokers which only show
  you investments you’ve sold out of in the past 12 months, Sharesight’s [Sold Securities
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/sold_shares/) allows you to see the full picture
  of your performance by viewing the total return of all the investments you have
  sold over any date range, broken down by capital gains, dividends and currency gains.
  \n\nWhile it is possible to toggle on sold positions on your Portfolio Overview
  page, the Sold Securities Report is ideal for investors who want to see all of these
  trades in one place, independent from their open positions (current holdings). The
  report can also be customised to your needs, with the ability to organise your sold
  positions by market, currency, sector, industry, investment type or a [custom grouping](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  of your choice. This makes it a useful tool to assess your decision to sell out
  of certain positions in your portfolio, and evaluate your investing strategy over
  the long-term. \n\n![Sold Securities Report US portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5KFu2jSJfMPBftGVEDE9Ed/6b44bde1300b6dfcb5a4b783fca48182/Sold_Securities_Report_US_portfolio.JPG)\n<small>

  with investments in Asian and US markets. </small>\n\n## Calculate your capital
  gains tax (CGT)\n\nIf you calculate capital gains using the average cost method,
  you may be able to use the [Sold Securities Report](https://help.sharesight.com/sold_shares/)
  to get an indication of your capital gains. Because the report subtracts the cost
  basis of your investments from your realised gains, it is able to automatically
  produce a capital gains figure, which can be shared with your accountant to determine
  your capital gains tax. However, depending on your tax residency and the complexity
  of your investments, this capital gains figure may need to be adjusted to reflect
  certain CGT events in your portfolio. Please refer to your accountant for further
  details.\n\n**Note:** Sharesight has a Capital Gains Tax Report designed for the
  needs of [Australian](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  and [Canadian](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/)
  investors. \n\n### Share the report with your accountant\n\nSharing the report with
  your accountant is made easy with the ability to export the report to different
  file formats including an Excel spreadsheet, PDF or Google Sheet. This will help
  you (and your accountant) save time on data entry and tedious manual calculations.\n\n##
