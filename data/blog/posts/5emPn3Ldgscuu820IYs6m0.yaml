:title: ETF growth in investment portfolios

:content: "The majority of [Sharesight](/) users are seasoned DIY investors who tend
  to be ahead of the curve when it comes to new investment trends. By observing changes
  across the pool of Sharesight portfolios we can generate valuable insights as a
  leading indicator of new investor trends. The rise of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
  as an investment option to gain broad exposure to an index and increase portfolio
  diversification is just one such trend.\n\n## The rise in ETFs since 2007\n\nSharesight
  allows users to track a wide variety of investment types, including shares, ETFs,
  [managed funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/managed-funds-live-on-sharesight/),
  [foreign exchange (FX) holdings](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-foreign-currency-on-sharesight/)
  and [cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  to name just a few.  When breaking down these different investment types since 2007
  we find the emergence of ETFs striking. Direct share investments continue to form
  the backbone of Sharesight investor portfolios, but while they made up 90% of portfolio
  holdings in 2007, they had fallen to only 80% by the end of 2017.\n\n![Growth in

  reason for this change? Investors have shifted a material slice of their investment
  portfolios to ETFs - with the percentage of ETFs within Sharesight portfolios moving
  from <1% in 2007 to almost 7% within only 10 years. Alongside that, we have also
  observed a small shift away from investments in Managed Trusts, falling from 6%
  of to only 4% of portfolio value over the same period.\n\n![direct share investment

  What explains the rise in popularity of ETFs?\n\nThe obvious question would be,
  why the move towards ETFs? Broadly ETFs help investors to:\n\n- __Use the wisdom
  of the crowd:__ Researching and Investing in individual shares will depend on how
  actively you invest. With ETFs, you don’t need to research the individual shares
  as a ready made basket of shares is available which qualify according to a particular
  theme or index \n- __Invest in international markets:__ If you are looking to invest
  in international markets, ETFs are a good vehicle to gain international exposure
  without needing to trade directly on international exchanges\n- __Diversify your
  portfolio:__ Spreading the investment over a range of Industries and sectors averages
  our the portfolio performance and helps to reduce the risk in case a sector or industry
  underperforms\n- __Do the above (relatively) cheaply:__ Compared to investing directly
  in the hundreds of companies a single ETF can give you exposure relatively cheaply\n\n##
  So why isn’t everybody investing in ETFs only?\n\nLike with any investment instrument
  there are risks, and for ETFs that remains true as well. ETF providers charge fees
  for managing the investment fund. While often these management fees are only in
  the low percentage points, this must be factored into return calculations and depending
  on your investment portfolio, there may be better options.\n\n## The rise in ETFs
  makes Sharesight vital for Australian investors\n\nAs increasing number of investors
  look to diversify their portfolios by including ETFs in their investment mix, it’s
  important to remember that ETFs carry unique tax reporting requirements in some
  countries, particularly Australia due to its [Attribution Managed Investment Trust
  Tax Regime](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/).
  Hence, it is vital for investors in ETFs to use a purpose built portfolio tracking
  tool like Sharesight, which not just provides the [true portfolio performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  but also makes [ETF tax administration](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-makes-etf-tax-admin-easy/)
