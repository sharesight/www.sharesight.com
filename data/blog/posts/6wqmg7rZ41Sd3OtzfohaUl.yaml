:title: Improved portfolio trading cash account tracking
:content: "###### This feature has been improved even further, for more information
  view our [Sharesight Cash Account feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/)
  update\n\nTracking trading cash accounts in Sharesight portfolios has been a highly
  demanded feature. We released [phase 1 of our Cash Account feature in February 2018](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-cash-accounts-in-sharesight/),
  and have just released a major update that automates much of the previously manual
  data entry required to record your cash transactions.\n\nAs part of this update,
  you can now elect to have one of your [manual Cash Accounts](https://help.sharesight.com/creating-a-cash-account/)
  be your nominated trading Cash Account (as long as the Cash Account currency matches
  your portfolio currency).\n\n## How to set up a Cash Account\n\nTo get started,
  simply click ‘Add Cash Account’ on the Portfolio Overview page. From there you can
  specify the name and currency of the Cash Account which will be tied to the portfolio
  (including its [tax residency](https://help.sharesight.com/tax-residency-of-a-portfolio/)).\n\n![Add

  you have [added transactions to the account](https://help.sharesight.com/adding-a-transaction-to-a-cash-account/),
  the balance of the Cash Account will appear at a glance on the Portfolio Overview
  page.\n\n![Tracking trading cash acounts shares](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4AFhX4ij58PnbAAQ7s2kOh/0ae364d7b6ea20367a2e818c494094e5/tracking-trading-cash-acounts-shares.png?w=950)\n\nWith
  Sharesight’s new and improved Cash Account feature, you can now elect to have one
  of your manual Cash Accounts linked to your portfolio as a trading Cash Account
  (as long as the Cash Account currency matches your portfolio currency).\n\nOnce
  you enable this feature, all future trades in the linked portfolio will create a
  corresponding deposit or withdrawal in your nominated Cash Account. You can select
  your trading cash account in your portfolio settings:\n\n![Trading cash account](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/20gvJsKZfQ2aWZMd5miNNo/3c061799202924bd7460b1319a8cbac6/cash-account-screenshot.jpg?w=950)\n\n\n##
  Syncing historical transact to your Cash Account\n\nAfter you have linked your Cash
  Account to a portfolio you can then sync historical transactions from your portfolio
  automatically by clicking on 'Manage Synced Trades' when viewing your Cash Account.
  You can then choose the date to sync trades from automatically.\n\nFor example,
  by selecting a date of 01/12/2016, you can get all transactions after that date
  to sync with the Cash Account then clicking \"Sync all trades\". \n\n![Sync cash

  can expect to view the cash records in the nominated Cash Account as below: \n\n![Cash

  Cash Account notes\n\nThe value of your Cash Account is included when calculating
  your portfolio’s value, but does not impact the [percentage return figure](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/).\n\nYou
  can only use this feature with Sharesight’s built-in Cash Account feature. Due to
  the way [Xero connected cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/) and [Macquarie
  cash accounts](https://help.sharesight.com/adding-a-macquarie-cash-management-account/)
  push data into Sharesight automatically, these accounts sync automatically already.
  \ \n\nAt the moment, Sharesight’s Cash Account feature automatically records buys
  and sell transactions to your Cash Account. Dividend syncing is not yet available.\n\nClicking
  on a Cash Account transaction that has been created from a synced trade will bring
  up the trade \"edit\" form. Cash Account transactions will update automatically
  when the trade is edited. As these transactions are linked, it is not possible to
  edit the cash transaction separately from the underlying trade.\n\n## Upgrade today
