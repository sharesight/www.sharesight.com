:content: |-
  Sharesight has expanded our support for [tracking fractional share trades](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-fractional-shares-with-sharesight/) on markets that support it to *also include* support for fractional shares on exchanges that may only permit trading in whole share units.

  ## Track fractional shares on any exchange? Why?

  While you may not be able to purchase fractional shares on all exchanges (for instance, the NZX or ASX), there are some instances where investors could need to track fractional quantities. Most commonly this will arise when investing through a [robo-advisor](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/asset-managers-and-robo-advisors/) or micro savings/investment apps like [Raiz](https://raizinvest.com.au/) (formerly Acorns Australia), [Sharesies](https://www.sharesies.nz/) in New Zealand, or Wealthsimple that allocate fractions of ETFs to investors to invest the full amount "saved".

  ## Why buy fractional shares?

  Aside from the circumstances above that may result in being allocated fractional quantities of shares, fractional shares offer investors the following benefits/caveats:

  ### Benefits of fractional shares

  * Lets you put your cash to work immediately (rather than waiting to buy a whole share)

  * Helps you best balance your [portfolio allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/does-your-investment-portfolio-match-your-appetite-for-risk/) (single units of a highly-priced share can distort small portfolios)

  * Allows you to make the most of [dollar cost averaging](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/whats-better-dollar-cost-averaging-or-lump-sum-investing/)

  ### Caveats of fractional shares

  * If you own less than 1 share, you typically can’t vote in company elections

  * Rounding may impact your ability to receive dividends - if you own 10% of a share, and that share pays a 1 cent dividend, you may not receive a dividend payment at all

  * Brokers that offer fractional share quantities may charge additional fees for the service
