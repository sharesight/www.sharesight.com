:title: Types of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) – explained
:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not
  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant to obtain
  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIt has taken exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
  less than 25 years since they were first introduced to become a firm favourite of
  investors around the world. In 2018, the assets managed by ETFs globally were [estimated
  at US$6.18 trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/224579/worldwide-etf-assets-under-management-since-1997/),
  largely on the back of the trend towards passive, indexed funds that has taken place
  since the 1990s. Initially promoted as a cheaper alternative than mutual funds,
  ETFs offer investors access to low-cost portfolio diversification as well as tax
  advantages in some regions. \n\nThe ETF sector has grown from offering products
  with a passive exposure to index investing to being widely considered a good starting
  point for investors to gain low-cost exposure to a broad range of investment opportunities.
  \n\nThe growth in popularity of ETFs has come alongside an explosion in the range
  of ETF products offered by fund managers as they seek to satisfy investor demand.
  With an ever-expanding range of ETFs to choose from, investors need to understand
  how they differ, and the roles they can play as part of a diversified investment
  strategy.\n\nThis article explores the various types of ETFs available to investors,
  how they differ, and the roles they play in building an investment portfolio.\n\n![image

  The rise of passive index tracking ETFs\n\nWhile index tracking funds date back
  to the 1970s in the US, these were not considered appropriate for retail investors,
  who were largely content to invest directly or through mutual funds. The first listed
  ETF in the US was [launched in 1993](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/12/brief-history-exchange-traded-funds.asp),
  with other major markets following in the late 1990s and early 2000s. And the resulting
  products appealed to the investing public as an alternative to mutual funds, which
  at the time were often expensive, complicated and illiquid, with large minimum investment
  amounts a clear barrier to entry.\n\nETFs are designed to follow a specific index
  - which may include companies, bonds or commodities - according to established rules.
  For example, a FTSE 100 index would track the 100 largest companies by value on
  the London Stock Exchange. This means that investors must be comfortable with the
  fact that an ETF will only track the market rather than try to outperform it, which
  is what you would expect from an actively managed fund.\n\n## Why are there now
  both active and passive ETFs?\n\nETFs diversify an investment across a range of
  underlying holdings thus spreading the risk. And they are also traded on the stock
  market, meaning they can be traded online at a live market price throughout the
  day, just like regular shares. But while the broad trend has been towards passive
  rather than active management over the past decade, many investors see active ETFs
  as a good compromise between some of the attributes of ETFs and more traditionally
  managed products like some mutual funds.\n\nUnlike index tracking passive funds,
  which seek to deliver returns in line with the underlying index’s performance, actively
  managed funds seek to *outperform* a benchmark index by taking an active role in
  electing when to buy and sell stocks based on the fund manager's research and expertise.
  As with actively managed mutual funds, [active ETFs involve a fund manager](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actively-managed-etf.asp)
  making the investment decisions.  \n\nWhile fund managers are actively trying to
  beat the market in order to optimise returns, active ETF investors must take into
  account that they will be paying for the service of a fund manager and so their
  admin fees will be higher than an index tracking fund. Additionally, active fund
  managers don’t always succeed in outperforming their target benchmark, and investors
  need to assess how this impacts the risk-adjusted rate of return of these funds.\n\n##
  What are Stock ETFs?\n\nThere are many types of ETFs available to investors that
  can be used for a variety of investment outcomes. However, ETFs that track shares
  and are the most common. These usually replicate a share index or invest in a collection
  of listed companies grouped by sector, geographical location or some other common
  feature. Investors should carefully consider the merits and risks of ETFs that track
  niche sectors like technology or healthcare against more straightforward products
  which simply seek to replicate a major stock index like the UK’s FTSE 100 or S&P
  500 in the US. \n\nStock ETFs allow investors an easy way to diversify by [buying
  a basket of shares or assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-etf.asp)
  in a single trade. Investors can also diversify across ETFs so there's less chance
  of loss if an ETF provider collapses. These ETFs also have a low management expense
  ratio (MER) and are often significantly cheaper than actively managed funds.\n\n##
  What are Bond ETFs\n\nBond ETFs track an index of bonds, allowing individual investors
  exposure to an asset class that used to be difficult to access. While bonds are
  the underlying investment, the fact that these ETFs trade on a centralised stock
  exchange give them some attractive ‘equity-like’ features. The bonds in the portfolio
  will vary from, for example, US Treasuries to high-yield bonds, with both long-term
  and short-term holding periods. One of the benefits of [investing in traditional
  bond funds](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/bond-etfs-vs-bonds?nopaging=1)
  is the chance to receive fixed payments on a regular schedule and this is also the
  case with Bond ETFs. \n\nHowever, investors should note that while equity ETFs hold
  every security in their index, that is usually not possible with bonds where there
  may be hundreds, even thousands, of individual securities. This forces bond ETF
  managers to pick and choose which securities in the bond index to include in the
  ETF. These will usually be the most representative sample of the index, based on
  credit quality, exposure, correlations, duration and risk.\n\n## What are Sector
  or Industry ETFs?\n\nIndustry sector ETFs concentrate on particular parts of a global
  or domestic market. Virtually every major industry group has multiple indexes that
  track industry performance. The obvious [benefit of Sector ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector-etf.asp)
  is they provide a means of investing in an entire industry. However, investors should
  be aware that concentrating on a specific sector brings higher risk along with the
  promise of better returns. \n\nFor example, an ETF tracking an energy, real estate
  or biotechnology index is likely to experience wide swings in the value of the underlying
  stocks investments. It is also worth noting that the cost of investing in large
  industry sectors is less than the cost associated with more concentrated industries.
  As with Stock ETFs, these products trade directly in the underlying stocks and shares
  in an index to replicate the performance of the market.\n\n## What are Commodity
  ETFs?\n\nCommodity ETFs are similar to Sector ETFs as they single out a certain
  section of the market, in this case a commodity like precious metals or oil. Commodities
  such as gold are traditionally used as a store of value and a hedge against inflation,
  but retail investors have not always had direct access to these sorts of investments.
  Because commodities are typically negatively correlated with other asset classes,
  such as stocks and bonds, they offer investors [a good way to diversify their investment
  portfolio](https://www.asx.com.au/commodity-etfs-and-etcs.htm). However, investors
  should note that Commodity ETFs do not directly own the asset. Instead, these ETF
  consist of derivative contracts that emulate the price of the underlying commodity.\n\n##
  What are International ETFs?\n\nInternational ETFs can offer investors affordable
  access to global markets. Depending on an investors domestic market, an international
  ETF generally offers exposure to foreign markets without the need for an international
  share trading platform. However, the convenience of being able to invest internationally
  through an investment vehicle trading in your local currency does not remove the
  currency risk implicit in all international investing. Currencies are constantly
  fluctuating and these movements will either enhance or diminish returns from international
  investments.\n\nFor this reason fund managers and ETF providers often [offer both
  currency hedged and unhedged ETFs](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/currency-hedged-etfs-for-strategic-international-market-exposure/)
  that track the same underlying index/securities - but offer different exposure to
  the impact of foreign exchange rates on returns. For example, a currency-hedged
  ETF allows the investor to replicate the holdings of different international indices
  but provide reduced concerns of a fluctuating home currency negatively impacting
  their returns.\n\n## What are Factor or Smart Beta ETFs?\n\nFactor ETFs aim to walk
  a line between traditional, index-tracking ETFs without getting into the complex
  and time-consuming activity of stock picking. Although a form of active management,
  these funds usually just have a bias or ‘tilt’ towards certain stock characteristics,
  like value, size, momentum, quality, dividend yield or low volatility. This investment
  strategy aims to improve on simply ‘buying the market’ as an index tracker of the
  S&P 500 or the FTSE might do. \n\nIt also means taking on significantly more risk
  than investing in the broader stock market but has the potential to [achieve specific
  risk and return objectives.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta-etf.asp)
  As a result, Factor ETFs are generally only appropriate for experienced long-term
  investors who want to pursue a specific strategy and are looking for more transparency
  than you'd find in a traditional actively managed fund.\n\n## Track your investments
