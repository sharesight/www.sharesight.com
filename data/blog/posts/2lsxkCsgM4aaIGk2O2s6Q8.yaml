:title: Wesfarmers Coles demerger details
:content: "On 23 July 2018, Wesfarmers Limited (ASX: WES) [announced](http://www.wesfarmers.com.au/docs/default-source/asx-announcements/coles-demerger-update196f546999c863f7bfccff00000e9025.pdf?sfvrsn=0)
  their intention to demerge the Coles and flybuys businesses from the Wesfarmers
  group in November 2018. As the Wesfarmers/Coles corporate action is likely to impact
  many Australian investors using Sharesight to track their investment portfolio,
  here are the important details:\n\n## Details of the Wesfarmers Coles demerger on
  the ASX \n\n- Demerger of Coles from Wesfarmers Limited is expected to be __completed
  in November 2018__, subject to shareholder and other approvals.\n- Wesfarmers will
  __retain 15% ownership of Coles__.\n- Coles is expected to demerge as a __top 30
  ASX-listed company__.\n- Shareholders will receive new shares in Coles __proportional
  to their existing shareholding__ (after taking into account the 15% of Coles shares
  retained by Wesfarmers).\n- Wesfarmers and Coles will __each own a 50% stake in
  flybuys__.\n- Coles intends to follow Wesfarmers’ approach to dividends, with a
  __dividend payout ratio ranging from 80-90%__.\n- Distribution of Coles shares is
  expected to qualify for [demerger relief from Capital Gains Tax](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/Demergers-and-CGT/Availability-of-CGT-demerger-relief/)
  on the transaction, subject to ATO ruling.\n- James Graham AM to be appointed Chairman
  of Coles on completion of the demerger, and David Cheesewright, Jacqueline Chow
  and Richard Freudenstein to be non-executive directors. Discussions underway with
  potential additional directors.\n\n## Background on the Wesfarmers Coles demerger\n\nThe
  case made by Wesfarmers for the demerger of the Coles portfolio of businesses is
  that the company is repositioning both businesses after a successful turnaround
  of Coles Group Ltd after [purchasing the company for $19.3 billion in 2007](http://www.wesfarmers.com.au/who-we-are/our-history/acquisition-of-coles).
  \n\nColes is a strong business in a market that does not have significant opportunities
  for growth (Australians can only consume a finite amount of groceries and liquor
  each week), so through this demerger Wesfarmers seeks to allocate more capital to
  businesses with higher earnings growth potential. \n\nWesfarmers Managing Director
  Rob Scott said the demerger represented a significant repositioning of the group’s
  portfolio:\n\n“Post-demerger, Wesfarmers will have a portfolio of cash generative
  businesses, with strong returns on capital, good momentum and leading positions
  in their respective markets.” \n\n“Following a successful turnaround under Wesfarmers’
  ownership, Coles has developed strong investment fundamentals as a mature and cash
  generative business with a resilient earnings profile. Coles is well-positioned
  to be operated and owned separately, having established strong corporate infrastructure
  and management capabilities under Wesfarmers’ model of divisional autonomy.”\n\n##
