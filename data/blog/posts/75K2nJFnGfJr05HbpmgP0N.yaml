:title: TSX-60 sector and stock performance 2013-2018
:url_slug: tsx-60-sector-and-stock-performance-2013-2018
:content: "Since investors using Sharesight typically tend to lean towards a [‘buy
  and hold’ investing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-reasons-why-buy-and-hold-investors-use-sharesight/)
  philosophy, it’s important to look at returns over longer periods. In this post,
  we’re examining the returns of stocks in Canada’s [TSX-60 (TSE-60) index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P/TSX_60)
  and the corresponding returns for each sector and key stocks in each sector of the
  index in order to look for underlying trends over the last 5 years (2013-2018).\n\n##
  Sharesight performance calculation methodology\n\nSharesight calculates *annualised*
  returns that *include dividends* - we do this using a [dollar weighted return](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/)
  calculation method when there are multiple buy/sell trades within a measurement
  period. For this exercise we \"purchased\" a single parcel of each stock on 1 Jan
  \ 2013 and used [Sharesight’s performance report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  to calculate the annualised return including dividends (total annualised return)
  through to 31 December 2018. In this post we've used [Sharesight's compounded annual
  return](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/) to calculate
  these annualised returns.\n\n## TSX-60 performance 2013-2018 \n\n![TSX-60 Performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3sKxaMLpcYD5Sfp6XWMrkA/1c9023a2e0650517142ff2de6cacfa7a/TSX-60_Performance.png?w=950)\n\nUsing
  the [iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/products/239832/ishares-sptsx-60-index-etf)
  as a proxy to capture the dividend and capital gain performance of the TSX-60 index
  in Sharesight (read our [rationale for benchmarking your portfolio against ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)),
  we find an extremely strong performance for the index through to August 2014 before
  falling away, underpinning the importance of understanding the impact of [holding
  periods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiod.asp) in your investment
  performance.\n\nOver the 5 years from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2018, TSX:XUI
  recorded a 6.81% total annual return, with 3.37% of that return coming from dividends.\n\n##
  Performance of each sector in the TSX-60\n\nSharesight uses the [FactSet Revere
  Business Industry Classification System](https://open.factset.com/products/factset-rbics/en-us)
  to classify companies by industry and sector (when looking at a holding in Sharesight,
  this information is available in the ‘instrument detail’ section).\n\n![Sharesight
  instrument detail](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6cdQG4jgDynboVO8ssI3oP/630cd5e2fcb5094c3d1eb29cfbf9b010/Sharesight_instrument_detail.png?w=950)\n\nWe
  used this sector break down to split out the performance by sector within the TSX-60
  over the 2013-2018 period. Here’s that performance by sector -- simply click on
