:content: "With Sharesight, investors can track the price and performance of over
  **40,000 Canadian mutual funds** along with the rest of the investments in their
  portfolio. Canadian investors will also benefit from Sharesight’s support for leading
  Canadian and US stock exchanges, which are some of more than [40 global stock exchanges](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/)
  and mutual fund markets that we support. To learn more about Sharesight’s support
  for Canadian mutual funds and how you can track these funds in your portfolio, keep
  reading. \n\n![Track Canadian mutual funds with Sharesight (4)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4NDZLze6nwrAqifUYWK831/cd1a7894e9dea916644f03ce728b375a/Track_Canadian_mutual_funds_with_Sharesight__4_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Why you should track your investments with Sharesight\n\nSharesight supports over
  [40 key global markets](https://www.sharesight.com/au/faq/#which-stock-exchanges-does-sharesight-support),
  including the Canadian (CNSX), Toronto (TSE) and Toronto TSX Ventures (CVE) stock
  exchanges, plus leading US exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
  and Nasdaq. This is in addition to our support for over [75 currencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-investments-in-fx-currencies-with-sharesight/)
  and more than [170 leading brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/)
  worldwide. With the ability to track the price and performance of investments across
  different asset classes, markets, currencies and brokers, Sharesight is the ultimate
  portfolio tracker for global investors. \n\nUnlike the data provided by most brokers,
  Sharesight takes into account the impact of capital gains, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/),
  brokerage fees and currency fluctuations when calculating returns – giving investors
  the full picture of their portfolio’s performance. Sharesight also offers a range
  of powerful reports for self-directed investors including Performance, Portfolio
  Diversity, Contribution Analysis, and Multi-Currency Valuation. The ability to track
  cash accounts, property and even cryptocurrency is just another reason that investors
  should consider using Sharesight to track their investment portfolio.\n\n## Canadian
  mutual fund support in Sharesight\n\nSharesight supports all Canadian mutual funds
  covered by Morningstar price data — over 40,000 — which will continue to grow as
  additional mutual funds enter the market and are included in the Sharesight database.
  Fund data dates as far back as 1 January 2000, with prices updated daily by end-of-day,
  Canadian time.\n\nAs users add Canadian mutual fund investments to their portfolios,
  they can get the full picture of their investment performance by viewing their fund
  investments with the rest of their holdings, whether they be stocks, ETFs or custom
  investments such as property or term deposits. This makes it easy for investors
  to see the impact of specific investments as part of the overall return of their
  portfolio.\n\n![Sharesight Canadian portfolio example](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5MgPBtjIIbw6xlcSrZG94R/7bffbefef8efc7c6d40bb56b81db8c2a/Sharesight_Canadian_portfolio_example.jpg?w=950)\n<small>
