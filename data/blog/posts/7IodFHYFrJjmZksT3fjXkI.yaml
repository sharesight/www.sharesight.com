:title: View and export your trading history with the All Trades Report
:content: "Sharesight’s [All Trades Report](https://help.sharesight.com/trades_report/)
  makes it easy to view your trading history at a glance over any chosen period. The
  report provides investors with a list of all buy and sell trades made over the selected
  date range, with the ability to classify trades by market, currency, country and
  a range of other factors. This information can also be [exported into a range of
  different file formats](https://help.sharesight.com/exporting-a-report/), making
  it a convenient way to share your trading history with your accountant or financial
  advisor. \n\n![View and export trading history Sharesight All Trades Report 0](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2iGptmKwHK936tVz5UmQ23/1cfefe6788f2d5ecb297275ac2936c43/View_and_export_trading_history_Sharesight_All_Trades_Report_0.jpg?w=950)\n\nTo
  learn more about how to make the most of Sharesight’s All Trades Report, keep reading.\n\n##
  1. View your trading history at a glance \n\nThe All Trades Report is the perfect
  way to view your trading history at a glance. The report generates a list of your
  trading activity including key information such as the **trade date**, **trade type**
  (buy, sell or adjustment), **quantity of shares** traded, **price** and **brokerage
  fees**, **exchange rate** and **trade value**. This is helpful for investors looking
  for a way to break down the cost base of a particular basket of trades. \n\n**Note:**
  Adjustment trades include stock splits, bonus issues, consolidations, cancellations,
  return of capital, mergers and adjusted cost base transactions. To view these trades,
  simply toggle on ‘include adjustments’ at the top of the page. \n\n![All trades

  trades. </small>\n\n## 2. Run the report over any date range \n\nThe All Trades
  Report allows Sharesight users to download their trading history over any custom
  date range. The screenshot below, for example, shows the report being filtered over
  the previous financial year. This would be useful for investors sending the report
  to their accountant for tax reporting purposes. \n\n![All Trades Report custom dates

  </small>\n\n## 3. Choose your grouping classifications\n\nWith the All Trades Report,
  investors can choose to group their trades by a range of classifications, including:
  \n\n* Market \n\n* Currency\n\n* Sector\n\n* Industry\n\n* Investment type \n\n*
  Country \n\n* No group \n\n* [Custom groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)\n\nThe
  screenshot below, for instance, shows the report filtered by currency. This is especially
  useful for global investors who need this data for tax reporting, as it allows you
  to easily evaluate the impact of foreign exchange rates on your trades. \n\n![All
