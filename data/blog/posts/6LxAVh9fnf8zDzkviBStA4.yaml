:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not
  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant to obtain
  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIf you’re looking to calculate the capital
  gains tax (CGT) on your investment portfolio for the 2020-2021 tax year, then you’ve
  come to the right place. Sharesight’s award-winning investment portfolio tracker
  includes a powerful Australian [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/)
  that functions as a CGT calculator. Built by self-directed investors, for self-directed
  investors, the report:\n\n- **Takes care of the maths** so you don’t have to struggle
  with a complicated [spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/).\n-
  **Optimises your tax position** by letting you experiment with different [sale allocation
  methods](#sale-allocation-methods).\n- **Is available to run at any time, over any
  time period**. So not only will you have the information you need at tax time, but
  throughout the year. This means fewer surprises when the next tax season rolls around.\n\n![Capital

  Calculate your portfolio CGT with Sharesight\n\nSharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/) is the perfect CGT calculator,
  determing capital gains made on sold shares as per [Australian Tax Office (ATO)
  rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/Templates/Content.aspx?pageid=30591) (for those of
  you in Canada, we also offer a [Canadian CGT Report](/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/)).\n\nYou
  may run the report over any period in order to see:\n\n- The CGT position for all
  your holdings sold within the period.\n- Your CGT gains broken-up into short and
  long term, as well as your losses.\n- A summary of the short and long term gains
  and losses, as well as any capital gain or claimable loss.\n\n![Capital Gains Tax
  Calculator Australia 2021](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6JTtlOOQa22hC4SdAoCl7U/9118724b7a0ae443b83e9f9155a6b57b/Capital_Gains_Tax_Calculator_Australia_2021.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Australian tax settings\n\nThe [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/)
  uses the '[discount method](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/Working-out-your-capital-gain/The-discount-method-of-calculating-your-capital-gain/)'
  for shares that have been held for more than 1 year and the ‘other method’ for shares
  held for less than one year. The discount rate is based on the Australian tax settings
  you select when setting up your portfolio:\n\n- **Individuals / Trust** – CGT discount
  of 50 %\n- **Self Managed Super Fund** – CGT discount of 33⅓ %\n- **Company** –
  CGT discount of nil\n\n### Sale allocation methods\n\nThe Capital Gains Tax Report
  also allows you to specify the sale allocation method at the overall portfolio and
  individual holding level to determine your optimum position, including:\n\n- **First
  In, First Out (FIFO)** – Sharesight assumes that you sell your longest held shares
  first.\n- **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** – Sharesight assumes that you sell your
  most recently purchased shares first.\n- **Minimise Gain** – Sharesight assumes
  that you sell shares with the highest purchase price first.\n- **Maximise Gain**
  – Sharesight assumes that you sell shares with the lowest purchase price first.\n-
  **Minimise CGT** – Sharesight assumes that you sell shares that will result in the
  lowest capital gains tax first. This method is more sophisticated than the ‘Minimise
  capital gain’ method because it takes into account the Australian CGT discounting
  rules.\n\nThe sale allocation method can be changed for specific holdings or for
  the entire portfolio:\n\n![Capital Gains Tax Sale Allocation Methods - 2021](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2NwJViKWOajHaIE22xsVs7/0ee50c8134e93cd4c0d25b057bb8a279/Capital_Gains_Tax_Sale_Allocation_Methods_-_2021.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Notes on the Capital Gains Tax Report\n\n- You may carry forward any losses from
  the previous reporting period.\n- Once you’re happy with your report, you may choose
  to “lock” it. This allows you to alter the sale allocation methods in future reporting
  periods without invalidating the result for previous periods.\n- For more information
  visit the [Australian Capital Gains Tax Report help page](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/).\n\n###

  reports, your entire Capital Gains Tax Report can be downloaded to Excel, PDF or
  [Google Sheets](/blog/new-open-sharesight-reports-directly-google-sheets/).\n- **Share
  your portfolio with your accountant** – With your capital gains and losses automatically
