  the market-moving news behind them. This article details the top 20 buy and sell
  trades made by SMSFs in September 2020. To find out the news behind these stocks,

  (ASX: CSL) secured [two new deals](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/csl-to-manufacture-81m-covid-19-vaccines-by-mid-2021-20200907-p55szi)
  this month to manufacture vaccines for Covid-19, with the potential to manufacture
  into 2022. While [analysts agree](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/too-risky-to-factor-in-covid-vaccine-upside-to-csl-20200908-p55tki)
  that there is positive market sentiment around this news, they have also raised
  concerns about CSL’s declining plasma donations, which are a key part of the company’s
  core business operations. \n\n**Sydney Airport** (ASX: SYD) was the most-bought
  stock by SMSFs in September. The company has seen a massive drop in its revenue
  since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and this has been reflected in its
  share price. The airport reported a 35% revenue decrease in its [HY20 report](https://www.raskmedia.com.au/2020/08/11/sydney-airport-asxsyd-releases-fy20-report-and-2-billion-capital-raising/),
  while also announcing a $2 billion capital raise. [Analysts are split](https://www.afr.com/wealth/investing/buy-hold-sell-sydney-airport-woolworths-brickworks-oil-search-cba-20201002-p561e3)
  on this stock, which was performing well before the pandemic, but currently has
  a high debt-to-equity ratio and an uncertain economic recovery ahead. \n\n**Woodside
  Petroleum** (ASX: WPL) has done well throughout FY20, [leading output growth](https://www.energynewsbulletin.net/production/news/1396033/woodside-leads-australian-oil-output-growth)
  in the Australian oil industry. However, Woodside’s share prices have recently [declined](https://www.rumrebellion.club/2020/09/22/oil-prices-fall-dragging-down-aussie-oil-companies-with-it/)
  due to a drop in oil prices. This could threaten Woodside’s ability to secure long-term
  contracts for investments in offshore gas fields, and has [already caused delays](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/qatar-flexes-muscles-with-cuts-to-gas-prices-20200918-p55x4b)
  in the company’s plan to develop a second LNG train at Pluto in Western Australia.
  \n\n**Afterpay** (ASX: APT) was the most-sold stock by SMSFs in September. The company
  had an eventful month, announcing the resignation of CFO Luke Bartoli and the [appointment
  of Rebecca Lowde](https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/afterpay-turns-to-new-chief-financial-officer-20200924-p55yu3)
  in his place. Afterpay also suffered a decline in its share prices following news
  that [Paypal is launching its own BNPL service](https://stockhead.com.au/tech/bnpl-leaders-afterpay-zip-sink-as-paypal-circles/),
  Pay-in-4. \n\n**Telstra** (ASX: TLS) has seen a massive decline in its share price
  over the past few months, recently hitting a [52-week low](https://www.fool.com.au/2020/09/17/telstra-asxtls-share-price-hits-a-52-week-low-is-this-a-buying-opportunity-for-investors/)
  following weak FY21 guidance. However, things are looking up for Telstra, with the
  telco launching its [5G home internet plans](https://www.zdnet.com/article/telstra-takes-wraps-off-5g-fixed-wireless-service/)
  and entering into a [partnership with Microsoft](https://www.afr.com/technology/telstra-to-push-tech-ambitions-with-microsoft-partnership-20200924-p55ysz)
  to develop products using 5G, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. \n\n**Commonwealth
  Bank** (ASX: CBA) made an attempt to hit back at the BNPL market this past month,
  announcing its intention to launch a [no-interest credit card](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/millennial-wallets-in-sights-as-cba-spruiks-no-interest-card-20200910-p55ucu).
  At the same time, CBA is facing fresh [money laundering allegations](https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/macquarie-cba-face-fresh-money-laundering-scrutiny-after-data-leak-20200921-p55xmg.html)
  following a leak of secret bank reports connecting CBA to millions of dollars worth
  of transactions traced to suspicious activity. \n\n**The a2 Milk Company** (ASX:
  A2M) saw a significant [drop in its share price](https://www.fool.com.au/2020/10/01/the-a2-milk-asxa2m-share-price-crashed-17-5-lower-in-september/)
  following the release of its [updated FY21 outlook](https://themarketherald.com.au/the-a2-milk-company-asxa2m-releases-updated-fy21-outlook-2020-09-28/),
  which revealed the impact of Covid-19 on daigou sales of the company’s products.
  There are also questions over the longevity of a2’s [relationship with China](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/profit-jumps-for-a2-milk-on-surging-china-sales-20200819-p55n1f.html)
  in general, considering the recent strain in Australia-China relations.\n\n**Zip
  Co** (ASX: Z1P) has seen its [share price plummet](https://www.fool.com.au/2020/10/01/the-zip-asxz1p-share-price-crashed-33-lower-in-september/)
  from its all-time high in August, with investors concerned over Paypal’s announcement
  of Pay-in-4, as well as the announcement of [no-interest credit cards](https://themarketherald.com.au/aussie-banks-take-on-afterpay-zip-co-in-bnpl-battle-2020-09-16/)
  from CBA and NAB. September also saw the appointment of a [new director](https://itmunch.com/zip-co-director-retires-while-bnpl-appoints-pippa-downes/)
  who is expected to lead the company’s global expansion. \n\n## Keep track of your
