:title: Issues that could make or break SMSFs in 2019
:content: "I attended the Sydney end of year lunch of the SMSF Association - the premiere
  body representing SMSF practitioners.\n\n2019 is going to be a challenging year
  with several headwinds for SMSFs. This was expertly covered by speakers coming at
  it from different angles.\n\n## Key findings from ASIC’s Report 576\n\nTracey Besters
  from SMSF Design covered the key findings from the ASIC report on SMSFs released
  in June 2018. The reports are:\n\n* [Report 575](https://download.asic.gov.au/media/4779820/rep-575-published-28-june-2018.pdf):
  *SMSFs: Improving the quality of advice and member experiences*\n\n* [Report 576](https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-576-member-experiences-with-self-managed-superannuation-funds/):
  *Member experiences with self-managed superannuation funds*\n\n![ASIC SMSF REPORTS](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5uk32k5X7GQwCaogOWeCIK/082bfdd1bb765cb32552a2ace190c22b/ASIC_SMSF_REPORTS.png?w=950)\n<small>Source:
  ASIC website (REP 576)</small>\n\nMy key takeaway from the talk was that trustees
  in SMSFs needed to be educated a lot more on the compliance measures, investment
  strategies and the [costs of running an SMSF](/blog/smsf-unbundling--how-much-can-it-save-you-in-2017/).\n\n##
  Outlook for 2019\n\nBelinda Allen, Senior Economist from Commsec gave an overview
  of the outlook for 2019 for global as well as domestic share markets. The context
  for global uncertainty is the war between US President Trump and Chinese President
  Xi on the one hand, and between the Fed and President Trump on the other.\n\nIn
  Australia, the key indicators of economics are in the charts below. Household wealth,
  house prices and credit growth have all been on the decline. Consumer spending has
  also been flat in in recent months.\n\n![Outlook for SMSF investors 2018](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/29C8TxgrkAM6OAga0ywqqA/9bd4c070d1c56ed799a30e3d49eef6b2/Outlook_for_SMSF_investors_2018.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  addition, some key takeaways we got out of the session were:\n\n* In the USA, tensions
  between the Federal Reserve and President Trump may be easing with the Fed suggesting
  recently they are approaching ‘neutral’ rate settings. This implies that the differential
  in interest rates between the USA and Australia won’t increase much further. As
  a result the AUD is forecast to reach 75 US cents by the end of 2019.\n\n* Other
  headwinds for markets take the form of Brexit-related uncertainty and high volatility
  in oil prices.\n\n* In Australia, it looks unlikely that there will be any increase
  in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia through most of 2019. \n\n*
  Share markets have seen a change in investor sentiment this year, with 2018 looking
  like it may be a net negative year for the ASX 200.\n\n## Sharesight investors track
