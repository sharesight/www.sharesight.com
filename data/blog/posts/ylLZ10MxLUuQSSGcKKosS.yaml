:title: Do demergers & spin-offs create value for shareholders?
:url_slug: do-demergers-and-spin-offs-create-value-for-shareholders
:content: "Large conglomerate style businesses need to strike the right balance between
  two competing theories - diversification and core-competency. On the one hand, diversification
  across multiple businesses offers economies of scale from shared operations, on
  the other, it’s difficult for a conglomerate to \"focus\" on everything. In order
  to strike the right balance between these competing forces, a conglomerate can choose
  to ‘de-merge’ or ‘spin-off’ one or more operating units into its own company, creating
  a separate entity, with both demerged companies positioned to better focus on their
  respective core competencies.\n\nBut do demergers and spin-offs always create value
  for shareholders? As with everything in life, it depends and needs to be looked
  at closely.\n\n![do-demerrgers-create-value-shareholders](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3kokWWdVji8My24Q6I2qEg/38338615a12b081d7553194561a15cd2/do-demerrgers-create-value-shareholders.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a demerger?\n\nA demerger or a spin-off is a [corporate action](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-corporate-action/)
  in which a business unit or a part of a large organisation or a conglomerate, is
  carved out and listed as a separate company on the stock exchange.\n\nIn a demerger,
  the parent company transfers a proportional number of shares in the spun-off entity
  to its shareholders. Usually, the parent company continues to hold a substantial
  shareholding position in the spun-off company.\n\n## What does a demerger mean for
  shareholders?\n\nWhen a spin-off happens, shareholders in the original entity automatically
  acquire shares in the newly created business. The original entity will also adjust
  the ‘cost base’ of their shares, and also set the [cost base](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/Shares,-units-and-similar-investments/Demergers-and-CGT/Cost-base-calculations/)
  for the shares issued in the demerged entity.\n\nMany analysts have looked at the
  performance of demerger announcements and their impact on shareholders’ equity.
  The general belief among many analysts and observers is that a spin-off is usually
  beneficial to shareholders (see chart below) of the parent as well as the spun-off
  companies.\n\n## Demerger example: Fairfax (ASX:FXJ) - Domain (ASX:DHG)\n\nWhile
  ultimately the market decides the value of shares for each demerged or spin-off
  company, for tax reasons, a company demerger or spin-off will follow a structure
  similar to below.\n\nLet’s work through a real example of the [Domain group’s demerger
  from Fairfax media group](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/fairfax-fxj-and-domain-dhg-demerger-details/).\n\nThe
  salient features of the demerger from the [Fairfax shareholders website](https://www.fairfaxmedia.com.au/investors/welcome/domain-separation/domain-separation?Embed=Y)
  were:\n\n* Fairfax media(FXJ) would hold 60% share in the new Domain group(DHG)
  \n\n* For every 10 shares an investor in Fairfax holds, s/he would get 1 share of
  Domain group(DHG)\n\n* The tax cost base of FXJ shares should be reduced by $0.233
  per share\n\n* The tax cost base per DHG share can be calculated by taking your
  Capital Reduction Entitlement ($0.233 times the number of FXJ Shares held on Scheme
  Record Date)and dividing it by the number of DHG shares received. Subject to rounding,
  the DHG shares should have a tax cost base of approximately **$2.33 per share**\n\n*
  The Scheme Record Date is 7:00 pm on 17 November 2017\n\nIf an investor owned 10,000
  shares in FXJ on 17 November 2017, s/he would be issued 1,000 shares in DHG. Let’s
  assume that s/he had bought these 10,000 shares on 1 November 2016 at a price of
  $0.825, therefore a investment cost base of $8,250.\n\nOn 22 November 2017, s/he
  would own both 10,000 shares in Fairfax media (FXJ) and 1,000 shares in Domain (DHG).
  The cost base of the 1,000 DHG shares would be $2.33 x 1000 = $2,330.\n\nThe cost
  base of the FXJ shares would be adjusted by $0.233 x 10,000 = $2,320 from the original
  cost base of $8,250 through a return of capital corporate action. This means that
  the new adjusted cost base of the FXJ shares would be 8,250 - 2,330 = $5,920.\n\nThe
  below table shows the performance of the Fairfax and Domain holdings a year after
  the demerger or spin-off.\n\n![domain(DHG)vsFairfax(FXJ)performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3vblokJ1aU4UwAouSqyyWq/9d3dd8383ce4e0ca7faea705ec5fb4e9/domain_DHG_vsFairfax_FXJ_performance.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Advantages of a demerger\n\nAre there pros to a divorce or a break up, you might
  ask? In the case of a corporate spin-off, there certainly are some advantages.\n\n1.
  Focus on core competency of the spun-off entity.\n\n2. Management accountability
  of the spun-off division ensures each division can take care of its own financial
  positions without any cross-subsidies.\n\nShareholders of the demerged entities
  enjoy the benefits of more focussed businesses with management accountability driving
  the intrinsic value of each company, pushing their respective share prices higher
  than had they remained a combined entity.\n\n## Downsides of a demeger \n\nThere
  are still significant risks in a demerger or a spin-off, some of which include:
  \n\n* The parent might spin-off completely unwanted assets and debt\n\n* Potential
  loss of synergies between the parent and the spin-off (which are not documented)\n\n##
  How have demergers performed?\n\nLike with everything in investing, nothing is foolproof.
  Spin-offs are preferred over IPOs by investors. Their assets are better known compared
  with initial public offerings (IPOs) and have been subject to disclosure rules for
  years. There is also better alignment of incentives because the parent company wants
  its offspring to succeed, given its shareholders have received stock in the new
  entity. IPOs on the other hand are driven by incentives of the investment banks
  and private equity holders - which is to maximise listing value on day one.\n\nHave
  some spin-offs underperformed after being spun off? Some definitely have. Have a
  look at the table below to see some of spin-offs from recent times and their performance.\n\n<table>\n

  you keep track of demerged shares\n\nThe magic of Sharesight really comes to life
  when you own shares in a business that undergoes a corporate spin-off or demerger.
  We regularly inform our clients about the mechanics of popular demergers and corporate
  spin-offs via our blog and help site. Specifically, here’s how Sharesight helps
  with demergers:\n\n* [Working out the historical base](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/at-a-glance-cost-base-per-share/):
  When you receive shares in the new entity after a corporate demerger, most online
  brokers will not show you the cost base of the new shares. They will show a cost
  base of $0 and therefore all performance reporting will be wrong.\n\n* [Capital
  gains tax reporting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculate-your-capital-gains-tax-without-a-spreadsheet-or-calculator/):
  As a corollary of the fact that online brokers don’t know your historical cost base,
  they can’t quite work out what your capital gains are as a result of the demerger.\n\nSharesight
  also provides detailed step-by-step guides on how to track your cost base and manage
  these demergers with your portfolio. Recent examples are listed below:\n\n* [Wesfarmers
  and Cole demerger](https://help.sharesight.com/wesfarmers-and-coles-demerger/)\n\n*
  [Fairfax and Domain group demerger](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/fairfax-fxj-and-domain-dhg-demerger-details/)\n\n*
  [NAB and Clydesdale bank demerger](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-handle-the-nab-demerger-and-cyb-ipo/)\n\n*
