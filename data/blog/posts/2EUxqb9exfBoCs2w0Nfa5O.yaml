:content: |-
  Valentines day was extra special this year with the rollout of performance parameter caching for all users. This offers substantial page load improvements especially for large portfolios. We’ve also made a solid start on our much anticipated integration with Interactive Brokers -- we should have more to say about that in the next release notes! Meanwhile here’s what else we’ve been up to in February:

  ## Broker Import

  - Added support for Praemium trading history file, allowing Praemium users to more easily transition to Sharesight.

  ## Usability

  - Replace loading spinners with ‘skeletons’ on the overview page.
  - Minor design revisions for mobile devices - removed unnecessary padding, fix alignment issues, add columns on tablet and phone landscape orientation.
  - Created a new Integrations tab and moved portfolio sharing to the settings tab. This will make it easier to configure broker integrations in future.
  - Improve CSV import screen to display values up to 10 decimal places without recourse to scientific notation.
  - Allow the use of special characters in custom group names.
  - Various bug fixes / enhancements for IE11 (But please use a modern browser if you can, IE11 is outdated and offers a poor experience by comparison).
  - Added an ex date column to the Future Income Report along with various layout improvements.
  - Security
  - Require confirmation of existing password when changing password.
  - Introduce Content Security Policy headers as further protection against cross site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and content injection attacks.

  ## Sharesight API
  - API V3 (in beta): Added an endpoint to return performance for a benchmark instrument.
