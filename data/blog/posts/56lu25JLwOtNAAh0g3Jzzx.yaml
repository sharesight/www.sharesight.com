:title: How to maximise your retirement savings
:url_slug: maximise-retirement-savings
:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not
  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser or accountant
  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nWhen it comes to building wealth
  for retirement, the sooner you start, the sooner the magic of compounding kicks
  in. Whether you prefer stocks, bonds, property, alternative assets or a combination
  of those things, time in the market can help your portfolio reach great heights.\n\nSo
  if you’ve already started your wealth-building journey – congratulations. If you
  haven’t – today is the perfect time to begin using these three tips to maximise
  your investment returns for retirement.\n\n## 1) Exploit the power of compounding\n\nCompound
  accumulation is a powerful force. For example, if you start with an investment of
  $50,000 in stocks that returns 7% per annum, and you automatically reinvest your
  dividends, your investment will be worth $193,484 after only 20 years.\n\nBut your
  investment portfolio doesn’t stand still. If you start with that $50,000 initial
  investment, and invest an additional $10,000 annually (and earn the same return),
  your portfolio will be worth $603,439 after 20 years. At the end of year one, you've
  invested $50,000 and earned $3,500. By the end of year 20, you've invested $250,000
  and earned $353,439. That's the power of compounding.\n\n![Impact of Compounding](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5tw5BNUWLSs5ecUmtA8eCx/9ad99bef9296d3ee6a2c1dbda096161e/Impact_of_Compounding.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  2) Reinvest your dividends\n\nThe fastest way to grow your portfolio is to [reinvest
  your dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/).
  Commonly known as a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRP,  investors can opt-in to
  have their dividends reinvested automatically – saving investors brokerage fees.\n\nBrokerage
  fees, over the long term, can be surprisingly costly. For example, let’s say dividend
  reinvestment saves you $100 per year in brokerage. If we again assume a 7% return,
  that compounds to $10,200 over 30 years.\n\n## 3) Capitalise on retirement tax concessions\n\nMany
  governments offer retirement vehicles and incentives, such as [SMSFs in Australia](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  where self-directed investors can take advantage of tax advantaged investing for
  their retirement. In Australia for example: when you invest pre-tax income into
  superannuation, it is taxed at 15%, compared to a top income tax rate of 45%. \n\nInvestors
  would be wise to research these schemes (and consult their accountant or financial
  planner to discuss).  \n\n## What gets measured gets managed\n\nYour retirement
  may be decades away, but there’s no time to waste in building your retirement income.
  The investment decisions you make today could deliver tens of thousands or even
  hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of compounded returns by the time you retire.\n\nAs
  they say, what gets measured gets managed. That’s why investors building their retirement
  wealth track their investments with tools like [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/).
  \n\nWhatever you do, just make sure you take action, because if you want to be sitting
  comfortably in the shade years from now, you need to plant the seed for the tree
  today.\n\n## Track your progress towards retirement with Sharesight\n\nIf you're
