:title: How financial advisors meet AFSL requirements with Sharesight Pro
:url_slug: financial-advisors-afsl-requirements-sharesight-pro
:content: "We talk to financial advisors Ben Wieland and Ben Widdup from [EGU](https://www.egu.com.au/)
  about how [Sharesight Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/) helps improve the quality
  of conversations with their clients. We also discuss how the firm uses the [Consolidated
  View](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/) feature to meet their AFSL
  requirements, why the [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  is so useful and what their clients like most about Sharesight. \n\n![EGU case study

  1. Tell us a bit about EGU and what you do there. \n\nWe are a self-licensed financial
  planning firm that was born out of an existing accounting firm and family business
  which started a wealth management division. We create portfolios for clients based
  around listed products with a strong influence on overseas investments.\n\nAs for
  our client base, a lot of our clients came from our existing accounting firm, which
  is much older than the wealth management division. Because of that we manage a lot
  of SMSFs. In terms of life stage, about 50% of our clients are young to middle age
  and the other 50% would be either just pre-retirement or in retirement. \n\n## 2.
  How do you use Sharesight Pro in your business?\n\nWe go into Sharesight every day
  and review every client’s portfolio. And for high-level management purposes, we
  have created a [consolidated group](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/)
  which is under the firm’s name and have added every client’s portfolio to that.
  That way, we can see at any point in time all the funds under advisement for our
  firm. \n\n### Clients\n\nEvery client has access to their portfolio and all of our
  clients go to Sharesight for reporting – no one goes to Saxo Markets (which is the
  main broker we use). One of the big things to remember is that brokers aren’t reporting
  houses – they’re an intermediary to get you the asset. Sharesight’s reporting is
  the best in the business. \n\nWe generate Sharesight reports for clients. Every
  physical meeting we go to, we print out the [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  the [Performance Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/)
  (in terms of percentage and cash) and the [Contribution Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  (to see how much each asset class is contributing). We hand this to the clients,
  but it’s more of a \"nice to have in hand\" bit of paper, rather than any new information
  for the clients, as they will have already looked at their portfolio on Sharesight.
  \n\nIn terms of feedback, our clients love Sharesight. They really enjoy the ease
  of access, the look of it and having the information at hand. The quality of our
  conversations with clients has really improved. It’s less of \"This is what’s happened\"
  and more “What are we doing? What’s happening in the future? Are we changing this,
  are we tweaking that? Is there any need to rebalance?” It’s just a much better quality
  of conversation. \n\n### Integrations\n\nWe use [Macquarie CMA](https://help.sharesight.com/adding-a-macquarie-cash-management-account/)
  for every client that has a portfolio. Not for platform clients but any non-platform
  client (which is the vast majority) where we’re using Saxo and Sharesight Pro has
  a Macquarie CMA account, whether that’s inside or outside of super. We segregate
  those investment funds from their day-to-day cash account and run them as a portfolio,
  so the integration works really well. \n\n### AFSL requirements\n\nWe have to renew
  our professional indemnity insurance policy every year and they ask us what our
  funds under advisement are and what is the break-up of the funds between ETFs, managed
  funds, cash, etc. The [Consolidated View](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/)
  feature gives us that information. So when the insurance firm asks, \"How much have
  you got in ETFs?\" we can say we’ve got 62% (for example). \n\n## 3. Which feature
  do you find the most useful?\n\nProbably the [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  because it allows us to have conversations about where portfolios are going. This
  is really useful because our investment philosophy is that a portfolio’s overall
  construction is more important than any one investment held inside the portfolio.
  So some of the questions we ask are do they have enough exposure to certain asset
  classes? Or do they have too much exposure? Are we starting to see inflation creep
  in and if so, how do we hedge that? That’s what the Diversity Report really gives
  you. \n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #E5E7E8; background-color: #F4F4EF; margin-bottom:
