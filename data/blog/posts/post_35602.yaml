:title: A tale of three Aussie funds
:url_slug: a-tale-of-three-aussie-funds
:content: "We’re proponents of [managed funds](/blog/managed-funds-live-on-sharesight/).
  Several of us began our careers in the funds management industry. Trusting a professional
  to provide sector or regional diversification continues to create wealth for millions
  of people around the world since managed/mutual funds took off in the early 1980s.\n\nBut
  there are pitfalls to avoid and Aussie share funds are responsible for some of the
  most hazardous.\n\n![Kangaroos - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1PJyoejNSIkycUYOkOOo4Y/e172ab7786ba5a887411224734f1e901/featured_kangaroos.jpg?w=950)\n\nWhen
  you part ways with 2% of the assets you invest (remember that 2% might represent
  25% of your total return!) you want confidence that the person/team you’re entrusting
  your money to is worth it. You want them to have ideas. You want them to have conviction.\n\nThe
  trouble is that this conviction looks awfully similar from one manager to the next.
  By opening the bonnet<sup>1</sup> on three of the most popular Australian share
  funds we can see just how similar they are. Purposefully, we’ve picked three fund
  companies headquartered in different corners of the globe, each running an Aussie
  share strategy. Here are their top 10 holdings:\n\n![table - 3 aussie funds](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/kqS1qF2G1UQE0sw2w6CKa/c67d44d6dd6b21812328c322fa0ebce8/table_3-aussie-funds.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  an equally weighted portfolio of these three funds, 9 of the top 10 holdings are
  common across all three. The only “outlier” is Woolworth’s, which is held by Schroder
  and Perpetual.\n\nOf the 30 shares held across the funds’ top 10 positions, 23 are
  the same.\n\nWhen you compare these active managers to the index ([Vanguard Australian
  Share ETF](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8205/?overview)),
  only one (one!) company is not represented by the managers: CSL Ltd.\n\nBasically,
  this means you’re paying a manager 2% to not buy CSL.\n\nIf you’re looking for a
  dramatic twist, you’ll be disappointed. This isn’t an intriguing tale of nefarious
  corporate collusion, or even one of lacklustre fund managers. The companies held
  by these funds, especially the larger positions, are simply some of the most high
  quality companies in Australia. These are world-class companies. The fund managers
  are right to hold them. These positions aren’t risky bets on companies from disparate
  sectors. They’re simply the best representation of the Australian economy.\n\nThis
  isn't a story about holdings, but one about fees. The question is why should you
  continue to pay a fund manager for ideas that have been public knowledge for years?\n\nThese
  ideas can be easily replicated using a DIY strategy, an [mFund](/blog/asx-mfund-now-available-on-sharesight/)
  (which will hopefully be cheaper), or via an ETF. The Vanguard Australian Share
  ETF (ticker: VAS) that we used for benchmarking above charges 0.15% per annum. \n\nAssuming
  you can get an 8% annual return from an Aussie share strategy, you’re giving up
  2% of your return versus 25% using a traditional managed fund. And the only sure
  thing in investing are the fees you pay.\n\n<small><sup>1</sup>This data is available
  from the fund companies' websites.</small>\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Blog -- [How

  So why would investors continue to pay expensive management fees?
