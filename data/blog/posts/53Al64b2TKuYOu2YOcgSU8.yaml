:title: Morningstar Individual Investor Conference highlights
:content: "The team at [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com) had the privilege
  of attending the Morningstar Individual Investor Conference in Sydney this week.\n\nThe
  event offered investors an opportunity to gain expert insights and practical knowledge
  to help rise above the uncertainty in today's short-term world, and I've captured
  the key highlights and learnings from the event for the Sharesight audience.\n\n##
  The rise of ETF investing - opening remarks\n\nThe welcome and introduction was
  led by Jamie Wickham, MD of Morningstar Australia. He set the context and backdrop
  of the key themes influencing global markets. In particular, the key themes identified
  were:\n\n* Donald Trump's domestic policies in the USA (tax changes)\n* The US-China
  trade-war \n* The influence of bond yields on the price of every other asset class\n*
  Market expectations of 4 more interest rate increases from the US Federal Reserve
  in 2019\n* The opportunity and risk presented by ETFs when the market *does* start
  to correct -- as 45% of on-exchange investments in the USA are now passive in nature\n\n##
  Global investing in turbulent geo-political times -- keynote address\n\nThe keynote
  address topic was on global investing in turbulent geo-political times. It took
  the form of a panel discussion with fund managers across a range of asset classes,
  including equities and fixed income across the globe. The panel discussion featured
  Vihari Ross, Global Portfolio Manager at Magellan, Peter Bull, Head of Equities
  at Morningstar and Jay Sivapalan, Co-Head of Australian Fixed Interest from Janus
  Henderson. It was moderated by Emma Wall, Senior Editor from Morningstar. \n\nThe
  key takeaway for investors from the discussion was: stick to boring high-quality
  investments at a good price.\n\n![morningstar individual investor conference](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/58njfP4NvWuYKs40IAyKgA/b99c53fcc4da2b07927aca7f26d69461/morningstar_individual_investor_conference.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  The outlook for Australian shares\n\nPeter Warnes, the Head of Equity Research at
  Morningstar Australia gave his perspective on the outlook for Australian shares.\n\nHe
  identified the three trends driving share prices:\n\n1. Supply and demand for equities\n2.
  Share buybacks and corporate debt (particularly in US markets)\n3. Passive ETFs
  increasing the risk of highly correlated investments\n\nComing to the Australian
  economy, he highlighted the importance of consumption in contribution to GDP growth
  in Australia. 60% of GDP growth in Australia is driven by consumption. Consumption
  is under threat from the lack of savings in households and limits on the ability
  to fuel consumption through debt.\n\n![Household income consumption](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4fS3XgyKpqyQwogWGGw8MK/0948b723a5dcffe08d9093809e01a7fb/Household_income_consumption.jpg?w=950)\n\nThe
  key takeaway from this for investors is that a world of increased debt and decreased
  savings is likely to drive lower returns for all, so we need to lower our expectations
  for risk adjusted return on equity.\n\n## The art and science of valuing stocks\n\n[Adam
  Fleck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-fleck-cfa-0393555/?originalSubdomain=au),
  Director of Equity Research at Morningstar, took us through a masterclass on \"*The
  art and science of valuing stocks*\".\n\nIt was a comprehensive talk covering fundamental
  concepts and how he evaluates companies. The overarching philosophy of Morningstar
  is \"We believe that a company's intrinsic worth results from the future cash flows
  it can generate\".\n\nHe walked us through an example of the A2 milk company, which
  frequently figures in our [#Sharesight20ASX](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharesight20asx)
  and [#Sharesight20NZX](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharesight20NZX) lists as the
  most traded company among our client base. He took us through an analysis framework
  that looks at a company's revenue, EBIT margin trend, discounted cash flow and key
  driver assumptions to derive a company's fair value.\n\n## Managed funds, ETFs and
  LICs: What it takes to win Morningstar gold\n\nMatt Wilkinson covered one of my
  favourite topics of the day: \"*Managed funds, ETFs and LICs: What it takes to win
  Morningstar gold*\". At Sharesight we [track all 3 of these instruments](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)
  that help diversify a portfolio.\n\n![Managed investment structures](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Et9wlRgk8gMYmmuAKowKI/c3a3dabc5b01a09fbd3aaf6947ba7bbe/Managed_investment_structures.jpg?w=950)\n\nThe
  key takeaways on how to trade ETFs, [ETMFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-managed-fund-etmf.asp)
  and LICs:\n\n* Check market depth and the spread\n* Use limit orders wherever possible\n*
  Global products are most prone to wide spreads\n* Be most cautious of the mornings
  and volatile markets\n\n## 20 lessons from 20 years of investing\n\nAnton Tagliaferro
  and Daniel Moore from Investors Mutual Ltd gave a humorous and educational talk
  on 20 lessons from 20 years of investing.\n\nSomething new I learnt from the presentation
  was to \"play close attention to de-mergers\" as they result in better yields more
  often than not. They presented data on how demergers (such as the [Wesfarmers/Coles
  demerger](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/wesfarmers-coles-demerger-details/)) perform
  better than IPOs.\n\n## Global equities\n\nAndrew Clifford, CEO of Platinum gave
  an keynote address on Global equities. Under the current backdrop of geopolitical
  tensions, his 3 major investor concerns are:\n\n1. Chinese reforms, financial tightening
  and potential economic slowdown\n\n2. Rising US interest rates\n\n3. President Trump's
  trade war\n\nHe presented a framework on how to analyse and find opportunities based
  on market sentiment and facts. \n\n![framework for stock analysis](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6uAHFQXszYKmc6E4WmGI2s/2f692ebd07c3e04274c02f416b680dd2/framework_for_stock_analysis.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
