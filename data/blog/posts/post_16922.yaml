:title: Sharesight at Xerocon Sydney Elevate Conference | 28-30 August 2013

  One of the best parts about running a cloud-based business is scalability and low barriers to entry. What was once super-expensive is now affordable. I don’t even want to know what renting server space cost in the 1990s. The same holds true for marketing. We achieve great response rates through social media, email, and blogging.

  Sometimes, though, it’s hard to beat good old fashioned face to face communication. Which is exactly why we’re excited to be exhibiting at Xero’s conference this week, Xerocon Sydney Elevate. We find the cloud-converts an enthusiastic bunch, especially those on the [Xero](/xero/) platform so we’ve found Xerocon to be a great networking and idea-generating event.

  [Sharesight](/) will be hosting a booth on the expo floor (booth 40 if you’re attending), from which we’ll be running demos all day, Thursday and Friday. We’ll be hosting a break-out session at 3:30PM on Thursday in room 6A where we’ll explain the problems we solve for accountants and demo our automated Xero interaction. Last, but not least, we’ll have a photobooth competition during networking drinks on Wednesday night and be giving out prizes, including a GoPro camera.

  We’re looking forward meeting our accounting clients in person, learning about apps, which make accounting practices more efficient, and of course to working with our friends at Xero. They certainly know their way around a marketing plan so we can’t wait to see what they have in store. If you’re attending, please stop by and say hello to Sharesight. In case you’re wondering, it’s not too late to [sign up](https://www.xero.com).

  We’ll post a recap blog next week...
