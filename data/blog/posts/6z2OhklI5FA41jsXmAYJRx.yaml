:content: "There has been a surge in interest in Special-Purpose Acquisition Companies
  or SPACs in 2020 as a structure for companies to raise capital instead of via an
  IPO. This has partly resulted from [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/2020-is-the-year-of-the-spac/)
  and associated business disruption. However, this is a complex investment strategy
  and it’s important for investors to understand the key differences to an IPO and
  the potential pitfalls of investing through a SPAC.\n\n![SPACs](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/EGpP9NvNcKvpUizxgyYqH/094592050862bee1b2bba0e4d3d39f0a/SPACs.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a SPAC?\n\nA SPAC is a corporation formed for the sole purpose of raising
  investment capital through an IPO. In this respect, it is little more than an alternative
  way for a company to go public. But because a SPAC is a shell or [‘black cheque’
  company](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/blank-check-company.asp) it
  does no formal business and exists only to raise capital and ultimately acquire
  a private company. The acquired company becomes public as part of the IPO and can
  then be traded like normal shares. While SPACs have been around for decades, it
  is only in recent years that they've \"gone mainstream\" and come to the attention
  of sophisticated retail investors.\n\n## What is the purpose of setting up a SPAC?\n\nIt
  can be an efficient way for companies to go public very quickly and potentially
  offers more certainty than an IPO. While an IPO means negotiating with multiple
  institutional investors and uncertainty around the valuation until close to the
  offering, with a SPAC the IPO is already done and there are just two parties — the
  SPAC and the company being acquired — negotiating the deal. This means SPACs are
  far less susceptible to the vagaries of markets, which can be a strong positive
  in the face of Covid-19 business disruption and volatility in global markets. It
  is worth remembering that many companies will have raised tens, if not hundreds,
  of millions of dollars in venture capital [only to see their IPO plans derailed](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/)
  or slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic and a SPAC may now be a good alternative. And
  from the investor's standpoint, it's an opportunity to consider investing in an
  exciting new public company at a time when there haven't been as many IPOs in the
  market. \n\n## How do SPACs go public?\n\nSPACs are generally formed by experienced,
  well-connected executives who are confident that their reputation will help them
  identify a profitable company to acquire. With the identity of the target (or targets)
  still unknown, investors have little to go on but the track record of the SPAC founders.
  This process has evolved over the years as previously institutional investors were
  able to vote on the company the SPAC settled on buying. Regulators have since separated
  the right to vote and the right to redeem one’s shares. As such, today’s investors
  can redeem their capital, making the voting process more perfunctory and enabling
  most deals to go through as planned. When the SPAC raises the required funds through
  an IPO, [the money is held in a trust](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/audit-assurance/accounting-advisory/spac-merger.html)
  until a predetermined period deadline is reached or the desired acquisition is made
  or partnership reached.\n\n## Acquiring the target company or de-SPACing\n\nAfter
  the SPAC has raised the required capital through an IPO, the management team has
  18 to 24 months to [identify a target and complete the acquisition](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/special-purpose-acquisition-company-spac/)
  or merger. This is typically based on an investment thematic focused on a particular
  sector or geography and / or the experience and backgrounds of the founders. Identifying
  and completing a merger with a target company is sometimes referred to as de-SPACing.
  The fair market value of the target company must be 80% or more of the SPAC’s trust
  assets. Once acquired, both the founders and investors will receive an equity interest
  according to their capital contribution. If the timeframe lapses before an acquisition
  is completed, then the SPAC is dissolved, and the IPO proceeds are returned to investors.
  \n\n## How are SPACs different from an IPO in launching a public company?\n\nThe
  SPAC approach offers several distinct [advantages over a traditional IPO](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/07/06/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-an-introduction/),
  especially when market volatility and other conditions limit liquidity, as well
  as potentially lowering transaction fees and speeding up the process of creating
  a public company. However, the merger of a SPAC with a target or partner company
  can present several challenges. These mostly come from trying to produce a public
  company to an accelerated timeline while complying with complex accounting and financial
  reporting/registration requirements. The target company’s management team will need
  to focus on being ready to operate as a public company within three to five months
  of signing a letter of intent.\n\n## Risks of investing in SPACs\n\nInvestors may
  be wary of buying shares of a company that went public through a SPAC because the
  amount of due diligence scrutiny required for a merger is less than for a regular
  IPO. This may be an issue if the SPAC founders feel pressured to [do a deal at an
  unrealistically high price](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-assess-the-risks-before-you-invest-in-a-spac-11602261758)
  or for a substandard asset. Even if investors scupper the deal and the SPAC returns
  their capital, it still means the investors’ money has been tied up for almost two
  years with no upside. Most retail investors are simply not equipped or qualified
  to assess the valuation of a SPAC’s target company if it has no operating history,
  revenue or cash flow. In the case of start-up ventures, investors may be voting
  to approve a transaction based on future growth projections or unproven strategies.
  These are often decisions best left to venture capital and private-equity firms.\n\n##
