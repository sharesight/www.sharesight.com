  ## Background on the Domain - Fairfax Demerger

  Fairfax Media Limited is a 186 year old business, with interests across print, online media, radio and streaming video services across both Australia and New Zealand, with a [claimed reach](http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20171102/pdf/43nxb6nwz2yw81.pdf) of 70% of Australians and 90% of New Zealanders.

  Fairfax Chairman Nick Falloon, describes Domain as “A real estate and technology services business, offering services across digital and print platforms.”

  The Domain business emerged within Fairfax as a dominant player (alongside [REA Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REA_Group)) in the online real estate advertising space in Australia, riding the nation’s prolonged ‘boom’ in property prices and the shift from real estate print advertising in newspapers towards an online marketplace model.

  Fairfax’s publishing businesses has seen declining revenues for some time, owing to the shift in consumer preferences from print to online media, which has impacted advertising revenues for the business, with the pre-tax cash flow of Fairfax (excluding Domain) half what it was [three years ago](https://www.clime.com.au/investing-report-archive/fairfax/).

  Domain on the other hand, has tripled pre tax cash flow over the same period and separating this business is seen by the Fairfax board as providing additional flexibility for both businesses, which is argued, will maximise shareholder value.
