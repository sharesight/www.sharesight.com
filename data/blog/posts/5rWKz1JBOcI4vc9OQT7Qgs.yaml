:content: "There are many styles of investing depending on the thesis of the investor.
  Some common investing styles are growth, value, dividend, and dividend growth, for
  example. In this post, we’ll go into a bit more detail on dividend investing and
  the 6 key metrics dividend investors need to track to be successful.\n\n![Key metrics
  for dividend investors2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7IKpNsNi6qHwX2bgU9ZV8l/89a82a76efaff41eb250490bdcb546ba/Key_metrics_for_dividend_investors2.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is dividend investing?\n\nDividend investing strategies aim to generate a steady
  stream of income through dividend payouts with only a secondary focus on capturing
  capital growth through appreciation in stock prices or unit prices in the case of
  mutual funds and ETFs. This is an attractive investment strategy, particularly for
  long-term investors, and for those who want to balance the risk in terms of the
  vagaries of the equities markets, with the necessities of generating an income stream.\n\n##
  Challenges of dividend investing\n\nThe biggest challenge of being a dividend investor
  is keeping track of paperwork. From dividend announcements to corporate actions
  that occur during reporting season, all that paperwork quickly becomes a task of
  its own. \n\nSecondly, [stock or unit prices usually drop after the ex-dividend
  date](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/ex-dividend-dates-and-their-impact-on-stock-prices-explained/#)
  because the valuation of the underlying company or portfolio of companies in the
  case of a fund will decrease when dividends are paid out. This would result in a
  negative outcome for capital growth and will be reflected in the portfolio section
  of their online broker.\n\nThirdly, the investor has to check the [share registry
  or the stock transfer agent](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-stock-transfer-agent/)
  for the amount declared and paid. The investor then has to cross verify with the
  bank account nominated to receive these dividend payouts.\n\nThe result of these
  challenges is that many dividend investors try to track all of this data in a custom
  spreadsheet. Keeping track of data between the broker and the share registry or
  stock transfer agent becomes tedious. Inaccuracies or incomplete data creep into
  the spreadsheet, and with every passing year, the only thing assured is more time
  spent gathering data and maintaining the spreadsheet.\n\n## The 6 key metrics of
  dividend investing\n\nBy the very nature of dividend investing, it is often considered
  ‘set and forget’; you build a basket of reliable dividend earners, then sit back
  and enjoy the income stream that it generates. However, it’s important to at the
  very least keep track of some key metrics as guardrails for your portfolio. The
  following should be part of any dividend investor’s toolkit:\n\n### 1. Dividend
  yield\n\nSimply put, this is the ratio of dividends to stock price. This metric
  simply tells you how much regular income you might get from the stocks you own.
  Dividend yield can be calculated with the following formula: *Dividend yield = annual
  dividend per share/current stock price*\n\nFor example, a company that pays a dividend
  of $5 annually with a current share price of $100 has a dividend yield of 5%. \n\nUsing
  Sharesight to look at the dividends to stock price movements for BHP, we calculate
  the dividend yield by adding up the two dividend payouts and dividing by the current
  share price. In this case that would be: $0.7545 + $1.311 = $2.0655. The current
  share price at the time of writing this blog post was $44.95. The ratio of these
  two numbers is 4.6%. By the very nature of the definition, the current share price
  can affect a stock’s dividend yield. If we had measured the same metric before the
  fall in stock price, the dividend yield would have been 3.9%.\n\n![Sharesight holding
  dividends1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2S83PmxZuGxJkCAS0CAQ2O/cc6b5bc0a1cf0a0d81099e8cc020638d/Sharesight_holding_dividends1.png?w=950)\n\nDividend
  yield in isolation is not a very useful metric. Dividend yields can increase if
  either the dividend payout increases or if the stock price decreases. If the stock
  price decrease is due to a fundamental issue with the underlying business, then
  you are buying into an underperforming company. Hence, the term [dividend yield
  trap](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-a-dividend-yield-trap/).\n\n### 2.
  Dividend payout ratio\n\nThis metric measures how much of a company’s earnings (net
  income) are paid out as a dividend. If this number is too high, it means there is
  not much room for error in case of a downturn. If it's too low (like 0%), then it's
  not a dividend stock.\n\nThe dividend payout ratio can be calculated with the following
  formula: *Dividend payout ratio = total dividends/income*\n\nBoth the total dividends
  and the net income of the company will be reported on the financial statements at
  the time of releasing earnings by the company. [The dividend payout ratio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-the-dividend-payout-ratio-dpr/)
  on a share basis is the ratio of the dividends per share by the earnings per share.
  For example, if a company’s total profits were $100,000, and its dividend is $25,000,
  then the dividend payout ratio would be 25%.\n\nUnlike the dividend yield above,
  the dividend payout ratio is not influenced by the current stock price.\n\n### 3.
  Monthly dividend income\n\nIf you’re a dividend income or dividend growth investor,
  tracking the value of dividends from your investments over time is essential, particularly
  if you rely on dividend income to fund your lifestyle. If you track your dividends
  properly, you will have a clear view of how much income your dividend stocks generate.\n\nTo
  view the monthly income from your portfolio, the first step for any dividend investor
  is to get all their investments into Sharesight, including any [investment property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and fixed income securities. Using the [Future income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-monthly-dividend-income-from-your-investments/)
  report, you can then change the date filter to see the [monthly total dividend,
  distribution, and any fixed income you have received](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-monthly-dividend-income-from-your-investments/).
  \n\nThe monthly income looks like this:\n\n![Sharesight dividends upcoming payments2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3ZVF5MxgCZOwiRzNB3pwlV/e7bbc106a691aaff5b50d385cad60eb9/Sharesight_dividends_upcoming_payments2.png?w=950)\n<small>
  With the Future Income Report, upcoming dividend income is broken down into a range
  of categories to help investors plan their cashflow. </small>\n\n### 4. Cost base
  of DRPs/DRIPs\n\nDividend reinvestment plans (DRPs or Drips) are a great way to
  increase exposure to a stock by automatically reinvesting dividends in new shares
  or units (in case of ETFs or mutual funds) instead of receiving cash. While it’s
  really advantageous to grow holdings in a company or a fund without having to pay
  any further brokerage, it does present a record-keeping challenge.\n\nSharesight
  helps [keep track of DRPs/DRIPs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  in an automated manner that reduces the work investors need to put in. For example,
  as seen in the screenshot below, the cost base for every dividend reinvestment is
  automatically tracked, helping the investor make accurate tax filing records and
  decisions.\n\n![Sharesight dividends All trades3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/33iahjkKb2Hpi1aYBWn1xm/2703ed7ef96b5aaeafdef224eca1f031/Sharesight_dividends_All_trades3.png?w=950)\n\n###
  5. Franking credits\n\nThis is a bonus one for jurisdictions that have dividend
  imputation tax credits, also known as franking credits (particularly in Australia).
  For the individual investor, this franking credit entitles the investor to receive
  a credit for the tax already paid by the company on this dividend against their
  income when they complete their tax return. In cases where the tax already paid
  exceeds the individual’s marginal tax rate, the tax office will refund the difference
  in cash (under current rules).\n\nIt’s easy to [track franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-calculate-franking-credits-on-your-investment-portfolio/)
  with Sharesight. For example, Telstra’s dividends are 100% franked. Telstra shareholders’
  dividend distribution looks something like the example below in Sharesight:\n\n![Sharesight
  dividends All income4](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7KgzYHsk8GQHBMVRZMtD6n/f89372f7dde46404ad3c27627b061fa7/Sharesight_dividends_All_income4.png?w=950)\n<small>
  Sharesight gives investors a clear breakdown of their dividend income, including
  franked dividends. </small>\n\n### 6. Total annualised return\n\nWhile this is not
  a pure dividend metric, it’s an important and comprehensive one that tracks the
  overall performance and health of the portfolio. As you can see from the key drivers
  of total annualised return, dividend return is just one of the components.\n\nThe
  main components that go into an annualised return are:\n\n* Capital gains\n\n* Dividends
  & distributions\n\n* Currency fluctuations\n\n* Brokerage costs\n\n* Time\n\nThe
  way they come together is represented by the table from Sharesight below. By [breaking
  the annualised return down](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  into these components, it gives investors a clear view of which factors are contributing
  the most to their return, allowing investors to make more informed decisions about
  their portfolio. \n\n![Sharesight annualised return5](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1m3yVs73Wq7nXzR0FiBuVz/1b86c5c1fab899f26ae1052d07dcaefa/Sharesight_annualised_return5.png?w=950)\n\n##
