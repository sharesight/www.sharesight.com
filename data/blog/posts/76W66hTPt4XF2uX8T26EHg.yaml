:title: Sharesight release notes - March 2019
:content: "Our focus in March has been geared toward our [Interactive Brokers integration](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/add_interactive_brokers).
  We are only a week or so away from opening the feature up to enthusiastic early
  adopters. Our [beta](https://help.sharesight.com/beta/) users will hear more from
  us in the next couple of weeks regarding this integration.\n\nHere’s what else we’ve
  been up to in March:\n\n![Sharesight Release Notes March 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3mDEpcvz0DGqJbo7TzLTn8/995d5442ad7d0cdf006a1cb09c2d0cda/Sharesight_Release_Notes_March_2019.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Country currency coverage\n\n* Foreign exchange (forex) rates and support for 40
  additional currencies added to the [32 we already support](/blog/track-foreign-currency-on-sharesight/)
  (plus [8 cryptocurrencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/))
  \n\n## Usability\n\n* Introduced the ability for any of our users to add themselves
  to the [Sharesight beta](https://help.sharesight.com/beta/) program via the My Details
  page\n\n* Improved functionality regarding total claimable foreign tax paid on the
  [Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/new_fdr_report_page/)
  for New Zealand users. We now segment any FIF tax paid by their respective holdings
  and calculate a maximum claimable foreign tax paid per holding\n\n* Introduced a
  minor layout change to the criteria selection on the [Portfolio Overview](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/)
  and [Individual Holding](https://help.sharesight.com/show_holding/) pages in preparation
  for some final overview changes coming in April\n\n* Gmail users can set their [Trade
  Confirmation Emails import](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) address
  as a forwarding address within their Gmail client now and verify that forwarding
  address from within the [Trade Confirmation Emails Inbox](https://help.sharesight.com/viewing-the-contract-notes-inbox/)\n\n*
  Enhancements to the manual [Cash Account](https://help.sharesight.com/creating-a-cash-account/)
  trade syncing through improved handling of unsettled trades adjustment feature and
  DRP trades \n\n* Improvements to the new trade form, particularly in regard to the
  instrument search, better handling of errors and the introduction of a new exchange
  rate search function\n\n* Improvements to the trade notification process for those
  using the [Sharesight Connect API](https://help.sharesight.com/sharesight_connect/)\n\n*
  Fixes and improved support for 20+ [contract notes](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)\n\n*
  Made some additional IE11 improvements following on from last month’s effort\n\n*
  Added new [broker support](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/) for Charles
  Stanley, Pac Partners, Craigs, Investorfirst Securities\n\n* Introduced the ability
  for users to set a financial year end day instead of just the month (to cater specifically
  to our UK users)\n\n* Enabled handling of fractional quantities on almost all remaining
  markets, including the NZX and ASX to allow for investments through micro-investing
  platforms such as Sharesies \n\n* Enabled the storing of criteria selection on our
  [mobile app](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-mobile-app--april-2017-update/)
  after logging out\n\n* Introduced a new [Sharesight20](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20/)
  page to feature all our Sharesight20 top 20 trades snapshots \n\n## Sharesight API\n\n*
  API V3 (in beta): Added an endpoint to return a trade log of all interactive broker
  trades\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- [Sharesight release notes - January 2019](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-release-notes--january-2019/)\n-
