:title: The improved Sharesight interface. New body. Same engine.
:url_slug: the-improved-sharesight-interface-new-body-same-engine
:content: "As we've blogged before, the development of [Sharesight](/) features is
  based on the feedback we receive from you. Along with adding more types of investments,
  benchmarking, and mobile/tablet capability, making Sharesight even more user-friendly
  is critically important. People love using our product because it's intuitive. Investment
  portfolios are serious business, but that doesn't mean the software we use to track
  them can't evolve rapidly and look and feel like the apps we use for news, travel,
  or social media. So as more and more functionality gets added to Sharesight, _keeping_
  our product user-friendly, whilst surfacing new capabilities is something we need
  to plan carefully.\n\nThe bedrock for this future plan will be released this week,
  as we roll out **our brand new user interface**. If you're a beta user or elected
  to get a sneak peak, you've probably already seen the new look Sharesight. Not only
  is this a more elegant design, but our Product Manager and developers are happy
  because they can release new user-facing functionality rapidly.\n\n![New Sharesight
  Interface](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3OdjZhjV7iW6sSWe6wsY26/df94628e35218a8d901d9a34a53e6984/newui.png?w=950)\n<small>*Hello,
  is it me you're looking for?*</small>\n\n### Refreshed, Crisp Design\n\nThe first
  thing you're likely to notice is the new interface uses more real estate than the
  old version. This is by design. If you resize your browser, you'll notice Sharesight
  responds accordingly. This is all part of maximising the amount of information you
  can view, based on your browser or device. We've also changed our fonts, text size,
  and generally added more spacing to our pages and tables. This has all been done
  to improve readability and increase the amount of information we can display at
  one time.\n\n### Tablet Compatibility, Responsive Design, Mobiles\n\nAfter PC-based
  browsers, a huge portion of our user base logs into Sharesight on their iPads or
  tablets. Sharesight has been rebuilt using [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design),
  which **works beautifully on all tablets**. Go ahead and give it a try. Not only
  will the pages render smartly, but so will the menus and overlays, even when you're
  in landscape mode. \n\nSharesight will now work more effectively on mobiles (browsers),
  although depending on the size of your screen, it won't be 100% optimised. We've
  heard your feedback about developing a mobile app, so we will. We've gathered some
  excellent feedback already on what you'd expect in a Sharesight app versus going
  to Sharesight on your mobile browser.\n\n### Better Charting\nOn the Portfolio Overview
  page and the individual holding pages, you'll notice larger, more usable charts.
  Again, the focus is on displaying more data, whilst making it simpler to comprehend.
  If you find the charts too large, you can elect to hide them on the Overview page.
  If you're thinking, \"why the hell are they taking up so much space with those charts,\"
  there's a reason: benchmarking. One of the most common feature requests we receive
  is to add benchmarking. We'll soon have a project underway to allow for basic index
  [benchmarking](/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/), but we plan on exploring
  [contribution analysis](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/) (i.e.
  which holdings contributed/detracted what amount from my portfolio), and benchmarking/modelling
  against your other portfolios. \n\n### Overlays\nIn the past, in order to edit a
  trade or dividend, Sharesight loaded an entirely new page, where you did your work,
  and then reloaded again to take you back to where you were. That was a waste of
  your time. So, we've built overlays to allow you to quickly edit trades and dividends.
  \n\n![Overlay](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3oKXsKyQQ0SSmI8wmIsQMy/8da006195afafaf576e6c03c7f965fff/overlay1.png?w=950)\n<small>*Don't
  call me a popup. I'm an overlay.*</small>\n\nYou'll find many more design improvements
  throughout the app, especially in the menu tabs and account settings pages. A couple
  of our favourites are the top level portfolio value and return data on the [Portfolio
  Overview page](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/) and the lightning bolt
  icons for automatically populated dividends and corporate actions.\n\n**We're already
  gathering feedback on our new UI, and listening for more. Get in touch via our [community
  forum](https://community.sharesight.com) or social media channels!**\n\n### FURTHER
