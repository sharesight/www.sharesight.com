:title: 2017 stock picking competition - survey results
:content: |-
  In our [2017 stock picking competition](/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition/) survey we posed a series of questions to gauge Australian and Kiwi investor sentiment heading into the new year in addition to gathering the stock picks. For various reasons people were ready for 2016 to come to a close, but global stock markets actually performed quite well.

  Using [Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF](https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/investments/productoverview?fundId=3141) (NYSE: VT) as a benchmark, which tracks 3,750 stocks from 45 countries, global markets returned just over 14% for the 2016 calendar year, with an additional 2.56% in dividend income.

  Investors worldwide fixated on the unprecedented US election in November, but since then global markets are up more than 7%.

  **So how do Aussie and Kiwi Sharesight customers feel about the next 12 months?**
