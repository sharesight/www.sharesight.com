:title: What is a capital dividend?
:url_slug: what-is-a-capital-dividend
:content: "A capital dividend is a dividend paid out of a company’s base shareholder
  equity. This differs from a regular dividend, which is paid out of profits that
  have been earned on top of shareholders’ equity. Generally, companies will only
  elect to pay a capital dividend if they haven’t made the profits necessary to issue
  regular dividends. For this reason, capital dividends are often considered a sign
  of poor financial health.\n\n![What is a capital dividend](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/70Z6xaHvdWRsiZImGDJ15j/df0e65762ce0979e09c347d27e57cdde/What_is_a_capital_dividend.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How do capital dividends work?\n\nCapital dividends essentially return a portion
  of shareholders’ initial investments in lieu of sharing profits. Consider the following
  hypothetical example:\n\nNeutronics, a technology company, has base shareholder
  equity of $500 million and pays dividends semi-annually. Under normal circumstances,
  these dividends are paid out of the company’s profits.\n\nAfter a difficult few
  months, however, Neutronics fails to generate the profits necessary for scheduled
  dividends. Instead they must resort to capital dividends by dipping into their base
  equity and paying back shareholders part of their initial investment in the company.
  In doing so, they appease shareholders in the short term, but chip into their own
  operating capital. Neutronics hopes it will recover a positive financial position
  in the next quarter to cover the loss.\n\nWhile this arrangement allows companies
  to deliver a dividend even if they are performing poorly, it also cuts into their
  capital base; the pool of shareholder equity that should ideally go toward new business
  opportunities and growth. Unsurprisingly, this often causes investors to lose confidence.
  \n\n## What are the advantages of capital dividends?\n\nCapital dividends give investors
  a second chance to secure a dividend from a company that isn’t making substantial
  profits. In this sense, it might be considered something of a safety net. \n\nThere
  are also tax benefits to capital dividends in the US. In the eyes of the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc404),
  they are viewed as a ‘return of capital’ or refund on the initial stock price. Not
  only does this mean they’re tax exempt, but it also means that they can be used
  to justify lowering the original stock price when you file it on your tax return.
  \n\n## What are the disadvantages of capital dividends?\n\nFor a company in poor
  financial health, issuing capital dividends is not unlike moving water from one
  well to another. It’s a short term way of appeasing investors during tough financial
  times, but it takes a bite out of the very equity needed to sustain and grow the
  company moving forward.  As a result, it’s something of a red flag for most investors.
  \n\nIt’s also important to note that capital dividends will only be issued if the
  company is contractually obliged to pay scheduled dividends to preferred shareholders.
  If the company has no such obligation, it can choose to simply halt dividends altogether
  if it faces financial strain – no need for capital dividends.\n\n## Looking for
  an easy way to track return of capital? \n\nWhen you’re tracking investments across
  different asset classes, markets, currencies and brokers, even the most careful
  spreadsheet starts to crack under pressure. With Sharesight, you can automatically
