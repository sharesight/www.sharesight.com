:title: Announcing the Merge Holding feature
:content: "[Sharesight](/) handles the vast majority of corporate actions -- such
  as dividends and share splits -- automatically. But when two companies merge into
  one (commonly known as a takeover or merger) it can mean a bit of manual portfolio
  admin for investors. To help alleviate that pain, weâ€™re excited to introduce the
  Merge Holding feature:\n \n![featured merge-holding](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/CQ42G1BiMKgSmGq6OIUIW/f8e160cb5a8d0ccd4056a93e685c0d26/featured_merge-holding.png?w=950)\n\n##
  What is the Merge Holding feature and when should I use it?\n\nThe Merge Holding
  feature is designed to record a company merger in the situation where you hold shares
  in a listed company that is wholly acquired by another listed company.\n\nThis feature
  is a simple pop-up that allows you to quickly and accurately record company mergers
  that are otherwise complicated to handle.\n\nPreviously, investors were forced to
  choose between whether they wanted to preserve their performance history, or make
  adjustments to accurately reflect the tax situation created by a merger. This feature
  solves for both. The result is accurate accounting for mergers in terms of your
  tax liability, and means no interruption in your performance history.\n\nThis feature
  assumes 100% [rollover relief](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/takeovers-and-mergers,-scrip-for-scrip-rollover/),
  which commonly applies to mergers involving listed Australian companies. For an
  example of how to handle a merger without rollover relief, see *[How to handle the
  Afterpay and Touchcorp merger](/blog/how-to-handle-the-afterpay-afy-and-touchcorp-tch-merger/)*.\n\nTo
  learn more about the Merge Holding feature, including how to use it within your
  Sharesight portfolio, visit our help page on [Mergers](https://help.sharesight.com/mergers/).\n\n###
