:title: Intraday foreign exchange rates now on Sharesight
:content: "[Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com) clients now have the benefit of
  intraday foreign exchange (forex) prices updated every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day,
  7 days a week. This provides more accurate reporting for international markets,
  [investments in foreign currencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-foreign-currency-on-sharesight/)
  (FX accounts), and [cryptocurrency investments](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/).\n\nWe’re
  using [Open Exchange Rates’ powerful API](https://docs.openexchangerates.org/) to
  bring investors intraday currency prices -- a major upgrade to the daily foreign
  exchange prices previously provided.\n\n![featured sharesight-intraday-foreign-exchange-rates

  More accurate currency reporting in your portfolio\n\nMost investors will notice
  the change when looking at their [Portfolio Overview](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/)
  page and when running [Reports in Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/reports/).
  \n\nSharesight automatically converts the prices and valuations of your holdings
  from their listed market to your portfolio’s base currency. Throughout the day the
  ‘Currency Gain’ value will update to reflect changes in the intra-day foreign exchange
  rates. This will also be reflected whenever you run reports within Sharesight.\n\n##
  Track cryptocurrencies with Sharesight\n\nYou can now track investments in cryptocurrencies,
  including Bitcoin and Ethereum (among others) with values updated every 5 minutes.
  Read [Sharesight’s cryptocurrency tracking feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  announcement for details of the full list of cryptocurrencies we now tracks.\n\n##
  Track foreign exchange holdings in Sharesight\n\nEagle-eyed Sharesight clients may
  have spotted this beta feature already, but with foreign exchange rates updated
  every 5 minutes it comes into its own. You can now [track foreign currency holdings](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-foreign-currency-on-sharesight/)
