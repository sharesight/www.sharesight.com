  We’re excited to welcome a new Sharesight Partner, ESUPERFUND and their in-house broker EBROKING!

  This partnership makes sense. ESUPERFUND could have built a portfolio tracker. And we could have built an SMSF administration platform, but why not just offer a free connection between our services?

  [ESUPERFUND](https://www.esuperfund.com.au/) provides self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) for thousands of Australian investors. They take care of compliance obligations, including financial statements, tax returns, and audits. Like [Sharesight](/), their client base is comprised largely of DIY Investors who prefer to make their own investment decisions for their SMSF.

  Since the vast majority of SMSF trustees use their fund as a vehicle for investing in the share market, a seamless connection with Sharesight makes perfect sense. You could argue that portfolio admin is the most important part of running an SMSF!

  Through their in-house broker (EBROKING) ESUPERFUND clients now have a one-click option to send their historical buys, sells, dividends, and corporate actions to Sharesight and we’ll automatically listen for future trades and dividends too. All performance, dividend, and tax reporting can be run on the fly and exported.

  We focus obsessively on making it easy for investors to gain an accurate picture of their portfolio’s performance and to end the reliance of spreadsheets and manual efforts. And in doing so, Sharesight accomplishes exactly what SMSF trustees are required to gather -- thereby bringing the investment administration costs way down.

  We keep an eye on the SMSF space. Ironically, you hear more about the big end of town rushing into this market to capture SMSF trustee assets, whereas the whole point of a self managed super fund is to let individuals take control of their retirement futures. As such we’re proud to partner with the likes of ESUPERFUND who put the investor in the driver’s seat.
