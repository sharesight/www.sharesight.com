:content: |-
  For several years [Sharesight](/) has partnered with the [New Zealand Shareholders Association](http://www.nzshareholders.co.nz/index.cfm), and on Saturday 19, August they’re holding their annual [Investor Conference and AGM ](http://www.nzshareholders.co.nz/shareholders-events.cfm?eid=125)in Wellington.

  This is a terrific opportunity to network with fellow investors and hear from a great lineup of speakers including [Simon Mouter](https://twitter.com/simonmoutter), Managing Director of Spark Ltd and [Mark Peterson](https://au.linkedin.com/in/mark-peterson-366768b4), CEO of the NZX.

  The event is __free__ for members (with a $20 donation) and $50 for the public.

  For 16 years the NZSA has been improving outcomes for New Zealand investors through their growing membership ranks. They aim to improve investor knowledge and risk taking, while also holding company directors to account.

  The theme for this year’s conference is “A World of Change in a Changing World.” Given we’ve been on an 8 year bull market run and seen unprecedented geopolitical events, this topic is perfect given the challenges that investors are facing.

  We at Sharesight encourage all Kiwi investors to attend this event!

  Register for the August 19 event using this link -- [2017 NZSA Investor Conference](http://www.nzshareholders.co.nz/shareholders-events.cfm?eid=125).
