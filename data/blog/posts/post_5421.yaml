:title: Evolving the client-accountant relationship
:url_slug: evolving-the-client-accountant-relationship
:content: "Time and time again, we hear from both our individual and accountant users
  that the topic of fees for administrative services can be a minefield.\n\nClients
  hate surprises in their bill -- that extra hour or two (or five) spent chasing paperwork
  to get the tax return in order can leave a nasty taste in the mouth. And yet the
  clients often create those surprises themselves through lax record-keeping or disorganisation.\n\n[Sharesight](/)
  users know that the service can save them time in gathering paperwork, which can
  then (in turn) save them money on basic bookkeeping fees with their accountant or
  tax agent.\n\nAnd adding a complementary service like [Xero](/xero/), which automates
  your personal budgeting and cashflow management, can also do wonders for keeping
  your bill down at tax time.\n\nBut we’re also starting to hear from users that Sharesight
  is helping them not only save time and money, but actually create a more strategic
  relationship with their accountant.\n\nSharesight clients whose admin and basic
  bookkeeping is taken care of via the cloud are able to redirect resources to the
  value-added services that really make an impact on their financial futures. \n\nServices
  like advice on structuring their affairs, tax minimisation strategies and estate
  planning – which most of the users we speak to would like more of, but many feel
  restricted by the cost.\n\nWe’ve also heard from Sharesight users who are negotiating
  fixed-price agreements with their accountant for tax preparation or SMSF audits
  on the proviso that they will complete the administrative work themselves.\n\nThis
  elimination of those nasty surprises provides the client with certainty about their
  bill, but also allows the accountant to better manage workflow within their practice
  and create efficiency.\n\nCloud technology is enabling both clients and accountants
  to focus on the bigger picture and forge a more productive relationship. Why not
  discuss new ways of working together with your accountant?\n\n### FURTHER READING\n-
