:title: 5 Reasons why buy and hold investors use Sharesight
:content: "Sharesight is useful for all investors because we automate admin, provide
  clarity across how you’ve performed, and produce tax reports. If you’re a buy and
  hold investor, an active trader, or even a professional wealth manager, Sharesight
  has features for you -- [Try Sharesight for free](/pricing/) to find out for yourself.\n\nLong
  term investors buy stocks they believe will provide a good return over time. For
  some, this means investing in a company that shows early promise, but will pay off
  sometime in the distant future, a technology company, for example. Others looks
  towards buying high quality companies today with the belief that they have an [economic
  moat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicmoat.asp) -- a unique competitive
  advantage - for the long haul. Another reason people tend to hold stocks for a long
  period of time is due to their healthy dividend yield.\n\nI’m a long term investor
  myself. If I find a company trading at or near its fair market value, even better.
  This also gives me the opportunity to think like a business owner by following a
  company’s development and taking deep dives into their annual reports.\n\nAll long
  term strategies, however, are equally vulnerable to complacency and disorganisation
  - something that is bound to creep into your investment life if you don’t make a
  commitment to using the right tool for the job. \n\nThe risk of not staying on top
  of your portfolio or acting too late can lead to serious financial mistakes. A successful
  long term investor isn’t a lazy investor. Quite the opposite. \n\n![Buy and Hold
  Bull Market](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3PxtXgn7yEiQY4qMIoegis/8fa09df63b7ac25f406731ad19a96548/Featured-Buy-and-Hold.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Be ready when markets move (and they will!)\n\nWe’ve all enjoyed this nine year
  bull run, but it won’t last forever. When the market does turn, successful long
  term investors are **organised** and ready to take action.\n\n- What is my exposure
  and duration for each investment I own?\n- Have I made or lost money on each position?\n-
  What’s the combined value of my assets across portfolios and accounts?\n- What are
  my tax liabilities if I need to sell?\n\nThe answers to all of these questions are
  available (and up to date) at the click of a mouse for the organised buy and hold
  investor.\n\nYes, Sharesight is a performance and tax platform, but in order to
  do those two things properly, we need your data. So we’re a portfolio admin platform
  too. We’ve put thousands of development hours into making it easy for investors
  to add their data to Sharesight. \n\nThere’s not always a silver bullet solution
  to getting up and running on a new system, but it’s absolutely worth it when the
  value of your investment portfolio (and your next move) is at stake.\n\n## Quantify
  your gains - properly \n\nLong term investors can easily quantify their gains using
  Sharesight. This is essential for deciding whether or not to take money out of the
  market.\n\nThe Sharesight [Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  displays portfolio returns over customisable date ranges and factors in the impact
  of dividends, corporate actions, and foreign currencies on each holding.\n\nImportantly,
  our performance engine uses [annualisation](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/).
  This is critical for investors who’ve held positions for more than one year because
  it normalises returns and makes them comparable to other investments (and areas
  of your life in general).\n\nIf the market does go south, benchmark your portfolio
  to determine how you compare against major world indexes. Dig even deeper with the
  Contribution Analysis Report to determine performance of underlying industries and
  sectors.\n\nExamine your performance as an investor by looking at your portfolio’s
  open positions only or factor your historical sells into your return calculation.\n\n##
  Quantify the impact of potential sells\n\nMost investors have a rough idea of whether
  or not a particular investment has made money, obviously. Many longer term investors,
  however, top up their positions over time or use dollar cost averaging. This creates
  a complex history of buying different amounts of stock at different prices.\n\nThe
  Sharesight [Unrealised Capital Gains Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/unrealised_cgt_report/)
  (Applies to Australia only) will demonstrate the hypothetical impact of sells on
  your portfolio in real time. Plus, it will show you the tax impact of those trades.
  Sharesight automatically captures the date of each trade so it knows if something
  is considered a short term or long term position.\n\n![Unrealised Capital Gains
  Tax Report Australia](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/73t5bK6ely8i0eWg8ISa6i/b43316dc2765d3bcafc67f7142ca635d/UCGT_Report.png?w=950)\n\nIf
  the Performance Report is the historical record of your decisions as an investor,
  then the Unrealised Capital Gains Tax Report is the **potential** record of the
  investment decisions you **could** make.\n\n## Keep an eye on proxies & opportunities\n\nA
  buy and hold investor will be making a large bet on a company and might also be
  systematically investing more over time. This amplifies the risk to their portfolio
  should the company or market move against them.\n\nSmart investors maintain a plan
  B.\n\n[Upgrading to a paid Sharesight plan](/pricing/) allows you to create multiple
  portfolios. Many clients use these to keep tabs on other stocks, indexes, or to
  build watchlists. Since each additional portfolio is fully featured, investors have
  the opportunity to build hypothetical portfolios alongside their real holdings using
  the same values and dates. This provides the ultimate modeling tool for your bear
  market portfolio.\n\n## Track dividend income & future dividends\n\nIf you’re an
  income focussed long term investor, dividend yield makes up a significant portion
  of your overall gain. Sharesight’s inbuilt methodology factors in the impact of
  those dividends, not to mention dividend reinvestment plans (also a pain to track).\n\nSharesight’s
  [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/) will capture
  all dividends paid by the companies you own, including franking credits (Australia)
  and other local components.\n\n![Taxable Income Report Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1M826XZvcAwqIogmgG4uW4/cc19b7ecf3e03314fdea836a58a08df3/Taxable_Income_Report.png?w=950)\n\nDividends
  are paid to both short and long term investors to be sure, but dividend payouts
  are susceptible to company performance and the resulting share price movements.
  Long term investors using Sharesight are able to dig into their history to examine
  the performance of underlying share prices and values with the dividends received.\n\nShould
  a market event cause one of your portfolio companies to slash a dividend, you’ll
  know about it using Sharesight’s [Future Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/)
  which lists expected upcoming dividend and interest payments already announced by
  companies you hold.\n\n## Sharesight, the best platform for buy and hold investors\n\nIf
  you’re a buy and hold investor looking to understand the true performance of your
  investments, track dividends and corporate actions you need a full featured share
  portfolio platform like Sharesight. To stay on top of your portfolio [sign up for
  Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup) today.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
