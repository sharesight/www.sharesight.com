:title: 5 ways to get the most out of Sharesight's Taxable Income Report

:content: "###### Disclaimer: Sharesight does not provide taxation advice and the
  reports do not constitute personal taxation advice. If you have any questions about
  your tax position we recommend you contact your accountant or tax advisor. You remain
  solely responsible for complying with all applicable accounting, tax and other laws.\n\nDesigned
  to help individual investors complete their tax return, Sharesight’s [Taxable Income
  Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/improved-taxable-income-report-for-australian-investors/)
  lists all dividend, distribution and interest payments received during a selected
  period. This makes it a convenient way for investors to keep detailed records of
  the income earned from their investments. The report includes a range of useful
  features for global investors, such as the ability to select custom date ranges,
  split income into different components and edit payouts, as well as some more advanced
  features. \n\n![image 0 taxable income](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1fZ3JmXJ4Qrk1V0OXJa5t8/f0915beddc96e1300c5282d39f6f689e/image_0_taxable_income.jpg?w=950)\n\nTo
  find out more about how Sharesight’s Taxable Income Report helps global investors
  stay on top of their investment income, keep reading. \n\n## 1. Custom date ranges
  \ \n\nThe Taxable Income Report allows investors to view all income for their investments
  over any specified period of time. For example, users may wish to view their income
  over the previous financial year for tax reporting purposes, or over a longer period
  to track their long-term dividend performance. \n\n![taxable income wide](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4mfNzkasOAB5rG5XS7y9dD/97a70742f23c061ab64217039c1455ea/taxable_income_wide.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Users
  can select a period of their choice to assess their investment income.</small>\n\n##
  2. Split income into different components\n\nThe report splits investment income
  into Local Income and Foreign Income. This is done to mimic tax reporting, where
  (depending on the country) these income categories can be taxed at different rates,
  and therefore have different components that need to be recorded. \n\n![image 2

  3. Advanced options\n\n### Show comments\n\nBy enabling this feature you can display
  any comments associated with a payout. For example, if you added comments to flag
  any payouts that need verification with your accountant, these will be visible on
  the Taxable Income Report. If a user has not added any comments to a holding, enabling
  comments will display the company’s dividend price per share, which is the default
  comment on all payouts. Comments will also be visible if you choose to export the
  report into another format such as a spreadsheet. \n\n![image 3 taxable income](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2lKmza4rg2lTapMHBHs3mp/95c7db01d2b19dcd3c458dcade704fb1/image_3_taxable_income.png?w=950)\n\n<small>A
  comment displaying the dividend price per share for an individual payout.</small>\n\n###
  Show holding totals\n\nThis feature provides a more detailed view of your investment
  income by displaying the dividend or distribution values across all payouts during
  the selected period for a single investment. This allows Sharesight users to clearly
  see how each payout has contributed to their income for the investments in their
  portfolio. \n\n![image 4 taxable income](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5kT6DnlmX4Sq9LBLzFdfLX/f45141bf459709845c2421b9b57cb46e/image_4_taxable_income.png?w=950)\n\n<small>An
  example of a holding with quarterly payouts that add up to an annual distribution
  amount of £541.60.</small>\n\n## 4. Edit payouts directly\n\nBy clicking on a payout,
  Sharesight users can directly edit the individual components within that payout.
  Depending on the tax residency of the user, as well as the classification of the
  payout, components may include values such as tax deducted, tax credit, franking
  credits, capital gains tax and foreign tax. If a user finds that any of these components
  are listed incorrectly, it is a quick and easy process to update the values and
  ensure all records are accurate. \n\n![image 5 taxable income](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3jwXonxM6CFfyf63W3lSYz/85d1a5f551087288f122497caf6e97e3/image_5_taxable_income.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Sharesight
  users can easily verify and edit the individual components of payouts in their Taxable
  Income Report.</small>\n\n## 5. Export to a spreadsheet or PDF\n\nAnother handy
  feature of the Taxable Income Report is the ability to [export it to Google Sheets
  or an XLS or PDF file](https://help.sharesight.com/exporting-a-report/). This is
  useful if you want to view the report in another format or share it with your accountant
  for further modifications. \n\n## Sharesight – the perfect tool for global investors
