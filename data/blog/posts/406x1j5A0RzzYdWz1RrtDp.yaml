:title: 3 ways to become a better investor in 2021
:content: "With continued market volatility expected in the year ahead, now is the
  perfect time to consider what you can do to become a better investor while protecting
  your portfolio against turbulent market conditions. Luckily, there are some simple
  measures you can put into place that will give you increased visibility into your
  portfolio’s returns while saving you time and money on your investments. Keep reading
  for three ways to become a better investor in 2021. \n\n![Become a better investor
  v3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/56Znj1lkEkD8Lv9IsXegM8/b9f9a4559d1550b1dd5ca03ed91bc33d/Become_a_better_investor_v3.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Track against market benchmarks\n\nIn times of market volatility, it’s important
  not only to track your investment performance, but to put that performance into
  context with the broader market. One way of doing this is by choosing a benchmark
  for your portfolio that aligns with your investment goals. For example, you may
  choose an ETF or fund that tracks a certain index, or one that tracks a basket of
  stocks in a particular industry that will give you a like-for-like comparison with
  your own portfolio.\n\nWhen benchmarking your portfolio, the idea is that you should
  aim to outperform the benchmark over the year. And if you find you are consistently
  underperforming compared to the benchmark, you may decide to direct your investments
  into the ETF or fund instead, which could be an easy way to earn better returns.
  \n\nIt’s simple to benchmark your portfolio with Sharesight’s portfolio tracker,
  which allows investors to track their portfolio against over [170,000 stocks, ETFs
  and managed/mutual funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)
  from around the world. As can be seen in the screenshot below, while the sample
  portfolio is outperforming its benchmark, it is still clearly following the same
  market trends. In the case of an underperforming portfolio, this is a good way to
  determine whether your portfolio is underperforming due to your own investment decisions,
  or whether it has been caused by broader market events. \n\n![image 1 betterinvestor](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4M91pvVSYm7kuddtm6hwdZ/e1eee778ab38887a2e3432ce9abb409a/image_1_betterinvestor.png?w=950)\n\n<small>

  your portfolio diversity \n\nOne of the best defense mechanisms for any investor
  is to avoid concentration risk by diversifying the assets in your portfolio. This
  could mean shifting your portfolio away from purely individual equities to a balance
  of different asset classes, or expanding your investments into new countries, sectors
  and industries. \n\nWith Sharesight, you can easily determine your asset allocation
  using the [Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  which shows how your portfolio is diversified across different investment types,
  industry and sector classifications, markets and countries. Sharesight users also
  have the option to create their own [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  that align with their specific investment strategy or asset allocation target, which
  makes it easy to track your portfolio against your target and rebalance your assets
  as needed. \n\n![image 2 better investor](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Pesi8it0bk0cVWR0Hkzs8/59c3b6b024328ab54323ca5e41c80b38/image_2_better_investor.png?w=950)\n\n<small>

  [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  will give you a clear picture of how your asset classes are actually performing.
  This will help you evaluate the success of your investment strategy and determine
  whether it needs to be revised in the coming year. \n\n![image 3 better investor](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4KnTtGAbBGeNjzQOWjYkjA/7e0bbd53119c98b3cf993b81db237f0b/image_3_better_investor.png?w=950)\n\n<small>

  Track your dividends\n\nIf you’re invested in stocks, ETFs or managed/mutual funds,
  chances are you receive some dividends or distributions throughout the year. What
  many investors don’t realise is that these payouts directly impact your returns
  and are an important factor to consider when [calculating your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/).
  For this reason, properly [tracking your dividend income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  is one of the best things you can do to become a more informed investor and help
  set your investment goals for the year. \n\nDone manually, tracking dividends can
  be a tedious and time consuming task, requiring you to pull information from various
  paper documents or share registries. It becomes even more complicated if you have
  overseas investments that pay dividends in a foreign currency, which means your
  payments are impacted by the exchange rate.\n\nBy using a dedicated portfolio tracker
  that automatically tracks dividends like Sharesight, it’s easy to calculate dividend
  yield, and visualise the impact of dividends on your portfolio’s returns. For example,
  in the screenshot below you can see that dividends have contributed to 7.53% of
  this holding’s total returns. If you were to disregard the impact of dividends,
  looking only at capital gains, you would think your holding’s total returns were
  only 17.53%, as opposed to 25.25%. This is a big difference, and a key example of
  how knowing your true returns is essential for evaluating your portfolio’s performance
  and setting your investment goals.\n\n![image 4 better investor](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5tOF3MrMfZRCbxqJLHlPKh/8168d107da774df3d13ebafcca1bc5b3/image_4_better_investor.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
