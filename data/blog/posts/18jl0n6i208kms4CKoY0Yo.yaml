:title: How to track employee stock plans
:content: "If you own company shares as part of a bonus plan, also referred to as
  an __employee stock plan (ESP)__ or __employee share scheme (ESS)__, it’s important
  to understand how it works and how to track the performance of these shares. In
  particular, you need to know what your shares are worth, because by the time you
  cash out they may have lost value. \n\n![How to track employee stock plans with
  Sharesight 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3GN6bvn06SjxmtmlkxclOa/3ec207cf87a00c142fb134619c9b6224/How_to_track_employee_stock_plans_with_Sharesight_3.jpg?w=950)\n\nThis
  blog post will explain how stock vesting works, along with the basics behind the
  most common types of employee stock plans, plus why it’s important to track the
  performance of your employee shares and how you can do this with Sharesight.  \n\n##
  What is stock vesting? \n\n**Vesting** is the time lag between when you’re awarded
  the shares and when you can act on them. This is basically a way for the company
  to mitigate short-term behaviour and keep you around. Vesting usually takes place
  on a quarterly or annual schedule with portions of the bonus shares being released
  to you in equal allotments called **tranches**.\n\nThis gets tricky if you’re awarded
  stock bonuses in consecutive years. For example, if you received 35 stock options
  or the RSU cash equivalent (see the section below) in three straight years, with
  the tranches vesting in three equal allotments on a yearly basis this means you’d
  have nine chunks of stock to track:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td> </td>\n    <td>2021</td>\n
  \   <td>2022</td>\n    <td>2023</td>\n    <td>2024</td>\n    <td>2025</td>\n  </tr>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <td>2021 Bonus\n35 Shares</td>\n    <td>Tranche 1 (11 shares)</td>\n
  \   <td>Tranche 2 (12 shares)</td>\n    <td>Tranche 3 (12 shares)</td>\n    <td>
  </td>\n    <td> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2022 Bonus\n35 Shares</td>\n    <td>
  </td>\n    <td>Tranche 1 (11 shares)</td>\n    <td>Tranche 2 (12 shares)</td>\n
  \   <td>Tranche 3 (12 shares)</td>\n    <td> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2023
  Bonus\n35 Shares</td>\n    <td> </td>\n    <td> </td>\n    <td>Tranche 1 (11 shares)</td>\n
  \   <td>Tranche 2 (12 shares)</td>\n    <td>Tranche 3 (12 shares)</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nIn
  this example, 2023 is a busy year. You’d have three chunks of stock vesting at three
  different prices. The unequal amounts are due to 35 not being divisible by three
  in whole share terms.\n\n## What are Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)? \n\n**RSUs**
  are the simplest and most common type of employee stock plan. An RSU is basically
  a cash bonus that is automatically converted into shares. It is pinned to the historical
  grant price and released to you over time via the vesting process mentioned above.
  When the RSUs vest, you’re taxed as if this was normal income. Many employers withhold
  this automatically, particularly in the US, although in countries where employee
  shares are not as widespread this is less common.\n\nFrom a tax perspective, the
  **vesting date** and the **sell date** are the ones to keep an eye on. To avoid
  short-term capital gains tax, you’ll need to hold onto your shares after they vest
  for longer than a year (depending on your tax residency). Also, if your company
  pays dividends, you’ll begin receiving them after vesting and need to factor these
  into your taxable income.\n\n## How do stock options work?\n\n**Stock option plans**
  are out of fashion because they’re a nightmare to administer and create tax problems
  for the recipient, but you may still be a participant. Stock options are shares
  given to an employee at a specific exercise price. They are also generally a lot
  more volatile than ordinary shares.\n\nFor example, Morningstar gave me 35 stock
  options at $18.50 in 2005. This meant I had an option to exercise my 35 shares at
  $18.50 anytime after the vesting date. In my case, all 35 options had vested by
  2009 and I exercised and sold them in 2012.\n\nIt’s commonly misunderstood that
  exercising is the same as selling. Exercising an option means you buy them at the
  agreed price and convert them into shares. You can then choose to hold or sell them.\n\nFrom
  a tax perspective, the clock usually starts running on the **exercise date**. You
  may also be liable to pay income tax on unrealised gains on the shares after exercising
  them as is the case in the US.\n\nOptions usually expire after 10 years as well,
  meaning you forfeit your right to exercise them if you don’t do it before the expiry
  date. This translates to $0. You can see how this can become an expensive and complicated
  process before you receive any cash, and why it’s fallen out of favour!\n\n## Why
  you should track your stock plan with Sharesight\n\nTracking your employee stock
  plan is crucial to make the most out of your shares. Unfortunately, people often
  make the following mistakes: \n\n1. Assuming company stock is the same thing as
  a free cash bonus.\n\n2. Assuming the value of the shares will only go up.\n\nThey
  are not free shares – you’re buying the stock with your bonus. Assuming that you’ve
  bought the shares is the first step towards acting like a proper investor, and this
  means keeping track of your returns (which may not always be increasing). \n\n###
  Adding a stock plan to your Sharesight portfolio\n\nThe first step to tracking your
  shares is confirming how many shares you own, which are vested or unvested, and
  what the grant or exercise price is. Employee share plans are often administered
  by share registries or back office companies, so visiting the relevant website should
  give you the information you need. \n\nNext, if you’re not already using Sharesight
  you can [sign up](https://sharesight.com/signup) for a free account.\n\nOnce you
  have a Sharesight account, simply enter your company shares as buy trades in your
  portfolio. All you need is the **number of units**, **price**, **date**, and you’re
  done. \n\nFor example, here’s how my 35 Morningstar shares would look in a Sharesight
  portfolio, benchmarked against the S&P 500: \n\n![Morningstar stock plan in Australian
  Sharesight portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3a6yOaqLxBae1z9QNqp2xJ/188fcba26b8e869d36fe18d96ba44911/Morningstar_stock_plan_in_Australian_Sharesight_portfolio.PNG)\n<Small>
  An example of stock options from a US company in a non-US portfolio, benchmarked
  against one of more than 170,000 instruments Sharesight supports. </small>\n\nTo
  make things easy, I would recommend using one portfolio for your vested shares and
  another for unvested shares. Then when your unvested shares vest, you would simply
  sell them out of your unvested portfolio and buy them in your vested portfolio (at
  the same price and quantity). Alternatively, you could use Sharesight’s [Custom
  Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  feature to tag vested and unvested shares and keep them in the same portfolio.\n\n###
  Tracking the performance of your employee stock plan\n\nKeeping track of your vested
  shares is important because they will generally be reportable as income in the year
  you \"buy\" them. You can retrieve this data by running Sharesight’s [All Trades
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/trades_report). Your company will also produce
  a report for the tax authorities that details the taxable amount you have received,
  which should equal the sum of your buy trades in most cases. \n\nThe performance
  of your unvested shares is also worth keeping an eye on, especially as the vesting
  date approaches. You have used your bonus to buy these shares, so it’s useful to
  know how they are performing relative to other investments you could have made with
  your bonus. \n\nIt’s easy to evaluate the performance of your company shares with
  Sharesight, as it shows you your [annualised performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/),
  including the impact of capital gains and losses, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and currency fluctuations. You can also benchmark your shares against over 170,000
  different stocks, ETFs and mutual/managed funds [that Sharesight supports](https://help.sharesight.com/au/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  This becomes especially relevant once your shares have vested and you have the option
  to sell and re-invest elsewhere if they aren’t performing well. And should you decide
  to sell your shares, you can simply [share your portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/)
  with your accountant at tax time. \n\n## Track your employee stock plan with Sharesight\n\nNeed
