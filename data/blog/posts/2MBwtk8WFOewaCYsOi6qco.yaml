:title: Ode to the spreadsheet
:content: "Over 70% of investors used a spreadsheet before finding [Sharesight](/).
  In fact, we keep the spreadsheet that served as the Sharesight prototype under lock
  and key in the Sharesight archives:\n\n![screenshot - Tony's spreadsheet](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/44MMFaGO3usYsEiKGUemKO/88d3f16a0463e930832ccb970a3d91ac/screenshot_tony-spreadsheet.png?w=950)\n<small>The
  spreadsheet that started it all -- for more info see <a href=\"/about-sharesight/\"><i>The
  Sharesight Story</i></a>.</small>\n \nWhen we talk to new clients we often find
  ourselves delicately explaining how Sharesight will begin automating what used to
  be done manually in a spreadsheet. Customers sometimes ask if they can download
  our price or dividend data so they can manually do the calculations in their spreadsheet.
  It’s a case of letting go, we tell them.\n \nUnfortunately, we can’t tell people
  what to do with the hours we give them back. It is truly amazing how some people
  don’t put a value on their own time, happy to tinker away on Saturday afternoons
  learning new Excel tricks. I’m guilty of it myself, having recently memorised the
  keyboard shortcut for “Paste Special”. (For other Mac users out there who are curious,
  it’s Command + Control + V.)\n\n![featured - laptop spreadsheet 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/59jPKS6AVO44eeKgUWySCs/cbf12ea9d82c1561da9c2eb331b4c612/featured_laptop-spreadsheet-2.jpg?w=950)\n
  \nOur [spreadsheet upload](https://help.sharesight.com/import-from-csv-file/) feature
  is one of the most popular ways investors get started on Sharesight. With just a
  few required data points, you can [import your historical trades](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/)
  to create your first portfolio, which in turn will automatically calculate your
  performance, capital gains and losses, dividend income, and more. If you don’t have
  your old trades handy, you can [begin with an opening balance](https://help.sharesight.com/upload-import-opening-balances/),
  which is the simplest way to get going.\n \nAnd yes, you can always export your
  portfolio data back into Excel (.csv) if you can’t break the habit.\n \nAgain, I’m
  guilty as charged. Even though we use [Xero](/xero/) for financial reporting I can’t
  resist downloading their profit and loss or cash summary reports into my own models,
  which I’ve been perfecting for years. Truthfully, I rely 100% on Xero to collect
  and process the data, it’s just that I can’t resist having a play with the numbers.\n
  \nSo in honour of underappreciated spreadsheets everywhere, have a listen to this
  recent [Planet Money podcast on the history of spreadsheets](http://pca.st/4M1j)
  and their surprising impact on a number of industries. (If you’re not already subscribed
  to Planet Money, we highly recommend doing so.)\n \nSharesight and spreadsheets:
  frienemies forever.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- [7 reasons why Sharesight is better
