:title: 3 easy ways to automate your portfolio admin
:content: "Investors tend to fall into two camps when it comes to staying on top of
  their [investment portfolios](https://www.sharesight.com/). They either attempt
  to track every minor detail and metric in a complicated spreadsheet – or they don’t
  really bother doing it at all.\n\nDon’t get us wrong – [spreadsheets are awesome](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/ode-to-the-spreadsheet/)
  and certainly serve their purpose. But there are [many reasons](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  why you shouldn’t track your portfolio in a spreadsheet. Alternatively, if you’re
  not actively tracking and engaging with your portfolio, how do you know you’re making
  the most from your investments? \n\nSure, checking your online broker’s reports
  is a good start, but they [often fail](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  to incorporate the impact of things like brokerage fees, currency effects and corporate
  actions when calculating your return and don’t give you the full picture. (Here’s
  a [real-life example](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/why-i-use-sharesight-to-track-my-portfolio/)
  of how an unreported share split made an investor think she was down -47.73%, when
  she was really up nearly 5%.)\n\n![3 easy ways to automate your portfolio admin](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/42Etxbx92jY2BQew3AbiiU/eb28c3fb238ce5a6ebab01055682f305/3_easy_ways_to_automate_your_portfolio_admin.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  See all your investments in one place\n\nLike most things in life, the key to staying
  on top of your investments over the long run is to automate as many of the tedious
  admin tasks that eat up your time as possible. \n\nThe first step in automating
  your portfolio admin should be to [sign-up for a free Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup).
  Import your holdings (either your entire trading history or simply your opening
  balances), then sit back and watch as price and dividend data is updated automatically,
  so you can spend more time tracking your investment performance, and less on tedious
  admin tasks. \n\nOnce your portfolio is set up, you’ll want to automate as many
  of the day-to-day admin tasks as possible. Here are 3 easy ways to do that:\n\n##
  1. Track ongoing trades automatically\n\nKeeping your portfolio up-to-date with
  your latest trades is a crucial step to staying ahead of your portfolio admin, as
  it ensures that your performance figures are accurate and allows you to make timely
  data-driven investing decisions. There are 3 ways to get your new trades into Sharesight:\n\n###
  **Sync your brokerage account via Sharesight Connect**\n\nIf you trade with any
  of the following brokers, then you’re in luck:\n\n* [CMC Markets Stockbroking (AU)](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/cmc/)\n\n*
  [Bendigo Invest Direct (AU)](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/bendigo-bank/)\n\n*
  [Bank of Queensland (AU)](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/boq/)\n\n* [eBroking/eSuperfund
  (AU)](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/esuperfund/)\n\n* [Direct Broking (NZ)](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/direct-broking/)\n\n*
  [Amscot (AU)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-connects-to-amscot-stockbroking-and-state-one/)\n\nThat’s
  because these brokers have partnered with Sharesight to allow their customers to
  automatically sync ongoing trades through the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).
  Here’s how to connect one of those brokerage accounts using [Sharesight Connect](https://help.sharesight.com/sharesight_connect/).
  And for those of you in Canada or the UK, stay tuned for upcoming Sharesight Connect
  broker integrations in your region.\n\n### Connect your brokerage account through
  an integration\n\nIn addition to the Sharesight API, a number of custom integrations
  exist between Sharesight and online brokers that allow you to easily import trades
  to a Sharesight portfolio, including:\n\n* [Saxo Markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-saxo-markets/)\n\n*
  [Interactive Brokers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sync-trades-to-sharesight-from-interactive-brokers/)\n\n![Integrations](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/14YM4Iw9bjCGdCDkBzIRBG/a76b5f168411c2f0a2ccec9cb12d9bb7/Integrations.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Import trades automatically from broker Trade Confirmation Emails\n\nIf your online
  broker provides Trade Confirmation Emails or you can download PDFs from your account
  of these trades, then you can forward those confirmations to Sharesight and we’ll
  automagically \"read\" the trade details from the contents and add the trades to
  your portfolio.\n\nIt’s just a matter of forwarding the emails to us, or including
  Sharesight as a recipient on your trade confirmation emails in your brokerage account.
  Learn more by visiting: *[Import trades via your broker’s trade confirmations](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)*.
  We currently support Trade Confirmation Emails from [100+ online brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  – If your broker's are not yet available in Sharesight, leave a message in our [community
  forum](https://community.sharesight.com/) if you’d like us to add support for your
  broker. \n\n![Brroker Email Import](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7pQrdm9UwYFL9gRBU9Vlji/57e252904f39c45cd9381e567505f329/Brroker_Email_Import.png?w=950)\n\n##
  2. Keep up with corporate actions\n\nSharesight automatically tracks the vast majority
  of corporate actions that occur throughout the year – including dividends and share
  splits. They appear as unconfirmed transactions on the portfolio overview or individual
  holding pages:\n\n![Unconfirmed transactions](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/69FXMJdoaHS4m8AgfzSMN/6f4037853ce84be4614aebb3bd390bcf/Unconfirmed_transactions.png?w=950)\n\nFrom
  the individual holding page, simply click on the unconfirmed transactions icon in
  order to review and confirm the transaction(s):\n\n![Confirm transactions](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4mDOz6Fm8hUmv870Xod44T/423789ab968b43d58b2083358c01ef6c/Confirm_transactions.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  the event of a complex corporate action which requires a decision on your part,
  you’ll need to manually adjust your portfolio according to your particular situation.
  Here’s how:\n\n* If you hold shares in a listed company that is wholly acquired
  by another listed company (with [100% rollover relief](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/shares,-units-and-similar-investments/takeovers-and-mergers,-scrip-for-scrip-rollover/)),
  you can use our new [Merge Holding](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-merge-holding-feature/)
  feature to record the company merger in your portfolio.\n\n* See our collection
  of [major corporate actions](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/corporate-actions/)
  and how to handle them in Sharesight.\n\n* Visit our [corporate actions help documentation](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/)
  for step-by-step instructions on how to handle other corporate actions in Sharesight.\n\nWe
  recommend reviewing your corporate actions on a monthly basis. This ensures the
  accuracy of your performance figures, and depending on the number of holdings in
  your portfolio (and how active they are in terms of corporate actions), it can save
  you a lot of time at the end of the year.\n\n## 3. Track your dividend reinvestment
  plans (DRPs)\n\nSpeaking of dividends, if you’re partaking in a dividend reinvestment
  plan (also known as a DRP or DRIP), it’s especially important to properly track
  its impact on your portfolio. Sharesight makes it easy:\n\n* If you hold shares
  with companies listed on the ASX or NZX and have opted-in to their dividend reinvestment
  plan, then you’ll want to activate Sharesight’s [Auto Dividend Reinvestment feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  for the holding, which will automatically track a DRP by reinvesting all dividends.
  It will even let you automatically [track the residual balances](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-drp-residual-balances/)
  that can occur with some DRPs.\n\n* For shares listed on other markets, you can
  manually record a dividend reinvestment when you [add or edit a dividend payment](https://help.sharesight.com/recording-trades-dividends-and-adjustments/).\n\nEither
  way, when a dividend reinvestment is recorded in Sharesight, a dividend reinvestment
  trade for the new shares is recorded in your portfolio, in addition to the dividend
  record. And your performance figures are updated accordingly.\n\n![Dividend Reinvestment
  Plan](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2Kf1asmCjJx1PYBAgY2jJ5/51af692d8a6cd0b5f17d8389dc3ec78c/Dividend_Reinvestment_Plan.png?w=950)\n\nAutomating
  day-to-day portfolio transactions can save you hours of manual updates at the end
  of the year. And with everything always up to date and in one place, you’ll always
  know exactly how you’re doing.\n\n## Automate your portfolio tracking with Sharesight\nSharesight
  was built to make it easy for investors like you to *spend more time investing*
