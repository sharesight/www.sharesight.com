:title: 3 Sharesight email alerts you should enable today
:content: "[Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/) users can subscribe to a weekly
  portfolio summary email that shows you an overview of your portfolio’s performance
  over the last 7 days, as well as an email alert every time the price of one of your
  holdings spikes or collapses by 5% in a single trading day. \n\nYou can also be
  alerted every time one of your holdings distributes a dividend payment, has a name
  change, a split, a consolidation and more by subscribing to company event alerts.
  For a full breakdown of what each alert email can do for you, read below.\n\n##
  How do I subscribe to these alerts?\n\nTo subscribe to these alerts, visit your
  [portfolio overview page](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/) then click
  Settings > Alert Settings. You can then enable/disable and customise the three email
  alerts available to you:\n\n![email-alerts-callout](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7BYrdhVIpqOogs4KWmcCoG/560252b59e4b358bcafcaa96505f1248/email-alerts-callout.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Why is subscribing to these three email alerts important?\n\n### Weekly portfolio
  summary email\n\nThe weekly portfolio summary provides a summary of your Sharesight
  portfolio's performance for the last 7 days. When enabling the weekly portfolio
  summary email you can customise the day of the week you’d like to receive the email,
  which the Sharesight platform will send after the close of the day’s trading.\n\nThe
  summary email contains the key absolute figures and % change for each share/market
  your portfolio is invested in over the 7 days it covers. This includes the  price
  at market close, current value, capital gain, any dividends paid, currency gain/loss
  (if applicable) and the total % return for the week. So even if you don’t have time
  to login to Sharesight, or check your portfolio on the [Sharesight Mobile App](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/introducing-the-sharesight-mobile-app/),
  you’ll still know how you’re tracking.\n\n![Screenshot weekly-portfolio-email](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6y1OwVgGooUuIgiWoemAcK/20bc2ba6772469918d18267b6b9bcdf8/Screenshot_weekly-portfolio-email.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Company event alerts\n\nWhen enabled, company event alerts are automatically emailed
  to you any time a holding in your portfolio makes a company announcement, such as
  a dividend or share split. Sharesight typically automates [corporate actions](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/)
  in your portfolio, but it is important for you to check and confirm the data in
  Sharesight is correct whenever these company events occur, especially if you are
  using the data from Sharesight when preparing your tax return.\n\nThe most common
  company event most investors see is a dividend payment, which includes a link to
  view the transaction in their Sharesight portfolio and confirm/edit the data to
  ensure it is accurate.\n\n![screenshot email-company-event](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/42F2nnuPGwGIqswkSqA6Cu/1898804eed096ecac4b7e97f012802b8/screenshot_email-company-event.png?w=950)\n\n######
  NOTE: Every so often highly complicated corporate actions do not get automated.
  The reason for this is that there is the need for you to make an important and personal
  financial decision. An example of such a corporate action is the issue of [renounceable
  rights](https://help.sharesight.com/renounceable-rights/). Sharesight cannot know
  whether you wish to take up your rights or if you would like to sell them.\n\n###
  Price Alerts\n\nA price alert email is triggered if the closing share price of one
  of your holdings differs from the opening price by more than 5%. This email is important
  to track and explore sudden movements and volatility in your holdings, usually triggered
  by significant market events that might necessitate active management of your portfolio.
