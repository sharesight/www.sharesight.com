:url_slug: top-20-asx-trades-sharesight-users-august-2021
:content: "Welcome to the August 2021 edition of Sharesight’s monthly ASX trading
  snapshot, where we look at the top 20 trades Sharesight users made on the ASX during
  the month. \n\nIn this snapshot, buy trades were led by Vanguard’s Australian Shares
  Index (ASX: VAS) and International Shares (ASX: VGS) ETFs. At the same time, sell
  trades were led by Afterpay (ASX: APT), which has accepted a US$29b takeover bid
  by US BNPL giant Square. Sell trades were followed by Fortescue Metals (ASX: FMG),
  which saw its share price plummet in August due to low iron ore prices. Overall,
  this month’s top trades were largely composed of mining companies, with many miners
  involved in lucrative deals, new projects or allegations of misconduct. \n\n## Top
