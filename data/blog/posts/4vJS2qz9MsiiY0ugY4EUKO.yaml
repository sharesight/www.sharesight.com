:title: 4 metrics to monitor the health of your investment portfolio
:content: "###### NOTE: A version of this article first appeared on the [ASX website](https://www.asx.com.au/education/investor-update-newsletter/201811-get-a-total-portfolio-picture-and-stay-calm.htm),
  and a newer version of this article is here: *[4 ways to monitor the health of your
  investment portfolio](/blog/4-ways-to-monitor-the-health-of-your-investment-portfolio/)*.\n\nOctober
  2018 was a tense month for investors worldwide. There is already a lot of superstition
  surrounding this month; this coupled with the media doomsday forecast of crashing
  markets, and an escalating trade war between China and the US, it's no wonder investors
  were on the edge of their seats.\n\nSince the beginning of the Dow, October has
  consistently taken the crown as the [month with the most volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/octobereffect.asp);
  even when you remove the crashes of October 1929 and 1987.\n\nEven when expected,
  I understand that volatility can make anyone anxious, and leave some wishing for
  the good ol' days when you simply paid money into a superannuation fund and in however
  many years it sprouted into a large sum, and you'd be all set for retirement. While
  this sounds like a dream, it is sadly no longer an actuality.\n\nAs is being highlighted
  with findings from the Royal Commission's probe into our superannuation sector:
  it's best that individuals take ownership of their own investments. The old system
  is no longer working for us.  \n\nSo, how does one keep from losing cool while the
  financial markets seem to be going rabid? Easy. Understanding how your portfolio
  has been performing overall, not just in the last month, is the best antidote to
  help you remain calm and make the best decisions. To help you do that, use these
  4 metrics to monitor the health of your investment portfolio:\n\n## 1. Annualised
  Total Performance\n\nKeeping track of your annualised total performance is essential
  as it helps you to understand how your investments are doing, thus helping you to
  make informed (rather than impulsive) decisions.\n\nYou must track everything.\n\nIf
  I asked you what your online brokerage account plus superannuation plus employee
  shares are worth, could you give me an accurate figure? Often times, even those
  investors who *think* they know how they’re doing often aren’t calculating their
  true returns. That’s because they rely on one or both of the following:\n\n### a)
  Relying on their broker\n\n[Broker performance figures](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/4-reasons-to-stop-relying-on-your-brokers-performance-reports/)
  are often just the difference between what you paid and since the latest market
  price. These figures aren't right because:\n\n* They don’t factor dividends (and
  dividend reinvestment plans) into your returns\n\n* They don’t factor brokerage
  fees or currency fluctuations into your returns\n\n* They don’t provide a total
  annualised return (a 20% return over five years is really only a 4% return per year)\n\n###
  b) Relying on a spreadsheet\n\nI'm sure you don't need me to tell you that tracking
  your investments on a spreadsheet is tedious manual work that is prone to errors.
  Just in case you're a spreadsheet lover, and that one went in one ear and out the
  other, let me repeat: Tracking your investments on a spreadsheet does not guarantee
  you are calculating your true returns. \n\nWe used to love spreadsheets, too, but
  thanks to technology we have been able to improve these old systems. Isn't it results
  that we're all looking for? Replace your manual and labour-intensive spreadsheet
  with [portfolio tracking software](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)
  that provides:\n\n* Automatic updates\n\n* Your true performance\n\n* A visualisation
  of your portfolio\n\n## 2. Dividend Yield\n\nDividends make up part of your performance
  returns; if you’re not tracking them, you’re not getting the full picture. This
  is especially true if you participate in a [dividend reinvestment plan (DRP)](https://help.sharesight.com/drp/).
  \n\nAmazingly, most online brokers don’t factor dividends or DRPs into their return
  figures. Meaning you are not getting a complete picture of your performance returns.
  \n\nTo be a successful investor with dividends in your portfolio, you must understand
  the following: \n\n* How to properly track the funds you receive\n\n* The tax implications\n\n*
  The impact of dividend reinvestment\n\nSadly, [tracking dividends](/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  is labour intensive and can be a severe pain in the neck. Again, smart tracking
  technology is the solution to these problems as we can now automatically receive
  dividend information from the share registries, including tax information and you
  can enrol an entire holding into a dividend reinvestment plan, or reinvest specific
  dividends. Nothing is left open to error. \n\n## 3. Asset Allocation\n\nReviewing
  the impact of your [asset allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/)
  lets you understand the true drivers of your performance, be they stock selection,
  asset allocation, or exposure to certain countries, sectors, or industries. Asset
  allocation also helps you to easily compare and contrast the winners and losers
  in your portfolio – so you can make the most of your investments.\n\n[Diversification](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/investment-diversification-why-does-it-matter/)
  is an effective way to manage risk/return, limit exposure to any single asset and
  align your portfolio with the level of risk appropriate for your situation. You
  may be in a position to take riskier growth assets, or you may need to favour an
  asset mix of cash and defensive holding. \n\nYou should review your asset allocation
  across various dimensions including: Market, Sector classification, Industry classification,
  Investment type, Country, etc. \n\n## 4. Benchmarking\n\nBenchmarking your portfolio
  allows you to determine the relative performance of your portfolio compared to the
  overall market during a particular period. You’ll understand whether you \"beat
  the benchmark\" or “beat the market”, and if not, it allows you to consider what
  else you could have done with your money.\n\nFor example, if you want to [track
  the performance of your portfolio against the ASX200](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)
  index, select an ETF that is modelled on that index (such as ASX: A200) which provides
  a true apples-to-apples comparison. \n\nDon't compare your portfolios against the
  index prices you see in the news.\n\n**Keep your portfolio healthy**\n\nGetting
  an accurate picture of the health of your investment portfolio can be tough with
  so many moving pieces to shuffle. Left to spreadsheets and third parties, you expose
  yourself to incomplete pictures of your portfolio, which can lead to poor decision
  making. Combine these four tactics, with portfolio management technology like [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/),
  to gain ultimate control of your investment portfolio. Keep your portfolio healthy
