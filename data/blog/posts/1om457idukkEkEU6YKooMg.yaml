:title: Sharesight at Intersekt 2018
:content: "I popped down to Melbourne for a couple of days to attend [Intersekt](https://www.blackbirdcounselling.com.au),
  the Australian fintech industry’s annual conference.\n\nIt’s certainly encouraging
  to see how fintech has scaled in Australia over the past few years. The conference
  now attracts 400 plus attendees over three full days. Australia’s well-regulated
  banking system combined with the negative outcome of the Banking Royal Commission
  have continued to provide fertile ground for local startups and overseas entrants.\n\n![intersekt

  attention on fintech leads to more startups, more curious bankers, more venture
  capital, more media, not to mention more traditional businesses calling themselves
  fintechs. \n\nSo as these events get bigger, it does become difficult to distill
  what it all means for Australian investors and consumers.\n\nHere are some of the
  key things to watch out for:\n\n## Open Banking in Australia\n\n![intersekt festival

  a consumer or investor, [open banking](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/open-banking-changes-in-australia/)
  will have an impact on your back pocket, but it will take time and is still very
  much a work in progress.\n\nLet’s be honest, the average consumer probably doesn’t
  know what open banking is, nor will they care much about it when it’s a reality.
  How one implements it, and the quality of the data are still questions without answers.\n\nReally,
  the onus will fall on fintechs to make use of the open banking legislation and deliver
  value to the market.\n\nWhile there was good discussion regarding open banking,
  it seems that most players are still executing their own vision for what it means.
  I’ve yet to see a real (public) clash between banks and fintechs regarding access
  to an individual’s financial data. \n\n### Takeaways & tidbits overheard:\n\n- Banks
  like open banking because they can make “smarter” (more aggressive?) loans by leveraging
  specialist data and cash flow companies. Yikes.\n- Fintechs don’t necessarily want
  to “own” personally identifiable information - this comes with big IT and legal
  overheads.\n- The horse may have already bolted. In the absence of a mature policy
  fintechs have already circumvented the banks with respect to accessing financial
  data and are already using it to offer real product alternatives. I heard “well,
  we’ve already sort of built that” numerous times (think about how your trading history
  has built up in Sharesight despite a lack of an “open broking” data policy).\n-
  Don’t sleep on Macquarie Bank. They’ve had an open API for years and have already
  embraced open banking. We use [their API](https://www.macquarie.com/au/personal/campaigns/macquarie-open-platform/)
  at Sharesight, and while it has limitations, it’s an indicator of how Macquarie
  is thinking long term and how to commercialise open banking themselves.\n\n## Neo
  or Challenger Banks\n\nThis was my favourite topic at the conference, and one that
  I see as most applicable to Australian consumers. The term “neo” or “challenger”
  bank refers to startup banks that are branchless and 100% web and mobile based.\n\nChad
  West from Revolut, a UK-based banking alternative delivered an enthusiastic demonstration
  of their core banking features. While Revolut aspires to be your every day bank,
  it would seem that they are best known for their free peer-to-peer money transfer,
  foreign and cryptocurrency exchange.\n \nRevolut (and other successful fintechs)
  have absolutely nailed the user experience (UX) - their product is beautiful and
  I’ve already signed up to their waitlist. They’ve also expertly leveraged things
  like push notifications, real-time data, and mobile - digital things that we’ve
  come to expect from services like Uber and Google, and not our banks, which is a
  key differentiator for them.\n\n### Takeaways & tidbits overheard:\n\n- Revolut
  is launching in Australia in Q1 2019\n- A mate from the UK tells me that he uses
  them only for foreign currency when on holiday, and isn’t quite ready to direct
  his salary there. He says the pain of switching and the fact that his every day
  banking is mostly OK are holding him back. Plus Revolut pays no interest.\n- Revolut
  may launch a subscription model in which you’d pay a monthly fee to access a bundle
  of services. This is a novel twist on fees on each account / service, but in practice
  achieves a similar end result.\n- Will Australian KYC and AML laws (know your client,
  anti money laundering) hold them back locally? You can open your Revolut account
  in a matter of seconds in Europe. Front and back photos of your ID and a selfie
  were all it took during the demonstration. I’m not sure if that’s because they operate
  as a “borderless” fintech or due to more progressive EU/UK banking laws, but if
  you know how difficult it is to open an account in Australia, I can imagine this
  being an issue.\n- Revolut is also launching a share trading product - we’ll keep
  an eye on them for integration purposes!\n\n## Challenges and Opportunities Looking
  Ahead\n\nFintech is well and truly established and maturing in Australia. My unofficial
  “bankers-in-suits to founders-in-hoodies” ratio confirms this.\n\nA common question
  came up during the conference regarding the elephant(s) in the room. That is, how
  much interest do Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. have in the financial services
  space? Using China (e.g. Tencent) as a barometer would suggest that they will pounce
  on this market and may destroy some well-known fintechs in the process.\n\nAustralian
  bank reputations have been severely wounded by the Royal Commission, which has been
  Christmas-come-early for fintechs - especially those in wealth management.\n\nThere
  is still, however, a fundamental challenge facing industry: how to make consumers
  excited about financial products. \n\nSo much of the enthusiasm behind fintech comes
  from ex-industry heavyweights who understand how badly broken aspects of financial
  services are. Whether or not they can get the money-spending and investing public
  excited about their products remains to be seen.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- [Import
