:title: How mergers and acquisitions affect your investment performance
:url_slug: mergers-acquisitions-affect-investment-performance
:content: "When a merger or acquisition is announced for one of your stocks, it’s
  important to understand how this impacts your performance data, and what you need
  to do to track these stocks in your portfolio. While it may seem like this is all
  taken care of by your broker, this is not necessarily the case, with mergers and
  acquisitions often resulting in incorrect numbers and lost data in your brokerage
  account. To learn more about how brokers handle corporate mergers and acquisitions,
  why this leads to inaccurate performance figures (and tax records), plus how you
  can properly track these corporate actions in your portfolio, keep reading. \n\n![mergers
  (1)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4H8IEdCrMF9RkovGYO1jt/461d9dec899ef16f96f812c3116455cd/mergers__1_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What are mergers and acquisitions?\n\nMergers and acquisitions are a type of corporate
  action that can affect the holdings in an investor’s portfolio. An \"acquisition\"
  refers to a situation in which one company purchases another company and assumes
  control as the new owner of that company. A “merger”, on the other hand, refers
  to a situation in which two companies of a similar size come together as a singular
  entity, rather than operating as two separate companies. These phrases are sometimes
  used interchangeably as in many cases, mergers and acquisitions occur in tandem.
  This is not always the case, however. \n\nThese corporate actions can have implications
  for shareholders. The specifics of these implications will differ on a case-by-case
  basis, but to understand how these corporate actions can impact the performance
  of your investments, let’s look at a real-world example.\n\n### The Block (NYSE:
  SQ) and Afterpay (ASX: APT) merger\n\nIn early 2022, US digital payments firm Block
  officially acquired Australian buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) giant Afterpay, with the
  intention to merge the two companies as part of a multi-billion dollar deal. As
  per the Scheme Implementation Deed, Block agreed to establish a secondary listing
  on the ASX, allowing Afterpay shareholders to trade Block shares via CHESS Depository
  Interests (CDIs). Afterpay delisted from the ASX and shareholders were given the
  option to convert their shares into NYSE-listed Block Class A common stock or the
  above-mentioned ASX-listed CDIs (ASX: SQ2). \n\n## Why you shouldn’t rely on your
  broker to track mergers\n\nBefore any mergers have even occurred, relying solely
  on your [broker’s performance figures](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  can be misleading, as most brokers’ performance metrics typically consist of daily
  price movements and capital gains measured from the stock’s purchase date. Without
  the inclusion of key factors such as dividends, currency fluctuations and brokerage
  fees in your [performance calculations](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/),
  you are already failing to see the full picture of your portfolio’s performance.
  For more information about how your broker's performance data can be misleading,
  see [this](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  article. \n\nOnce a merger or acquisition has occurred, relying on your broker to
  handle these corporate actions in your portfolio can also result in inaccurate performance
  data. This is because once the corporate action takes place, many brokers will simply
  overwrite your previous data and replace it with the new holding. For example, if
  you held Afterpay shares with a return of 190% prior to the merger, once you were
  allocated your new ASX-listed CDIs, Afterpay would be removed from your portfolio,
  replaced by Block shares with a new return figure and cost base. This essentially
  wipes out that 190% return. If you received a combination of shares and cash in
  the merger, it is also likely that this will not be reflected in your brokerage
  account. \n\nNot only can this create problems when calculating your [Capital Gains
  Tax](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  (CGT), but it also misrepresents your performance as an investor. The screenshot
  below, for example, shows a portfolio that has been affected by the Afterpay/Block
  merger. When Afterpay is included in the portfolio’s performance figures, the total
  return is 38.46%. If Afterpay is removed, however, this figure is only 27.42%. This
  is an important distinction that can make a significant difference when evaluating
  your investment strategy. \n\n![Sharesight merge performance2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4n2rF7Xv3GyCQbaWNTHN6c/49a91d9a0c7e7fe9bdf9d24a21fbc1e9/Sharesight_merge_performance2.JPG)\n\n<small>
  Sharesight users have the option to view their total return inclusive of open and
  closed (sold) positions.</small>\n\nAnother problem with depending solely on your
  broker is that in many cases, they will not notify you of the merger ahead of time,
  if at all. This means that unless the stock in question is relatively large and
  high-profile, you may not even find out about the merger until after it has already
  occurred, making it too late to make an informed decision on whether to buy or sell
  the original stock. Therefore, investors who are tracking their shares in a spreadsheet
  or relying on their broker will also need to keep track of Annual General Meetings
  (AGMs) and search for news for the stocks in their portfolio. This can be tedious,
  especially for investors with large portfolios. \n\n## Easily track mergers in your
  Sharesight portfolio \n\nWith Sharesight’s online portfolio tracker, it’s easy for
  investors to stay informed about upcoming mergers and acquisitions and keep track
  of these corporate actions in their portfolio. This allows investors to make informed
  investment decisions, while also preserving their tax records and making it easier
  to calculate CGT. \n\n### Receive alerts about upcoming corporate actions\n\nSharesight
  users can elect to receive email notifications about a range of corporate actions,
  including stock splits, dividends, company name changes and mergers and acquisitions.
  This can be activated via the Alert Settings in the Holdings tab. \n\nInvestors
  can also view the latest news for holdings in their portfolio via Sharesight’s RSS
  feed function, which provides news coverage for stocks on the ASX, LSE, NYSE, NASDAQ
  and other key US markets. \n\n### Adjust for mergers in your portfolio\n\nOnce a
  merger has occurred, this can be easily tracked using Sharesight’s [merge feature](https://help.sharesight.com/mergers/).
  Simply click into the relevant holding, scroll down to ‘Holding Settings’ and select
  ‘Merge this holding’. You only need a few key details to initiate the merge in your
  portfolio, as seen in the screenshot below.\n\n**Note:** This feature applies to
  shares which are subject to 100% rollover relief, such as Afterpay/Block. To handle
  a merger without rollover relief, you can add buy and sell trades against the original
  stock and the new stock, as described in [this](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-handle-the-afterpay-afy-and-touchcorp-tch-merger/)
  article. \n\n![Sharesight merge feature](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/qxujNLK4yc3qt42wHSCdM/d36c6ba800f3fd34b9a4eb8b24d6e96c/Sharesight_merge_feature.JPG)\n\n<small>
  To track a merger in their Sharesight portfolio, investors simply need to enter
  the merger date, new holding ticker and new quantity of shares. </small>\n\nInvestors
  who have received a combination of shares and residual cash in a merger can also
  track their cash payment in Sharesight by clicking into the merged holding and adding
  a new dividend with details of the payment. \n\nOnce the merge has been completed,
  investors will retain performance data and records for the original stock, while
  also tracking the new merged stock with an updated cost base carrying across from
  the original stock, as well as any records of residual cash received in the merger.
  This allows investors to accurately calculate [Capital Gains Tax](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  (CGT) on their investments – saving time (and confusion) at tax time. \n\n## Start
