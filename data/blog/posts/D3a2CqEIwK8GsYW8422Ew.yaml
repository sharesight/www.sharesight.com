:title: Benchmarking your portfolio against ETFs
:content: "###### UPDATE: 30-May-2019: You may now [benchmark your portfolio against
  any stock, ETF, or fund](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)\n\nIf
  you haven’t switched on the [benchmarking feature in Sharesight](/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/),
  give it a try. You can track the performance of your portfolio against our universe
  of ETFs. \n\nMost [Sharesight](/) clients build their own portfolios with an eye
  towards DIY diversification that suits their expectations and [risk tolerance](/blog/does-your-investment-portfolio-match-your-appetite-for-risk/).
  This means [benchmarking](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/) against a single
  stock market or index isn’t ideal.\n\nA common [client request](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/benchmarking-now-live)
  has been to allow for benchmarking against a diversified portfolio. Typically, “diversified”
  means some combination of underlying assets that combine to form everything from
  a conservative to a growth strategy. \n\n## There’s an ETF for that\n\nTo get started,
  look at the ETFs listed over at the [ETF database in their “diversified” section](http://etfdb.com/etfdb-category/diversified-portfolio/)
  - any of these that trade on markets Sharesight tracks are a good place to start.
  For example, Vanguard [just announced](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/au/portal/articles/insights/mediacentre/new-vanguard-etfs.jsp)
  the launch of four diversified ETFs in Australia, ranging from conservative to high
  growth. These new Vanguard ETFs are:\n\n- VDBA.AX [Vngd Div Balance Etf Units](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8218/?overview)\n-
  VDCO.AX [Vngd Div Conserv Etf Units](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8219/?overview)\n-
  VDHG.AX [Vngd Div High Growth Etf Units](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8221/?overview)\n-
  VDGR.AX [Vngd Div Growth Etf Units](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8220/?overview)\n\nBroadly
  the new Vanguard ETFs look like this:\n\n![Featured-diversified-etf](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4Z9wNFMLcsy24WEqEq86ee/17108ce983e2c26575954687074ad051/Featured-diversified-etf.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Why benchmark your portfolio against ETFs?\n\nBenchmarking against the “index” or
  the “S&P” is purely theoretical. If you were actually going to invest in the market
  you’d have to do it through a security of some kind (or by recreating the index
  yourself).\n\nToo many investors have been conditioned to compare their portfolios
  against the index prices they see online and in the news. \n\n###### ETFs are a
  superior benchmark because they’re a legitimate investment option and they take
  into account all the inner workings of a real portfolio, including fees, dividends
  and any [franking credits](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/dividend-franking-and-performance/)
  that may apply. \n\n## How to select ETFs as a portfolio benchmark\n\nFrom the [Portfolio
  Overview page](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/), click on the \"Add
  a Benchmark\" button. In the \"Search for a Benchmark\" field, type the ETF market
  code and select the desired ETF from the results (in the image below, we entered
  the VDBA.AX Vngd Div Balance Etf Units code).\n\n![screenshot - sharesight benchmark](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5CJekx56fYMQ0wEgMWeu6U/e33f41c6a6ca001479b47204af8f4471/screenshot_sharesight-benchmark_2018-06-15.png?w=950)\n\nThen
  select the “Graph performance index” option in the chart type drop-down menu to
  see your performance against the benchmark:\n\n![Graph Performance Index ETF](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/i6LKxgTihM8ASIS8scwYM/0c7058be92a94ac8aaa8c5de901fbe64/Graph_Performance_Index.png?w=950)\n\nOur
  calculation engine assumes a common investment amount and start date to show you
  a true comparison -- both in terms of raw data, and in the chart. In this instance
  we’ve selected a time period of one week -- as these new Vanguard ETFs are only
  new to the market and will not have price data for earlier periods.\n\nMake sure
  to read our [step-by-step guide to benchmarking](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/)
  as well as our Help section on [how to interpret the return index graph](https://help.sharesight.com/interpreting-the-return-index-graph/).\n\nBenchmarking
  is available to all Sharesight clients on [Investor, Expert](/pricing/), and [Sharesight
  Pro](/pro/) plans -- to access this feature [upgrade today](/pricing/)!\n\n### Further
