:title: 5 easy steps to get organised at EOFY
:content: "It’s easier than ever to use technology to get your investments organised
  for the end of the Australian financial year (EOFY). Whether you want to check performance
  or organise tax information, you’re a lot closer than you think to being a “life
  admin” all-star.\n\n![featured - sharesight - sunrise](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/591byGFFZuYOKCYIsQAswc/02685fc279ef6e89d34a98205b6f7b25/featured_sharesight_sunrise.jpg?w=950)\n\n##

  brings together data from brokers, share registries, and paper statements to give
  you a complete picture of your investment portfolio. Using Sharesight means your
  investments are actually one of the simpler aspects of your finances to get prepped
  for tax time. \n \nDon’t believe me? Let’s use my holding in Alumina (AWC) from
  my portfolio as an example.\n \nIf you can access historical buy and sell trading
  records, you’ll need:\n\n| Investment Code (ticker) | Number of Units | Trade Date
  | Execution Price |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| AWC
  \       | 354        | 18/06/2014 | $1.44      |\n\n<small>*Tip: if you used an
  online broker to trade during the financial year, this is the best option.*<small>\n
  \nIf you don’t have access to transaction data, use an opening balance:\n\n| Investment
  Code (ticker) | Cost Base | Number of Units | Opening Balance Date |\n| ----------
  | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| AWC       | $509.76       | 354       |
  18/06/2014       |\n\n<small>*Tip: if your records are a mess, or you’re looking
  to make a fresh start this is the best path to take. A cost base can represent a
  number of trades and corporate actions so it’s less data to worry about. Your financial
  statements will include cost base or balance information.*</small>\n\nWe’ve talked
  a lot about [the limitations of your online broker](/blog/why-do-i-need-sharesight-with-my-online-broker/).
  Fortunately, using [Sharesight](/) means you can trade through your broker and leave
  the rest to us.\n \n## Step 1: Find out how many shares you own\n \nThe first step
  to getting organised at EOFY is to find out how many units (shares) you own in each
  investment by checking the share registry or [CHESS](/blog/what-is-chess/).\n\n[Share
  registries don’t care about you](/blog/why-share-registries-arent-enough/), the
  investor. But, you do need to login to their websites or track down the statements
  they’ve snail mailed you to find out how many units of each investment you own.
  Keep in mind you’ll probably need to do this on more than one registry. \n \nThe
  three major Australian share registries are Computershare, Link, and Board Room.
  Using their websites is a brutal experience, but you only need to do it once. Just
  look for the company and quantity. That’s all you need. Here’s my holding in Alumina
  (AWC):\n\n![screenshot - awc](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/107i8zG82acGeymyWAKwye/d5eda1b77cadf94012cd3eb51e2f2592/screenshot_awc.png?w=950)\n\nIf
  relying on the paper statement, it will look similar. Also keep in mind that registries
  may require you to create separate accounts if you have multiple Holder Identification
  Numbers (HINs). While annoying and inefficient, Sharesight will aggregate the data
  for you because you’re in control of how you structure a tax entity.\n \nAlternatively,
  the ASX operates a system known as CHESS, which is like a share registry. Any ASX-listed
  shares you’ve traded through a CHESS sponsored broker will also be reflected in
  CHESS.\n \nCHESS will post you statements with the number of units you hold in each
  security. There is no online CHESS facility, incredibly. In your shoe box, look
  for paperwork with the ASX logo, chances are that’s a CHESS statement.\n \nImportantly,
  CHESS will not know of any units you bought or sold “off-market,” such as an employee
  share purchase plan, a corporate action such as a demerger, or via certain IPOs.\n
  \n## Step 2: Gather your trade details from your broker\n \nOn your broker’s website,
  look for a page called “transactions” or “confirmations.” Here’s how my AWC buy
  trade looks in my broker, for example:\n \n![screenshot - awc - broker](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/JOUopxAva6Q2e6mYuQ4WQ/e8ab7ac14246cc537e99cd13857d85bf/screenshot_awc-broker.png?w=950)\n\nMost
  brokers also let you download your trading history to a spreadsheet (.csv) file.
  If you're able to do so, go ahead and download it.\n \n## Step 3: Enter the data
  into Sharesight\n\nIf you don't already use Sharesight, simply [sign up for a Free
  account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup).\n\nOnce in Sharesight, follow
  the relevant prompts based on how you plan to enter the data:\n\n- If you’ve made
  just a few (less than 10) trades throughout the year, it’s easy to [punch these
  into Sharesight manually](https://help.sharesight.com/setting-up-your-holdings/).\n\n-
  If you’ve traded a bit more, use our [Broker Import](https://help.sharesight.com/importing-your-trading-history-directly-from-your-broker/)
  feature to automatically import your trading history.\n \n- Most brokers also let
  you download your trading history to a spreadsheet (.csv) file. This can be uploaded
  to Sharesight using our [Bulk Upload](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/)
  feature. \n\nHere’s how this looks when manually entering my AWC buy trade:\n\n![screenshot

  here’s how this *would* look if using an opening balance. Sharesight will automatically
  work out the market value based on the data you provide:\n \n![screenshot - opening
  balance - awc](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/67Z6CW8WQgyAQe6oOWgawS/892b0aefb3c12a0fc5a61081294a4c89/screenshot_opening-balance_awc.png?w=950)\n
  \n## Step 4: Confirm your dividends\n \nSharesight has calculated your performance,
  including capital gains/losses, the impact of dividend income, and currency effects
  if holding something overseas. Much of the Sharesight magic involves how we automate
  dividends. \n \nOn the AWC holding page check out how Sharesight has automatically
  populated the five dividends I’ve received since my first AWC buy. We even automatically
  factor in the franking credit information:\n\n![screenshot - dividends - awc](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/RCG70hTKYEGwcMI4WEQ6O/27d12e39ce6a132733c0a83a04dc579a/screenshot_dividends_awc.png?w=950)\n
  \nHere’s how the dividend history for AWC appears on the share registry website.
  Notice how the Net dividend matches the Franked amounts in Sharesight exactly.\n\n![screenshot

  you’ve enrolled in a [dividend reinvestment plan (DRP)](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/),
  not to worry. You can switch this on in Sharesight and we’ll reinvest the historical
  dividends on your behalf.  \n \nIt’s important to note that the data automatically
  populated in Sharesight is considered “as reported.” It’s a good idea to double-check
  your dividend history against the share registry. They’re the ones who actually
  dole out the payments. Once OK, you can confirm each dividend or do so in bulk.\n\nBrokers
  give you one half of the picture, share registries give you the other. You can only
  be a successful and organised investor if you combine the two.\n \n## Step 5: Share
  portfolio access with your accountant\n \nIf your data was at hand the above process
  should have taken you just a few minutes. Now it’s time to wow your accountant --
  and drive down the cost of your accounting invoice. All the work is done!\n \nUnder
  the Sharing & Permissions tab, you’ll find a simple way to [share your portfolio
  with your accountant](https://help.sharesight.com/memberships_index/). We recommend
  giving them \"Read and Write\" access so they can make edits if need be.\n \n![screenshot

  Bonus: Run your own tax reports\n\n- **[The Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/taxable_income/)**
  lists all dividend payments and interest payments received during the year, which
  you are required to include in your tax return to the ATO.\n- **[The Capital Gains
  Tax Report](/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)** calculates
  capital gains made on sold shares as per ATO rules.\n- **[The Unrealised CGT Report](/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)**
  makes it easy to lower your capital gain tax obligations by modelling the implications
  of selling shares to offset gains and losses you incurred during the year.\n\n##

  portfolio tracker that by its very nature makes performance and tax information

  In most cases, Australian tax residents can claim next year’s subscription fee on
