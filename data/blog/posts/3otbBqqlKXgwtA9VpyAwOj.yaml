  January 2021 edition of the Sharesight20USA monthly trading snapshot, where we look
  at Sharesight users’ top 20 trades in US stocks on the Nasdaq, NYSE and [AMEX](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/)
  over the month. \n\n## Sharesight20 top 20 US stock trades January 2021\n\n![Top
  20 NASDAQ + NYSE+AMEX month january2021](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6Cu1sf9RamNQsBddJAgSzH/e27072794fb0a6b4e297c3d9361622f6/Top_20__NASDAQ___NYSE_AMEX_month_january2021.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  January’s Sharesight20USA snapshot, trades were strongly led by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA),
  which is trading at an all-time high ahead of its Q4 earnings report. Trades were
  followed by Tesla rival Nio (NYSE: NIO), which recently announced record-breaking
  car deliveries at its Nio Day event. Perhaps the biggest story this month, however,
  is the chaos surrounding GameStop (NYSE: GME), a stock that had been targeted by
  short sellers [before catching the eye of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit](https://time.com/5933242/gamestop-stock-gme/).\n\nLet’s
