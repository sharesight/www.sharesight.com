:title: How to handle the Trustpower demerger
:content: "In December 2015, Trustpower announced it would undergo a process to demerge
  its wind assets in Australia and New Zealand, to produce two independent companies,
  New Trustpower and Tilt Renewables. Among the key reasons for the demerger were
  to enable each business to focus on their respective areas of specialisation, where
  Tilt Renewables can expand on Trustpower’s Australian wind development and generation
  business - also to take advantage of opportunities created by Australia’s Renewable
  Energy Target (RET) requirements - and New Trustpower can continue to expand on
  it’s current hydro electricity initiatives and multi-product retail strategy in
  New Zealand.\n\n![Featured - Trustpower demerger](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5WV6usLTDUsKoeSC0WaMmA/2e8975d4fdb045b4babf89af7b345597/featured_trustpower-demerger.png?w=950)\n\nAfter
  shareholders voted in favour of the demerger, Trustpower began the process of implementing
  the scheme, which would see the existing listing, Trustpower, liquidated to form
  the two new companies. Existing Trustpower shareholders would then receive one share
  in each of the new companies, for each one Trustpower share they held at the ‘Record
  Date’, the 28th of October. \n\n[Sharesight](/) makes it easy for shareholders,
  particularly from New Zealand or Australia, to account for this demerger within
  their Sharesight portfolio.\n\n## Tax Residents of New Zealand\n\nFor Trustpower
  shareholders who are tax residents of New Zealand, Trustpower received a binding
  agreement from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) on a number of key points, which
  included the following:\n\n- The distribution of shares in ‘Tilt Renewables’ and
  ‘New Trustpower’ would not be considered a ‘dividend’, therefore no imputation credits
  or withholding taxes apply.\n- Trustpower shareholders ***may*** be subject to NZ
  income tax on gains made (or allowed a deduction for loss sustained)\tin certain
  circumstances, e.g. Trustpower Shareholder is in the business of dealing in shares,
  disposes of the Trustpower Shares as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme,
  or acquired the Trustpower Shares with the purpose of selling them.\n\nTo account
  for the above, in this step-by-step, we have followed instruction per the scheme
  booklet which advises that the ‘amount received for disposal’ for your original
  TPW shares, will be equal to the market value of the shares received in each of
  the new companies, as at the ‘Distribution Date’ (November 1, 2016). These market
  values will form the basis for your new holdings in Tilt Renewables (TLT) and New
  Trustpower (TPW). For this example, we are using the closing market price of each
  respective company, as at November 1.\n\nFirstly, from the ‘Overview’ page, or via
  the ‘Holdings’ tab, click the ‘Add or Import Holdings’ button. On the next page,
  search for either ‘Tilt Renewables’ or ‘Trustpower’, or search by code - TLT or
  TPW.\n\n**NOTE** -- You will see two options for TPW, one of which will be greyed
  out. This represents the old TPW listing, so be sure to select the option that is
  not greyed out.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the correct stock form the search results,
  you will need to complete the transaction details. Select 01/11/2016 (1st November,
  2016) as the date and for the ‘Quantity’, enter the same number of units as your
  original Trustpower holding. Per our explanation above, the ‘Price’ we will use
  is the closing price for the same date. Click ‘Save Holding’ once finished, to save
  this transaction.\n\n![Screenshot - Trustpower demerger 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6m3e4bWYy4o40UIAqWW8Kg/3942c022e14b0441b648d3cdf49bc8dc/screenshot_trustpower-demerger_1.png?w=950)\n\nOnce
  you’ve saved this, repeat the steps above for the other company, i.e. Tilt Renewables
  (TLT).\n\n![Screenshot - Trustpower demerger 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3P4KeUSqwgcUsWuoqywi4o/320340980eb0ad321b938980d740fd3f/screenshot_trustpower-demerger_2.png?w=950)\n\nAfter
  you have entered your second new company and saved, you will be taken to the ‘Overview’
  page. From here, click into your original Trustpower holding. Remember, your original
  holding should now be greyed out, to indicate that it is no longer trading. Once
  you’ve arrived at the ‘Holdings’ page for your original Trustpower holding, click
  ‘Enter a New Trade or Adjustment’:\n\n![Screenshot - Trustpower demerger 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/14k4LCz5cw8wSouyweUUwa/3e30f9439573245aed8520dac4deaa8d/screenshot_trustpower-demerger_3.png?w=950)\n\nFrom
  the ‘Type’ drop-down, select ‘Sell’, to reflect the ‘disposal’ of these shares.
  The ‘Date’ will be the ‘Distribution Date’, 01/11/2016. The ‘Quantity’ will be the
  total quantity remaining. The ‘Price’ will be the sum of the market values of your
  holdings in Tilt Renewables and New Trustpower (as calculated in the last two steps),
  divided by your original TPW quantity. For example:\n\n**Market Value of Tilt (TLT)**<br>$22,000\n\n**Market
  Value of New Trustpower (TPW)**<br>$49,100\n\n**Original Trustpower Quantity**<br>10,000\n\n**‘Sell’
  price for original Trustpower**<br>(22,000 + 49,100) divided by 10,000 = $7.11\n\nHere,
  we’ve also chosen to leave a comment, referencing the demerger as the reason for
  this ‘Sell’ transaction. Once complete, click ‘Save Changes’.\n\n**NOTE** -- If
  you are classified as a ‘Trader’ for tax purposes, you can refer to the [Traders
  Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/traders_tax/) within Sharesight, to view
  any gain or loss on the disposal of your Trustpower shares.\n\n## Tax Residents
  of Australia\n\nFor tax residents of Australia, Trustpower has advised that rollover
  relief, if elected for, will apply to this demerger. With that said, there will
  be a few differences in the steps you need to follow.\n\nIf you have elected for
  rollover relief, you will need to enter a ‘Sell’ transaction against your original
  Trustpower shares at a price that matches the existing cost-base, so as not to incur
  any Capital Gain on this disposal. The date for this will be 01/11/2016 (1st November,
  2016). The ‘Quantity’ will be the current position in Trustpower and the ‘Price’
  should be your original purchase price. If your Trustpower holding was purchased
  in more than one parcel, you can check your cost base by referring to the ‘Holding
  Information’ tab, on your Trustpower holding page. \n\n![Screenshot - Trustpower

  you’ve saved this transaction, refer to the ‘Capital Gain’ figure in the same page,
  to confirm that the ‘Sell’ transaction has resulted in a $0 Capital Gain.\n\nWhen
  it comes to adding the new Trustpower and Tilt Renewables holdings, we have chosen
  to use the apportioned cost base(s) to create the new positions, as these figures
  will form the basis for determining any capital gain/loss if you decide to sell
  your new shares. Per the Scheme booklet, the ‘Tax Cost Base’ of the Tilt Renewables
  and New Trustpower shares ‘will be determined by allocating the shareholder’s existing
  tax cost base in Trustpower across the shares, based on the respective market values
  of Tilt Renewables and New Trustpower.’\n\nThe best place to start would be the
  [Historical Cost Report](https://help.sharesight.com/historical_cost_report/), under
  the ‘Reports’ tab. Using this report, set the ‘End’ date to the 31/10/2016 (31st
  October, 2016). The ‘Start’ date can be as far back as required. Once you’ve applied
  this to the report, take a note of the ‘Closing Balance’ figure. Remember that this
  will be in $AUD, which will be required when entering your new holdings.\n\n![Screenshot

  Market Price of Tilt Renewables and New Trustpower shares, as at 01/11/2016, were
  NZ$2.20 and NZ$4.91 respectively. This will represent 30.94% and 69.06% of the original
  Trustpower cost base, respectively. Using the ‘Closing Balance’ figure from the
  Historical Cost report, apply both percentages to work out the starting ‘Tax Cost
  Base’ for each of the new holdings, e.g. $72,632.77 x 0.3094 = $22,472.58, $72632.77
  x 0.6906 = $50,160.19.\n\nFrom here, you have all the information you need to begin
  adding your new holdings. From either the ‘Holdings’ tab, or ‘Overview’ page, click
  the ‘Add or Import Holdings’ button. On this new page, type in either of the new
  code (TLT or TPW - be sure to select the TPW that is not greyed out). We advise
  to use an ‘Opening Balance’ transaction, with a date 01/11/2016 (1st November, 2016).
  The ‘Cost Base’ will be the ‘Tax Cost Base’ calculated in the paragraph above, and
  the ‘Quantity’ will be the number of units held in the new company.\n\n![Screenshot

  you can see above, we’ve also nominated the given ‘Market Price’, to ensure performance
  is calculated correctly going forward. Once you’ve finished, click ‘Save this Holding’
  and repeat for the next holding.\n\n**NOTE** -- In our example, we use the 1st of
  November as the opening date for each of the new holdings. While this is correct
  for [performance reporting](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/), it
  will not factor in any applicable [CGT](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/)
  discounts if you sell shares within 12 months, given that rollover relief is applicable.
  With that said, we advise to make a personal note as reminder to factor in the discount
  on any gain figures, if you decide to sell within 12 months.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n-
