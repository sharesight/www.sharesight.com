:content: "Have you considered investing, but don't know where to start? One way to
  get started is by starting a share club. We've partnered with the fixed-fee legal
  experts at **[LegalVision](https://legalvision.com.au)** to put together this handy
  infographic on how to set up a share club in Australia:\n\n![How To Set Up A Share
  Club](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2zYfRNcIPKguKCSCcIkGay/1d138df33bca9d8f41165b75f9301271/infographic_how-to-set-up-a-share-club.gif)\n\n**PDF**

  \n\nHere's a quick re-cap:\n\n### Benefits of a share club\n\n- It's a fun way to
  learn about investing\n- It can draw together people with a wide range of skills
  and experience\n- You can achieve diversification on a relatively small investment\n-
  You can benefit from lowered costs through pooling\n- As a result of years of investing,
  many share clubs make a tidy profit\n- There are many social benefits (ahem, wine!)\n\n###
  Things to consider before you set up a share club\nThe easiest option is to join
  an existing share club but if that's not an option you can start your own. Here
  are some things to consider before doing so:\n\n- Determine your investing goals\n-
  Determine how long you want to hold your investments\n- Figure out your share club
  size\n\n### How to set up a share club\nOnce you've sorted those items out, you'll
  be ready to start formalizing your share club. But if you think you can just get
  a few friends together, make a few rules, and then start buying shares, think again.
  There are laws you need to beware of, as operating an informal club could prove
  problematic if there's a dispute. You'll need to:\n\n- **Appoint the club roles**
  (secretary, treasurer, etc).\n- **Determine the share ownership structure**, either
  a simple partnership or bare trust.\n- **Have a lawyer draft your share club's constitution
  and deed**, which you'll need to open a share trading account.\n- **Seek advice
  to avoid common pitfalls** : Learn from another share club (if possible), and use
  a lawyer, accountant, and possibly a financial adviser for legal and technical matters.\nFrom
  there, you'll need to:\n1. **Register your share club**\n2. **Acquire a tax file
  number (TFN)**\n3. **Open a bank and share trading account**\n4. **File an annual
  return**\n\n### Running a share club\nOnce you share club is up-and-running, you'll
  need to:\n\n- **Manage and track your share portfolio** so you know exactly how
  it's performing. This is where [Sharesight](/) shines. With daily price updates,
  powerful performance & diversity reporting, automatic inclusion of corporate actions
  such as share splits and dividends, and 1-click tax reports (including [Taxable
  Income](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/) and [Capital Gains Tax](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/))
  Sharesight makes share portfolio tracking and reporting a breeze. Plus, you can
  access it from everywhere and easily share access with everyone in the club.\n\n-
  **Hold regular meetings** to review the portfolio, get reports from the secretary
  and treasurer, read advice from the professional adviser (if using), and determine
  any follow-up activity. You'll also want to keep up-to-date records of all meetings
  for tax purposes.\n\n- **Avoid breaching ASIC regulations** and ensure members donâ€™t
  give financial advice\n\n- **Speak to your accountant** about how to account for
  tax\n\nWe hope you found this content useful. While there's a bit of work involved
  to get a share club started, once it's up and running (and the portfolio is tracking
  along nicely in Sharesight), it can be a greatly rewarding experience on many fronts!\n\n<small>*This
