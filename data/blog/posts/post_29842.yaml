:title: Xero award winners roundtable
:url_slug: hear-xero-award-winners
:content: "Recently, we were invited to participate in a Xero Award Winners roundtable
  by [Add-On Success](https://karbonhq.com/). The roundtable included other Xero Add-On
  winners: Receipt Bank, Float, Crowe Horwath, CFM Bookkeeping, Twomeys, 5Ways Group,
  and Wealth Enhancers. The discussion was a refreshing, free-flowing chat, and a
  rare opportunity to hear not only from Add-On partners, but also from professional
  firms using Xero.\n\n![Sharesight Xero Award Winner - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5NnPGTKLokaeKosKCyCUMO/5f5b0e25d2a411608365f89bb8263a9b/featured_sharesight-xero-award-winner.png?w=950)\n\nWe'll
  let you come up with your own takeaways, but for us the overriding theme was \"just
  do it.\" In the case of the Add-Ons, your product will never be 100% finished. Nor
  will ever be perfect. Instead of waiting for the perfect opportunity or for your
  product to catch up to the market, just get it out there and iterate based on client
  feedback. \n\nSurprisingly, the accounting and bookkeeping firms had similar advice
  for businesses thinking about moving into the cloud. They indicated that the automation
  gained from using Xero and the Add-Ons far outweighed the cost of remaining offline
  - even throughout a transition period. This is something we explain to prospective
  [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) clients all the time. Changing to a new process can be difficult,
  but try to measure the automation gained from an application like Sharesight versus
  the old, offline method in terms of billable hours wasted."
