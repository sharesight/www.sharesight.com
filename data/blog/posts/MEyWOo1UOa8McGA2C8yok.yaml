:title: 7 reasons why Sharesight is better than a spreadsheet
:content: "70% of investors come to [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/au/) having
  previously tracked their portfolio manually in a spreadsheet. We can’t blame them
  – until we built Sharesight, [we did the same thing](https://www.sharesight.com/au/about-sharesight/).
  So why is Sharesight better for tracking your investment portfolio than manually
  entering all of your holdings, trades, and dividends in a spreadsheet?\n\n### Here
  are the top 7 reasons Sharesight is better than a spreadsheet:\n\n1. [Get automatic
  updates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/#get-automatic-updates)\n\n2.
  [Understand your true performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/#understand-your-true-performance)\n\n3.
  [Visualise your portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/#visualise-your-portfolio)\n\n4.
  [Save time and money at tax time](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/#save-time-and-money-at-tax-time)\n\n5.
  [Get email alerts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/#get-email-alerts)\n\n6.
  [Track your cash](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/#track-your-cash)\n\n7.
  [Check your portfolio on the go](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/#check-your-portfolio-on-the-go)\n\n![Sharesight

  1. Get automatic updates\n\nSharesight makes it easy to automatically import your
  holdings from [over 170 brokers around the world](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/).
  Then automatically tracks the performance of your portfolio with daily price & [intraday
  currency fluctuations](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/intraday-foreign-exchange-rates-now-on-sharesight/)
  and incorporates corporate actions such as [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and share splits into your portfolio as they occur. This not only saves you the
  time spent manually updating a spreadsheet, but also reduces the chance of human
  error. Sharesight even lets you [track dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  (DRPs) by automatically calculating the impact of those reinvested dividends — something
  that can get quite tedious if you’ve got a few DRPs going.\n\n## 2. Understand your
  true performance\n\nBy taking into account the impact of things like dividends,
  currency fluctuations and the timing of inflows and outflows on your investment
  portfolio, Sharesight provides you with the complete picture of your portfolio and
  a true understanding of your [investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/).\n\nSharesight
  makes it easy to understand how both your individual holdings and overall portfolio
  are performing. This not only provides peace-of-mind, but it’s also the first step
  to making better investment decisions going forward.\n\n![Sharesight performance

  3. Visualise your portfolio\n\nSharesight’s easy-to-read tables and charts allow
  you to easily visualise your portfolio. One such example is the [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/diversity_report/),
  which lets you quickly assess how your holdings break down in terms of market, industry,
  country, etc. Furthermore, our [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-custom-groups/)
  feature makes it easy to organise your holdings according to your preferred [asset
  allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  methodology. \n\n![Sharesight diversity report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2SES7onNDYSdjorIkxb0LF/0cc9ecb6db8d3999e32e451690c82515/Sharesight_diversity_report.png?w=950)\n\n##
  4. Save time and money at tax time\n\nWith your investment portfolio data all in
  one place and powerful tax reports \navailable in just a couple of clicks, Sharesight
  provides [everything you need to calculate your tax obligations as an investor](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-ways-sharesight-helps-investors-at-tax-time/).
  This is especially useful if you work with an accountant as you’re able to share
  this data with them, rather than paying them to recreate your portfolio history.
  But why not take it a step further and [share portfolio access directly with your
  accountant or financial advisor](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/)?
  You decide whether they have \"read only\" or full access, for one or multiple portfolios,
  and you can withdraw access at any time, making it a much more secure solution than
  emailing a sensitive spreadsheet back and forth. Not only does this give you much
  more control, it also puts you in a position to conduct forward-looking, tax planning
  discussions together – not just at tax-time, but throughout the year.\n\n## 5. Get
  email alerts\n\nDoes your spreadsheet let you know if one of your holdings undergoes
  a major price change? Sharesight does, with optional [email alerts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-sharesight-email-alerts-you-should-enable-today/)
  that notify you if there’s a significant drop or spike in an investment’s price.
  And our popular weekly portfolio email provides a snapshot of how your investments
  have performed over the past week. Together, these email notifications ensure you
  always know how you’re tracking, even if you haven’t had the chance to login to
  your account lately.\n\n![Sharesight email alerts](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/09A65BR3pD9sZhFBwQFzd/d83d86069db154e85738877fe8e53a64/Sharesight_email_alerts.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  6. Track your cash\n\nYour portfolio isn’t the only thing you shouldn’t be tracking
  in a spreadsheet. If you’ve been tracking your cash balances in a spreadsheet rather
  than a dedicated application, you’ll appreciate the financial insights you’ll gain
  by [connecting your portfolio to Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/au/xero/) or using
  [Sharesight’s built-in Cash Account feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/).
  By categorising your bank transactions, reconciling your trade & dividend data,
  and tracking your cash balances alongside your investments, you’ll have a complete
  financial picture of how you’re doing – from anywhere, anytime.\n\n## 7. Check your
  portfolio on the go\n\n[Sharesight’s mobile app](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/introducing-the-sharesight-mobile-app/)
  is a great way to check your portfolio and individual holding performance when you’re
  on the go. Available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sharesight.reader)
  and [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/app/sharesight-Mobile%20App/id1147841214) users,
  the Sharesight Reader mobile app acts as a companion to the main Sharesight website.
  Once you’ve [set up your holdings and trade data](https://help.sharesight.com/au/)
  from your desktop, you can use the free mobile app to track the overall performance
  of your portfolio(s), as well as specific holding information, including capital
  gains, dividends and currency gains. Try doing that with a spreadsheet!\n\n![Sharesight
