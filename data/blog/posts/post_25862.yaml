:title: Xero Cashbook now available via Sharesight
:url_slug: xero-cashbooks-now-available-via-sharesight
:content: "We're thrilled to announce that [Xero Cashbook](/xero/) is now available
  as a bundled add-on with your [Sharesight](/) subscription.\n\nTake a free (seriously
  no strings attached) 30 day trial by clicking the Xero button in the [Plans & Billing
  page](https://help.sharesight.com/changing-plans/) inside your Sharesight Investor
  or Expert plan. If you like what you see, you can continue using Cashbook for $15
  per month. \n\nThis is an industry first. Individuals have never been able to access
  Xero directly without being invited by a professional intermediary. Until now. We're
  the first Add-On Partner with the ability to offer Xero.&nbsp;We're proud they chose
  us to partner with on the back of Sharesight being named [Add-On Partner of the
  Year](/blog/sharesight-wins-xero-add-partner-year/) last month.\n\n![Xero Cashbook
  + Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1zxzQh259ewykAOqISkaUM/b24be377345e0b46138465f72a1b9d48/sharesight-and-xero.png?w=950)\n\n##
  What is Xero Cashbook?\nCashbook is a cut-down version of Xero Partner Edition (the
  product sold to accountants), but with the same core features. With Cashbook you
  can track all of your bank accounts, credit cards, term deposits, even your broker-linked
  cash accounts and margin loans. It's probably the best cash-tracking product in
  the world. You can run reports, share access with your accountant or financial adviser,
  and connect to the Add-Ons in their app store.\n\n## Why do you need Xero Cashbook?\nCashbook
  is the ultimate personal finance tool (in fact, it's so good, small businesses use
  it too). Once you've added your bank accounts, Xero will track all of your incoming
  cash and outgoing expenses. This makes bank reconciliation a one-click process.
  Once you've built up some history, Xero will even begin to suggest auto-reconciliations.
  All of this can be done on their mobile app too (you've probably seen their ads
  at the bus stop). \n\nAnd Sharesight will send your trades and dividends through
  to Xero in real-time, including number of units traded, execution price, brokerage
  fees, and details such as franking credits and tax withheld. This means that your
  investment portfolios are now part of your overall budget and total wealth picture,
  automatically.\n\nOnce you have Xero and Sharesight connected you can also pull
  your cash data back into Sharesight. This is a great way to track cash investments
  inside your Sharesight portfolios.\n\nNow your household P&L, balance sheet, and
  cash flow can be run on the fly, across any date range. Seeing salary alongside
  dividends received and interest earned is awesome. So is tracking brokerage fees,
  and capital gains and losses.\n\nWhen you share access with your accountant or financial
  adviser all of the admin work is done. We have a number of clients doing just this
  for their Self Managed Super Funds too.\n\n## Why are we selling Xero Cashbook?\nBecause
  it's awesome and we're never going to build an accounting application. And because
  we're building an app store of our own for investors. To date we've added brokers,
  a online financial adviser, and an accounting application. More to be announced
  soon...\n\nWe'll continue focusing on investing while Xero focuses on accounting.
  You've heard us bang on before about the power of connected applications. You can
  do so much more across a few tabs in your browser than with one thinly-spread software
  solution. Xero helped define this concept, which runs counter to vertically integrated,
  walled-garden financial service providers.\n\nNow you have a free opportunity to
  see what we're talking about.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2EU60IyGZus\"
