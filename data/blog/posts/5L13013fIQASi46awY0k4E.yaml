:title: SMSF unbundling - how much can it save you in 2017?
:content: "We’ve written before about the concept of [SMSF Unbundling](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  -- but much has changed in the three years since [Sharesight CEO Doug Morris](https://twitter.com/doug_sharesight)
  wrote his original [SMSF unbundling blog](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-unbundling-and-how-much-can-it-save-me/)
  post. So we thought it would be useful to revisit and update the numbers behind
  SMSF unbundling in 2017.\n\n## What is unbundling?\n\nThere was a time that it made
  financial sense to bundle all of our financial service products together with a
  single institution -- ie: buying our insurance from the same bank we hold our home
  loan with, who we’ve also held a savings account with for most of our lives.  \n\nUnbundling
  refers to the process of moving away from these monolithic, expensive, vertically
  integrated financial products and building your own “unbundled” solution -- connecting
  products from across the [fintech ecosystem](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/where-sharesight-fits-in-fintech-australias-ecosystem-map/)
  to achieve the same outcomes -- usually for a fraction of the cost.\n\n>If you think
  of traditional financial services as being a vertical column of children’s Jenga
  blocks. Fintech has disrupted the tower of blocks, toppling it over so consumers
  now can build their own financial services solutions from a marketplace to meet
  their needs – just like an app store.” - Doug Morris [‘Why you should partner with
  Sharesight’](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/why-you-should-partner-with-sharesight/)\n\n##
  The unbundled SMSF solution\n\nThere are four ‘problems’ an unbundled SMSF solution
  needs to solve: \n\n1. **Execution:** The actual buy/sell transactions of investing.
  \n2. **Accounting:** Ensuring your SMSF meets compliance requirements of Australian
  SMSF legislation.\n3. **Research:** Choosing shares, funds, or other investments
  based on your investment strategy (the part you will probably spend the most time
  on if you unbundle).\n4. **Portfolio tracking:** Tracking how your SMSF portfolio
  is performing against your investment strategy.\n\n![featured unbundled-smsf](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4VSdZA6Q7K64kW4OQkso8g/dbc65004afb56d145edc7ebb684eabb6/featured_unbundled-smsf.png?w=950)\n\nLet’s
  see how an SMSF trustee with a $500,000 portfolio might tackle these four problems
  if they used an unbundled SMSF solution compared to the traditional bundle.\n\n###
  Execution -- CMC Markets\n\nCMC Markets charge $11 per trade for their entry-level
  service. So let’s assume for this example that this SMSF trustee is turning over
  20% of the shares in their portfolio of 50 holdings each year, that’s 40 trades
  ($440 over the year). Plus, let’s assume that 50% of this trustee’s SMSF is allocated
  to Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which carry their own management fees (typically
  in the range of 0.2% to 0.5%, so let’s use the [Vanguard MSCI Australian Small Companies
  Index ETF](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/adviser/adv/investments/product.html#/productType=etf)
  rate of 0.3% --  so $750).\n\n### Accounting -- Xero + Accountant\n\nFor this piece
  of the unbundled SMSF puzzle, you’ll need a cloud accounting solution such as [Xero
  Cashbook](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/) ($15/m or $180/y). Then you can share
  your Xero account details with your accountant who will need to sign-off on your
  numbers at end of year. The accounting fee will vary depending on the complexity
  of your financial situation, but let’s assume $1,500 for this example.\n\n### Research
  -- The Motley Fool\n\nThe Motley Fool offers a number of investment research products,
  but their core product, [Share Advisor](https://www.fool.com.au/order/retailsa/)
  is a great place to start. The $399/y subscription unlocks a number of Australian
  and international share recommendations/reports each year and includes access to
  their investment community. \n\n### Portfolio Tracking -- Sharesight\n\n[Sharesight](/)
  not only your tracks and reports on your portfolio’s performance, it is indispensable
  for all SMSF trustees. The Sharesight asset allocation and custom groups features
  help trustees prepare their [investment strategy documentation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  each year with their accountant. \n\nSharesight can also connect your SMSF to both
  CMC and Xero, which means that every trade made in CMC will be recorded in Sharesight,
  and appear in Xero, in real time. It’s only $25/m or $275/y for the [Sharesight
  Investor plan](https://www.sharesight.com/au/pricing/) (plus the Xero Cashbook subscription,
  listed above).\n\n**Unbundled SMSF solution total (On a $500,000 portfolio): <span
  style=\"color:red\">$3,654 -- or a MER (Management Expense Ratio) of 0.73%</span>**\n\n###

  An SMSF investment platform bundle \n\nA bundled SMSF solution will typically be
  based on what is called an SMSF investment platform, or alternatively an SMSF wrap
  account. This will bundle together the execution, research and tracking components
  (you’ll still need an accountant) together for you. But this comes at a cost, with
  bundled solutions charging fees for administration, adviser fees, dealer fees and
  fees on the assets you have under management. \n\nWith our $500,000 example from
  above, using pretty conservative figures:\n\n- You’ll see between 0.5% and 2% of
  invested assets lost each year to the SMSF investment platform or wrap in administration
  costs (let’s use [Macquarie Wrap Accumulator](http://www.macquarie.com/au/advisers/solutions/wrap)
  for our example, which charges 0.62%).\n- Your financial adviser will then usually
  charge an ongoing ‘advice fee’ + a fee to to get your money ‘on’ an SMSF platform,
  which is usually negotiated between you and your adviser (usually this fee runs
  to about 1% of invested assets -- so in this case, $5,000 of your $500,000).\n-
  Then the financial adviser’s dealer, firm or licensee will take a slice of the action
  (in the region of 0.2% to 0.5% -- let’s use 0.2% here).\n- Then you’ll incur fees
  on the actual amounts invested, depending on the investment products chosen (such
  as actively managed funds or SMAs). In this example, 50% of the portfolio is invested
  in actively managed funds -- which typically charge between 0.75% and 1.5%. Using
  0.92% (which is what Macquarie Master Balanced Fund charges) these fees will eat
  $2,300 of your $500,000. \n- Just like the unbundled solution, you’ll still need
  to pay an accountant, but in this case the accountant will incur additional fees
  for SMSF software like Class to do the part that Sharesight + Xero does (this increases
  your accounting cost to $2000).\n\n**The SMSF investment platform bundle cost with
  $500,000 invested: <span style=\"color:red\">$13,400 (MER of 2.68%) ‘lost’ yearly</span>**\n\n###
  Bundled SMSF costs breakdown\n\n|What?|Who?|How Much?|\n|--------|:-------:|--------:|\n|Administration|SMSF
  Platform/Wrap|$3,100|\n|Advice Fee|Financial Adviser|$5,000|\n|Dealer Fee|Dealer/Licensee|$1,000|\n|Investment
  Products|Fund Manager|$2,300|\n|Accounting|Accountant|$2000|\n|**Bundled SMSF**|**Total**|**$13,400**|\n\n##
  SMSF investment platforms - a raw deal\n\nIf we assume a reasonable return of 8%
  per year on that $500,000 SMSF investment, that 2.68% fee represents 34% of your
  profit lost to costs for bundling. Compare that with only 0.73% for a comparable
  unbundled solution. The choice to unbundle your SMSF suddenly becomes clear.\n\nUnbundling
  is of course, not for everyone. But for those willing to build their own unbundled
  [SMSF solution using Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  like investor Andrew Bird the benefits are clear.\n\nDo you run your own SMSF? Do
  you use an SMSF platform or have you built your own unbundled SMSF like the one
