  In this Sharesight20ASX weekly snapshot of Sharesight users' 20 most traded stocks on the ASX, Zip Co (ASX: Z1P) strongly led the sell trades, with many investors likely selling shares off the back of [preliminary FY20 results](https://themarketherald.com.au/zip-cos-asxz1p-growth-focus-contributes-to-44-9m-fy20-loss-2020-08-27/) showing a 61% increase in net bad debts and losses of $44.9 million, as the company chases expansion plans. However, Zip also strongly led the buy trades, with share prices soaring following the announcement of a [partnership with eBay](https://themarketherald.com.au/zip-co-asxz1p-launches-zip-business-with-ebay-partnership-2020-08-26/). Rival BNPL giant Afterpay (ASX: APT) was another popular buy and sell trade, as well as data company Appen (ASX: APX).
