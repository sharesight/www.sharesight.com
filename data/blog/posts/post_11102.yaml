  **Tip #1 &mdash; Why you should invest in the share market**

  Innumerable studies have shown that over the longer term the share market will generally outperform other forms of investment.

  “Over the long term” is a very important qualifier because you should only invest money in the share market that you will not need in the short/medium term. If you need your money at short notice, you run the risk of having to sell when markets are low, which could crystallise unnecessary losses for you. So don’t invest money in the share market unless you are confident you are not going to need it at a particular time in the future in case that time coincides with a slump in share prices.
