:title: ASX mFund distribution data now available in Sharesight
:url_slug: asx-mfund-distribution-data-now-available-in-sharesight
:content: "In order to improve the experience for investors that hold mFund investments,
  we have worked with the ASX to source and display mFund distribution data directly
  within Sharesight. The mFund settlement service allows investors to access unlisted
  managed funds through the ASX, and investors have been [able to track mFund unit
  prices in Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/asx-mfund-now-available-on-sharesight/)
  since the product launched in 2014.\n\n![ASX mFund distribution data now available
  in Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7og5CvyxT4TCirLs8NXuks/bf4a55256494240be4ad841cfbbe419d/ASX_mFund_distribution_data_now_available_in_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\nNow
  Sharesight users will be able to see the total return on mFund holdings, including
  the impact of dividends and distributions on their performance, like they do for
  shares and managed funds. The addition of these distributions will enhance the experience
  of investors who access these managed funds via the ASX.\n\n## What is an mFund?\n\nAn
  mFund is an unlisted actively managed fund that is available to an investor through
  the settlement process of the ASX and is governed by the ASX's operating rules.
  mFund offers investors a wide variety of managed funds in a paperless format, giving
  them exposure to a wide range of asset classes and investment themes. To date, there
  are over 200 mFund listings on the market.\n\nA [number of brokers](https://www.asx.com.au/mfund/mfund-partners.htm#tabs-218)
  support and enable investors to buy and sell mFund holdings, including a number
  of broker partners of Sharesight such as [CMC Markets](https://www.sharesight.com/au/partners/cmc/).\n\n##
  Track your mFund holdings in Sharesight\n\nWith Sharesight, investors who hold mFund
  holdings may now view their total return alongside their other ASX (and non-ASX)
  investments such as shares and ETFs, giving them a holistic view of their investments.
  \n\n*\"We welcome the new development by Sharesight to add distribution data for
  mFund to their platform. This new feature enhances an investor’s overall view of
  their portfolio and improves their experience when building portfolios using the
  products that are available on ASX\" says Rory Cunnigham, Senior Manager, Investment
  Products at ASX.*\n\nWe are now auto-populating corporate actions (dividends and
  distributions) for mFund instruments in Sharesight. Historical mFund distributions
  will be displayed under the corporate actions tab on each mFund holding.\n\n![mfund

  forward, all future mFund distributions will appear as unconfirmed payouts as with
  any other type of instrument.\n\n![mFund distributions in Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5iAK3rtTOMrwb1a8jlygNN/7d97621a0189268078648a86746825fb/mFund_distributions_in_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Distributions
