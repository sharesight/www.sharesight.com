  should track your global stocks with Sharesight\n\nWith support for over [40 leading
  global markets](https://www.sharesight.com/au/faq/#which-stock-exchanges-does-sharesight-support)
  and the ability to track the price and performance of investments across different
  asset classes, markets, currencies and [brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/),
  Sharesight is the ultimate portfolio tracker for anyone who owns global investments.\n\nUnlike
  the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight takes into account the impact of capital
  gains, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/), brokerage fees
  and currency fluctuations when calculating returns – giving investors the full picture
  of their portfolio’s performance. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports
  for self-directed investors including Performance, Portfolio Diversity, Contribution
  Analysis, and Multi-Currency Valuation. The ability to track cash accounts, property
  and even cryptocurrency is just another reason that investors should consider using
  Sharesight to track their investment portfolio.\n\n### Multi-Currency Valuation\n\nWith
  Sharesight’s [Multi-Currency Valuation Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/),
  investors can clearly see the value of their investments denominated in the currency
  of their choice. This is useful for global investors and expats who \"think\" in
  another currency outside of the currency of their tax residency. A US expat living
  in the UK may wish to see the value of their portfolio denominated in USD, for example.
  \n\n### Portfolio Diversity\n\nSharesight’s [Portfolio Diversity Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculate-investment-portfolio-diversification-sharesight/)
  is an easy way for investors to calculate the diversification of their portfolio
  at any point in time. The report gives investors a breakdown of their portfolio’s
  asset allocation based on the classifications of their choice, and could be used
  to see how much a portfolio is weighted towards different markets, for instance.
  \n\n## How to track your global stocks with Sharesight\n\n1. If you’re not using
  Sharesight yet, sign up for a [FREE account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
  to get started.\n\n2. Add your holdings to your portfolio by searching for the relevant
  stock code under the appropriate market code (eg. NASDAQ: AAPL). Alternatively,
  you can add holdings through Sharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  or [File Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  features.\n\n3. Sharesight will automatically fill in the price history and performance
  valuation for your holdings throughout the day or daily by end-of-day, [depending
  on the market](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/).
  It will also backfill past dividends (and continue to add new ones as they are announced)
  – plus factor in the impact of any currency fluctuations on your performance.\n\n![globalportfolio
