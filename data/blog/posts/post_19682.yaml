:url_slug: managed-funds-live-on-sharesight
:content: "With Sharesight, investors can track the price and performance of **over
  12,000 Australian managed funds and mFunds**, plus **more than 700 New Zealand funds**,
  along with support for thousands of other global funds, stocks and ETFs. This makes
  it easy for Australian and New Zealand investors to track managed funds along with
  all the rest of their investments, while taking advantage of Sharesight’s award-winning
  performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. To learn more about how you can track Australian and
  New Zealand managed funds with Sharesight, keep reading. \n\n![AUNZ managed funds

  Why investors should track managed funds with Sharesight\n\nSharesight users can
  automatically track thousands of Australian and New Zealand funds, including corporate
  superannuation, wholesale trusts, pension funds, [Kiwisaver](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-do-i-track-my-kiwisaver-fund/)
  funds and even some superannuation pension funds. And unlike some legacy offline
  portfolio systems, there is no extra charge for managed fund data. This means investors
  can easily track the performance of their managed fund investments along with the
  rest of their portfolio. Investors will also benefit from the ability to [seamlessly
  connect to Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/), allowing managed fund data to
  automatically flow through to their Sharesight portfolio. \n\n![BT-Platinum example](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1zg8iNFIRZdzPVjtsed6Pl/a889effc9f12a24da43982c1043fb570/BT-Platinum_example.jpg?w=950)\n\n###
  Easily handle Australian Managed Investment Trust (AMIT) tax calculations\n\nSome
  Australian managed funds are classed as Australian Managed Investment Trusts (AMIT).
  This creates additional tax implications for investors, particularly around the
  treatment of tax-deferred income. Sharesight makes it easier for self-directed investors
  to handle [AMIT tax calculations](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  by offering custom fields that allow AMIT unit holders to correctly record the Trust
  Income components for these investments. This includes fields for the new (2018)
  AMIT cost base decrease, and AMIT cost base increase adjustments which feed into
  Sharesight’s [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  calculations and the [Taxable Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report/)
  for Australians completing their *Tax Return for Individuals* form.\n\nSee our [blog
  post](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  for more information on AMIT tax calculations. \n\n## How to track managed funds
  in Sharesight \n\n1. Sign up for a FREE [Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)

  valuations of your holdings from their listed market to your portfolio’s base currency.
  It also automatically calculates any currency fluctuations on a daily basis and
  backfills past distributions (and continues to add new ones as they are announced).\n\n![track
