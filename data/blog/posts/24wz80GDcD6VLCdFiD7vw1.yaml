:title: How I use Sharesight as an investor
:url_slug: how-i-use-sharesight-as-an-investor
:content: "As a keen DIY investor, I was attracted to Sharesight (as a user, and now,
  investor) by its clear and powerful functionality, and its focus on investors alike,
  who want to take control of their investments and save on the costs of investing,
  but who also have better things to do with their time than track down missing dividend
  payments.\n\nI use Sharesight personally every day and I can truly say it has transformed
  my investing experience. I have gained great insight into how I am performing and
  saved many thousands of dollars in fees over time from the way I used to manage
  my investments.\n\nHere are some of my suggestions to get the most out of Sharesight:
  \n\n![How I use Shaersight as an investor](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5olAYz9RDWfIVLu61JonaP/b91b3d6fb202c3c274efb4f31bdc2387/How_I_use_Shaersight_as_an_investor.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Import ALL of your holdings\n\nIt’s essential to get an accurate picture of your
  portfolio and your returns. It can be a bit of work at the beginning, but once set
  up it’s largely automated. I use the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  feature for my Australian broker and it works very reliably. I also use a US broker
  which doesn’t send trade confirmation emails, but I can use the [File Importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  to import trades in bulk my Sharesight portfolio. \n\n![Trade confirmation emails](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4Hr50EljXdP7kMKSpYRu5/cd6765ba3ef25024ea6fae2899a7b2e8/Trade_confrimation_emails.png?w=950)\n\nNot
  only do I track listed investments, but I also have some private unlisted investments
  ([such as property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/))
  which I track as [Custom Investments](https://help.sharesight.com/unquoted-instruments/).
  I have to manually update the prices, but for my purposes that doesn’t need to be
  done very often. The custom investment feature is a really useful way of tracking
  all my investments in one place.\n\n## Benchmark your portfolio\n\nBecause I'm in
  Australia I track my [investments against STW](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/),
  which is an ETF covering the top 200 stocks on the ASX. However, if I wanted to
  compare my performance to a common US index tracking ETF I might benchmark against
  the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: IVV) or the Nasdaq
  tracking Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ).\n\n[Benchmarking](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/)
  your portfolio is vital so you can see how successful your stock picks and decisions
  are. Making a 10% return is good, but if the market went up 15% (and you could have
  achieved this return by buying a suitable ETF covering the market) then you need
  to think about how you can improve your performance going forward.\n\n![SPY benchmark](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/Rhv71b7lsI7OgN4lX5rI5/2be8d2307245a9a371ae2cb28cca9255/SPY_benchmark.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Set up some Custom Groups\n\nI use this feature to track my returns by different
  asset classes. The beauty of [Custom Groups](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  is that you can organise your portfolio in a way that is meaningful to you rather
  than having to use predefined ones which often are not that relevant. Basically,
  I track my share portfolio using 5 groups:\n\n1. Domestic active: These are domestic
  listed shares I pick myself and manage actively\n\n2. Domestic passive: Passive
  ETFs that track a domestic stock market index\n\n3. International Active: This is
  a mixture of international active managed funds and individual stocks that I pick\n\n4.
  International passive: International ETFs that are tracking an index\n\n5. Fixed
  interest: Bond funds primarily\n\nWith this grouping I can easily see how each area
  is performing and how it makes up my overall portfolio. I can see if my own stock
  picking is adding value, versus the index or a more passive investment approach.
  By running the [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/)
  I can also see the percentage in each category to make sure I am staying within
  sensible limits on each.\n\n## Learn how I use Sharesight in this webinar\n\nFor

  Sharesight\n\nGetting the most out of [Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com)
