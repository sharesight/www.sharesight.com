:title: ASX-300 sector and stock performance 2013-2018
:url_slug: asx-300-sector-and-stock-performance-2013-2018
:content: "Since investors using Sharesight typically tend to lean towards a [‘buy
  and hold’ investing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-reasons-why-buy-and-hold-investors-use-sharesight/)
  philosophy, it’s important to look at returns over longer periods. In this post,
  we’re examining the returns of stocks in [Australia’s ASX-300 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P/ASX_300)
  and the corresponding returns for each sector as well as key stocks to look for
  underlying trends over the last 5 years (2013-2018).\n\n## Sharesight performance
  calculation methodology\n\nSharesight calculates *annualised* returns that *include
  dividends* - we do this using a [dollar weighted return](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/)
  calculation method when there are multiple buy/sell trades within a measurement
  period. For this exercise we \"purchased\" a single parcel of each stock on 1 Jan
  \ 2013 and used [Sharesight’s performance report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  to calculate the annualised return including dividends (total annualised return)
  through to 31 December 2018. In this post we've used [Sharesight's compounded annual
  return](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/) to calculate
  these annualised returns.\n\n## ASX-300 performance 2013-2018 \n\n![ASX300 historical
  performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4fOCpWkdJUqunPBGTOURLh/5f7070160c512be8076960f4a1c9300c/ASX300_historical_performance.png?w=950)\n\nUsing
  the [Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (VAS)](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8205/?overview)
  as a proxy to capture the dividend and capital gain performance of the ASX-300 index
  in Sharesight (read our [rationale for benchmarking your portfolio against ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)),
  we find an extremely strong performance for the index through 2013 before a long
  plateau, underpinning the importance of understanding the impact of [holding periods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiod.asp)
  in your investment performance.\n\nOver the 5 years from 1 January 2013 to 31 December
  2018, ASX:VAS recorded a 9.93% total annual return, with 6.95% of that return coming
  from dividends, illustrating the high dividend yield common to some Australian stocks.\n\n##
  Performance of each sector in the ASX-300\n\nSharesight uses the [FactSet Revere
  Business Industry Classification System](https://open.factset.com/products/factset-rbics/en-us)
  to classify companies by industry and sector (when looking at a holding in Sharesight,
  this information is available in the ‘instrument detail’ section on the right).\n\n![ASX300
  sector performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4q5eSHEXdKvKhFNnDmXank/3e2b960249c53af685df8ff3d87b0b77/ASX300_sector_performance.png?w=950)\n\nWe
  used this sector break down to split out the performance by sector within the ASX-300
  over the 2013-2018 period. Here’s that performance by sector -- simply click on
