:title: How Sharesight makes ETF tax admin easy
:content: "[Sharesight](/) makes tax time easy, and with our new and improved handling
  of ETF distributions and more powerful Australian Taxable Income Report, things
  just got even easier.\n\n## ETFs are an admin headache at tax time\n\n[ETFs (Exchange
  Traded Funds)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) are a type of investment
  fund that can be bought and sold on stock exchanges. These funds issue distributions
  (in essence, ‘dividends’) to shareholders throughout the financial year for any
  income earned by the fund. ETFs are structured as unit trusts, which impacts how
  the income earned (dividends, realised capital gains, interest, etc) is split across
  different categories for reporting purposes. This increases the complexity of completing
  your tax return for the Australian Tax Office (ATO).\n\nHere is an ETF income distribution
  statement for a popular ASX-listed ETF (VAS.ASX - Vanguard Australian Shares Index
  ETF). Just look at that complexity:\n\n![VAS tax statement for forum](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6rJOSdqpNeo26WK2ccgYKU/b3607f66474de309398f8bee173c7341/VAS_tax_statement_for_forum.PNG)\n\n##
  How Sharesight makes ETF tax admin easy\n\nThroughout the year, ETF managers will
  typically provide quarterly income distribution estimates from their operations.
  These are already automatically captured by Sharesight, but as these are estimates,
  they need reconciling against the year-end income statement provided by the ETF
  manager.\n\nWe’ve made significant improvements in how Sharesight handles the data
  underpinning ETF income distributions and how we report these for Australian investors.
  Read on for the details:\n\n### Default all ETF distributions to Trust Income\n\nWe’ve
  updated the way we handle ETF distribution income to consider it ‘trust income’
  by default. This change is really important, because distributions from ETFs for
  Australian investors need to be recorded in ‘Section 13 - Partnerships and Trusts’
  of the *income tax return for individuals (supplementary section)*, which differs
  from ordinary dividend and interest income which would be entered in the standard
  *tax return for individuals* - in Section 10 (interest) and Section 11 (dividends).\n\n![Edit

  Fields for all required ETF distribution components\n\nWe’ve updated the fields
  available for recording a payment within a holding to include all the fields investors
  need to accurately record their ETF distributions. \n\n![Edit a Payment VAS ETF](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/41ACXM5YEwGgseUUOuegce/d441011634b78dcfea48d0e7502a3910/Edit_a_Payment_VAS_ETF.png?w=950)\n\n###
  We get end of year ETF income distribution details directly from Computershare\n\n(Hey
  [Link Market Services](https://www.linkmarketservices.com.au/) and [BoardRoom](https://boardroomlimited.com.au/),
  we would love to get this data from you too!)\n\nEnd of year component details from
  [Computershare](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/computershare/) for FY2016/17
  are now available within Sharesight. We hope to have FY2017/18 data loaded as soon
  as it is available (likely August) - saving you the time required to enter these
  from your end of year income statements.\n\n### We tell you if ETF distributions
  are incomplete\n\nWe now display a warning icon alongside unconfirmed transactions
  for each ETF payout where the components that make up the distribution have not
  been finalised at year end. There has been some confusion in the past over whether
  the quarterly ETF income figures were correct, and as these are only estimates,we
  now clearly indicate when this occurs in order to avoid any confusion.\n\n![ETF
  Distributions](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1aVgJsSfBOE8csQK0kImMO/2575879af5061924ae6e4fb935d303d5/ETF_Distributions.png?w=950)\n\n###
  We even tell you when end of year tax details are available\n\nAs soon as end of
  financial year component details are available, we now display an alert against
  the distributions involved so you can action the information.\n\n![End of year ETF
  Distributions](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3eOE7d9SIEAsqISsIWAMMK/25324181a0cb034e5fdd1c23a7ecbd22/End_of_year_ETF_Distributions.png?w=950)\n\n###
  We also make it simple to update your distribution with end of year details\n\nFinal
  distribution details can differ from quarterly estimates - so we’ve made it easy
  to reset a confirmed payout if you’ve confirmed it during the year and it doesn’t
  match the end of financial year taxation statement.\n\n![Edit end of year distrubutions](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4XmnGepa64OOuy2CkwgGe2/4f47b97000e82c7b7e4f5a782951d360/Edit_end_of_year_distrubutions.png?w=950)\n\n###
  ETF distributions are correctly attributed to the year they are earned\n\nIf an
  ETF distribution is paid in (for example) July, but the distribution payment is
  for income earned by the ETF in the previous financial year, it needs to be included
  in the previous financial year on your Australian income tax return. We’ve improved
  the way we handle this, in many cases handling it automatically.\n\n![ETF distribution
