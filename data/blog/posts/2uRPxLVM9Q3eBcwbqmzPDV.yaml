:title: Australia's Consumer Data Right to open banking
:content: "In collaboration with Fintech Australia, Sharesight has officially endorsed
  a [submission](https://assets.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5KVR27n09hcvPDVwL8inqQ/f1225fe75764d0190e3773e1e1aa103f/CDR_-_Treasury_Submission_Final.pdf)
  on the  Treasury Laws Amendment [(Consumer Data Right) Bill 2019](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/TLABConsumerDataRight)
  that seeks to create the Consumer Data Right (CDR) with an amendment to the Competition
  and Consumer Act 2010.\n\nThe[ Consumer Data Right (CDR)](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0)
  will mandate that banks and financial institutions (before later extending to telecommunications
  and utility providers) make it easy, safe, and practical for consumers to share
  their data with third parties — including competing services. It’s one of several
  critical ingredients needed to improve the financial outcome for Australians. Open
  Banking initiatives are already in place in the [UK](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/why-australia-needs-open-banking-like-the-uk/),
  and progress is being made in [Canada](https://www.fin.gc.ca/activty/consult/2019/ob-bo/obbo-report-rapport-eng.asp)
  and [New Zealand](https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/financial-stability/financial-stability-report/fsr-may-2018/an-open-mind-on-open-banking).\n\n##
  Banks hate the CDR \n\nMany countries (Australia especially) have banking oligopolies,
  and no one wants to be responsible for killing the golden goose. Banks know that
  keeping clients inside their walled gardens is key to revenue growth by upselling
  them products like financial advice and mortgages. Just this week, I opened a \"high\"
  interest savings account with my incumbent bank in literally 3 mouse clicks — it
  works.\n\n![featured open-banking (1)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7b5et6DofdcMJHLHI7pDBi/b8fb71e65cab2749bbc0a0c7ddda774b/featured_open-banking__1_.png?w=950)\n\nHistorically,
  banks benefited from the fact that switching was way too painful for the average
  client. [Open Banking](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/open-banking-changes-in-australia/)
  threatens that because it builds the plumbing required to make switching easy. It
  will be like signing into something with your Google account. Ironically, banks
  have only come to understand that customer data is an asset once fintechs build
  clever ways of extracting that data.\n\n## Consumer data right is progress\n\nWe’re
  excited about the progress made. Eventually, Open Banking will make it easier for
  you to control access to your online brokerage and share registry data, which in
  turn means more investors can shop for better services, and use software solutions
  like [Sharesight](/). This is a relatively minor use case. Open Banking could eventually
  have mass impact on the superannuation and everyday banking markets.\n\n## CDR legislation
  is only the first step\n\nThe CDR is not a panacea. The old saying in software goes,
  80% of people use 20% of your product. I’d argue that ratio will be more like 98%
  to 2% when Open Banking debuts.\n\nI don’t mean to throw cold water on an initiative
  we believe in. But think about it this way: If I bury a feature within a settings
  menu, and that settings menu lives within an advanced settings menu, which lives
  in a system preferences menu… how many people will be motivated to seek this feature
  out? The banks will bury their government-mandated [Open Banking ](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/open-banking-changes-in-australia/)settings
  the same way.\n\nThe key to making this work is financial education. Yes, fintechs
  provide better alternatives, but missing is the broad consumer demand and knowledge
  that challenger companies will save them money.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n* [Open
