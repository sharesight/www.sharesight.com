:url_slug: every-new-feature-improvement-sharesight-released-in-2019
:content: "Last year was another big year at Sharesight, we reached [over 100,000
  users](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-hits-100000-users/) and month
  after month we released new features and improvements to make Sharesight better
  than ever. \n\nWhile not every new feature release gets its own blog post to explain
  it, they are all covered in our [monthly release notes](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/release-notes/)
  so you can stay up to date with the latest improvements. \n\nWith 2019 now behind
  us, let's revisit everything we released during the year.\n\n![Every new feature
  + improvement Sharesight released in 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/71jqRziqjgmzoTfYXnCJYd/4d682902b11a48ac34c777f3daa0c17f/Every_new_feature___improvement_Sharesight_released_in_2019.jpg?w=950)\n\n#

  customers ahead of general release in the coming weeks.\n\n* Redesigned Billing
  Details page to provide quicker and clearer access to billing information and invoice
  history.\n\n* Improve Contract Note / Trade Confirmation Email Password field in
  the settings tab to clearly indicate when a password has been saved.\n\n* Performance

  Report along with various layout improvements.\n\n## Security\n- Require confirmation
  of existing password when changing password.\n- Introduce Content Security Policy
  headers as further protection against cross site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and

  a minor layout change to the criteria selection on the [Portfolio Overview](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/)
  and [Individual Holding](https://help.sharesight.com/show_holding/) pages in preparation
  for some final overview changes coming in April.\n\n* Gmail users can set their
  [broker email import](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) address as a

  from within the [Contract Note Inbox](https://help.sharesight.com/viewing-the-contract-notes-inbox/).\n\n*

  March\n\n## Usability\n\n* Following overwhelmingly positive feedback from our beta

  don’t have to scroll up to the top of the page to alter the report settings. This

  switches for closed positions and dollar/percentage selection. This is much easier
  to use on touchscreens in particular.\n\n* Added thumbnail icons to the chart selection
  dropdown.\n\n* A range of small usability tweaks to the add holding form, including
  a smarter way to pre-fill the exchange rate for foreign investments.\n\n* Substantial

  users will not need to manually update their ETF distribution components from their
  AMMA statement using [Sharesight’s pro-rata form](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/taxable_income/#1)
  to add this information to their portfolio.\n\n* We now allow you to override the
  foreign withholding tax rate individually against each foreign holding in your portfolio.
  You’ll find this under ‘holding settings’ on the holding page. \n\n* For Australian
