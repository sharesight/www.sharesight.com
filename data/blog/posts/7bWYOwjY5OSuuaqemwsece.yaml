:title: Calculate your capital gains tax (without a spreadsheet or calculator)
:content: "###### NOTE: There is a newer version of this article. See [*Capital gains
  tax calculator for Australian investors*](/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  for more information.\n\nSmash your calculator. [Ditch the spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/).
  The best way to calculate your investment portfolio’s CGT obligations is to use
  [Sharesight](/)’s Capital Gains Tax Report. Here’s why:\n\n- **It takes care of
  the maths** (so you don’t have to).\n- **It makes it easy to optimise your tax position**
  by letting you experiment with different sale allocation methods.\n- **You can run
  the report at any time, over any time period.** So not only will you have the information
  you need at tax time, but throughout the year. This means fewer surprises when the
  next tax season rolls around.\n\n**Our Australian Capital Gains Tax Report calculates
  capital gains made on shares as per Australian Tax Office rules** (for those of
  you in Canada, we also offer a [Canadian CGT Report](/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report/)).
  The report is based on the ‘discount method’ for shares that were held for more
  than one year and the ‘other method’ for shares held for less than one year (more
  on that below).\n\n![featured - calculator - smashed](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1lsxCoDTs4uKck660EOU6u/59dc24a51cbeb28bb786f543397ea0ad/featured_calculator-smashed.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How to calculate your CGT\n\n### 1 -- [Sign-up for a Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)\nJoin
  the tens of thousands of DIY investors already taking control of their portfolio
  with Sharesight. You can track up to 10 holdings for FREE!\n\n### 2 -- Import your
  holdings\nYou may add your holdings manually, by spreadsheet (CSV) or via a one-time
  connection to your online broker:\n![screenshot - add holding](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3kh8sYf61yWEOq620wwQaa/3cb694240e5dd7f92f7b3836cee64920/screenshot_add-holding.png?w=950)\n\n###
  3 -- Confirm your tax settings\nBecause Sharesight lets you track multiple portfolios
  (tax entities), you’ll want to confirm/update your portfolio’s discount rate before
  running the CGT Report. To do that, go to Settings > Tax Settings:\n![screenshot
  - tax settings](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/597jZ462PuyIIOUGgIKsm0/2ddfe242f73da8f550f509b0a6abe9b3/screenshot_tax-settings.png?w=950)\n\n###
  4 -- Run the Capital Gains Tax Report\nFrom the Reports menu, select the Capital
  Gains Tax Report:\n![screenshot - reports - cgt](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4nXsSdYIcMSimgi0CiAkY4/7be243839243c08f5599dab112518211/screenshot_reports-cgt.png?w=950)\n\n###
  5 -- Select your date range\nEnter a custom date range or select from a preset option,
  including the current or last financial year:\n![screenshot - cgt report - date
  range](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5rL3YVOe9GAys02E0wIWou/9ffc82613f1afef53af13d8dbf80cfaf/screenshot_cgt-report_date.png?w=950)\n\n###
  6 -- Review your CGT report\nThe Capital Gains Tax Report breaks down:\n\n- Short
  Term Capital Gains (assets bought and sold within one year or less)\n- Long Term
  Capital Gains\n- Capital Losses\n\n![screenshot - cgt report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/77ExZnqiR2Q0I0imy4igQA/955c9abcc8873a7be01dbfed5ade8abe/screenshot_cgt-report.png?w=950)\nIt
  also includes a helpful summary:\n![screenshot - cgt report - summary](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/479S2ijRPi8uAq6iEiYA0E/b75040109e9cddf85cc57e7bfa3237c1/screenshot_cgt-report_summary.png?w=950)\n\n###
  7 -- Set your prefered sale allocation method\n\nYou can experiment with different
  sale allocation methods in order to optimise your CGT position. Choose from:\n\n-
  FIFO (First In, First Out)\n- LIFO (Last In, First Out)\n- Maximise Gain\n- Minimise
  Gain\n- Minimise CGT\n\nThe “Minimise CGT” option is handy. We’ll assume that you
  sell shares resulting in the lowest capital gains tax first. This method is more
  sophisticated than the “Minimise Gain” method because it takes into account the
  discounting rules. Note that the sales allocation method can be changed for specific
  holdings or for the entire portfolio:\n![screenshot - cgt report - sale allocation
  methods](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5Fig4Qu4LYOUIwYIYE0Icq/e692762bb8eb10d9d87ab625037d45b1/screenshot_cgt-report_sale-allocation.png?w=950)\n\n###
  8 -- Carry forward your losses\nYou may also choose to carry forward any losses
  from the previous reporting period:\n![screenshot - cgt report - carry-forward losses](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1xZXHQT8rCOWOKwq6UKKKa/5607d9dcd6b442bc1fa3ca15e5b4a6ee/screenshot_cgt-report_carry-forward-losses.png?w=950)\n\n###
  9 -- Lock it up\nOnce you’re happy with your report, you may choose to “lock” it.
  This allows you to alter the sale allocation methods in future reporting periods
  without invalidating the result for previous periods:\n![screenshot - cgt report
  - lock](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2GgiGSsyWcYO2WKAgmUsIy/4e43b10e653873c1cedd0c37049610a9/screenshot_cgt-report_lock.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Want more?\n\n- **Download your CGT report** -- As with all of Sharesight’s reports,
  your entire Capital Gains Tax Report can be downloaded to Excel, PDF or [Google
  Sheets](/blog/new-open-sharesight-reports-directly-google-sheets/).\n- **Take advantage
  of tax loss selling** -- The [Unrealised CGT Report](/blog/tax-loss-selling-for-australian-investors/)
  makes it easy to lower your capital gain tax obligations by letting you model the
  implications of tax loss selling (tax harvesting).\n- **Share access with your accountant**
  -- With your capital gains and losses automatically sorted, you should save on accounting
  fees this tax season. Why not take it a step further by [securely sharing your portfolio
  with your accountant](/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/)?
  They’ll have everything they need at their fingertips -- not just at tax-time but
  throughout the year.\n \n## Need help?\nFor more information visit our [Capital
