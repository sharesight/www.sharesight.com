:url_slug: easily-import-trades-from-nabtrade-into-sharesight
:content: "Getting started with Sharesight is now easier than ever with the ability
  to automatically import trades from [over 170 brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  into your Sharesight portfolio. An effortless way of keeping your portfolio up-to-date,
  investors can automatically record historic and ongoing buy and sell trades through
  the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/) sent
  when trading with most brokers.\n\n[nabtrade](https://www.nabtrade.com.au/investor/home/)
  is one of the many brokers from which you can automatically import trades directly
  into your Sharesight portfolio. This gives nabtrade users the opportunity to leverage
  Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features.\n\n![Sharesight import trades nabtrade](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1HvxaML9a66iqUz9oTp1Wa/77df22709152c1edb833ddcd8be73f9c/Sharesight_import_trades_nabtrade.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is nabtrade?\n\n[nabtrade](https://www.nabtrade.com.au/) is an online trading
  platform run by [NAB](https://www.nab.com.au/), one of Australia’s biggest banks.
  The platform has consistently received a 5-star value rating from Canstar, with
  brokerage fees from $14.95 per trade. Not just available to NAB customers, nabtrade
  offers all investors access to Australian and international shares, ETFs, bonds,
  margin lending and SMSF services.\n\n## Import your nabtrade data to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to import your trading history by directly connecting your nabtrade account
  to Sharesight. Alternatively, you can manually import your history by uploading
  a spreadsheet file, and automatically link ongoing trades through the Trade Confirmation
  Emails feature. Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## Connect directly to your nabtrade
  account\n\nThe easiest way to build your Sharesight portfolio is to [connect to
  your nabtrade account](https://help.sharesight.com/nabtrade/) with Sharesight. This
  imports your historical buy and sell trades directly from your trading account into
  Sharesight. \n\n![Sharesight nabtrade login](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1tXUIJSHqowKyyUFjF8QXk/4774863fe7dce19c9a889a9c53820bd8/Sharesight_nabtrade_login.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  do this, you will need to enter your nabtrade login details and choose the trading
  history you wish to import into Sharesight. \n\n***Note:** Your nabtrade login details
  will not be saved by Sharesight and your trading data is downloaded through a secure
  connection. Sharesight has no official relationship with nabtrade and offers this
  service purely for your convenience.  If you do not wish to disclose your nabtrade
  login details we recommend importing via a spreadsheet or Trade Confirmation Emails
  as outlined below.*\n\nOnce you have imported your historic trades into Sharesight,
  you can automatically import ongoing trades by using the Trade Confirmation Emails
  feature, as mentioned below. \n\n## How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet
  \n\nIf you prefer not to use your broker account login details to connect to Sharesight,
  another way to easily import historical trades to Sharesight is by uploading a spreadsheet
  with your trading history. \n\n![Sharesight nabtrade spreadsheet](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4gymT0S4TXyVizNscRvszH/8bbbc3da6e41198e49b3c9b3e8c18c6e/Sharesight_nabtrade_spreadsheet.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio. \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\nYou can also add your Sharesight portfolio email address
  to your nabtrade account, simply access your account settings, then under ‘delivery
  methods’ click ‘edit’, enter the email address and your PIN to confirm, then click
  ‘apply changes’ - this will ensure a copy of your trade confirmation emails get
  sent to Sharesight automatically.\n\n## We need your help to add more brokers!\n\nIf
  your broker is not yet on Sharesight’s [list of supported brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/),
  let us know by leaving us a message in the chat interface located at the bottom-right
  of Sharesight. What we will need is some sample buy and sell trade confirmations
  (email or PDF), the email the broker sends them from and the subject line of the
  emails.\n\nWe only require a handful of sample documents to support a new broker,
  so reach out today if you want to see yours added!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n* Help
