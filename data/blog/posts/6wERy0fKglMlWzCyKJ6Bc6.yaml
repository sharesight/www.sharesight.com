:title: How to get the most out of Sharesight’s tracking features
:url_slug: how-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-performance-tracking-features
:content: "Sharesight allows investors around the world to track their portfolio performance
  and help calculate the tax implications of investing. But with so many features,
  where do investors start? For most, their journey begins with Sharesight’s Portfolio
  Overview page, but there’s so much more.\n\nHere are the Sharesight portfolio performance
  tracking features investors need to know about:\n\n## Sharesight’s Portfolio Overview
  page\n\nOne of the first things most investors see when they log into Sharesight
  is the [Portfolio Overview Page](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/), and
  unsurprisingly this page is the most viewed as it provides an ‘at a glance’ look
  at portfolio performance.\n\n![Sharesight Portfolio Overview Page](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7LAbJWxfYE7sCZmZw6vJR0/f561bd9497e673a558965548bd912bde/Sharesight_Portfolio_Overview_Page.png?w=950)\n\n<br>When
  it comes to tracking portfolio performance, the Overview Page has a number of key
  features:\n\n### Date Filters\n\n[Date range options](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/#1)
  to filter performance using a list of common date ranges such as \"since first purchase\"
  or “in the last 6 months”.\n\n### Performance graphs\n\nA number of different [portfolio
  performance graphs](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/#3) including:\n\n**Graph
  Growth:** Dollar gains by sub-period.\n\n![Portfolio performance graph - growth](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/18Evno0DGyM2PP63CdXgHU/79540e0b00135868f56905442a89c351/Portfolio_performance_graph_-_growth.png?w=950)\n\n**Graph
  Value -- Stacked**: Portfolio value over time, stacked by report grouping eg: market,
  sector, industry or even your own [Custom Groups](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/).\n\n![Portfolio
  performance graph - stacked](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7F7UQRJxiHoZOEvR5i0W3i/fbd4fcad5a39f4174bbd092dad2730ba/Portfolio_performance_graph_-_stacked.png?w=950)\n\n**Graph
  Value -- Lines:** Portfolio value for each report grouping.\n\n![Portfolio performance
  graph - lines](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3udZpc3fvmWOrUQ0BMobA5/8ba0967f233531ec1b3f836776f04849/Portfolio_performance_graph_-_lines.png?w=950)\n\n**Graph
  Performance Index****:** Performance of opened and closed positions indexed to the
  start of the period specified in the date filter.\n\n![Portfolio performance graph

  Portfolio performance\n\nSee [portfolio performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  broken down by capital gain, dividend/distribution income, currency gain and total
  return.\n\n![portfolio performance snapshot](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3U4Fryu6vOngKkQ92xgbaG/2958d20bc89d220bfca1bbd850b02999/portfolio_performance_snapshot.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Portfolio benchmarking\n\n[Benchmark portfolio performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)
  against *any* of the 37,000 stocks, ETFs, mutual/managed funds or unit trusts that
  Sharesight tracks.\n\nFor example, the image below shows the performance of a Sharesight
  portfolio versus an ASX200 index-tracking ETF (STW.ASX), when selected this benchmark
  will also appear in the performance graphs above (where relevant).\n\n![Portfolio
  benchmarking](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5KedDmf5JhAPX2YjCFWMzB/ccb84317d20795d195832ce6740969d8/Portfolio_benchmarking.png?w=950)\n\nFor

  all of the options available to you.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Xa8phjSVhM\"

  [Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/) allows investors
  to calculate portfolio performance over **any date range**, opening up additional
  possibilities over the preset date range filters available on the Portfolio Overview
  page.\n\nAdditionally with the Performance Report it’s possible to specify whether
  to include only open, or open *and* closed (sold) positions, view performance broken
  down by Sharesight groupings (or [Custom Groups](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)),
  as well as filter the report using [labels](http://help.sharesight.com/labels/).\n\n![Sharesight
  performance report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3dRyGRNTEssZRsraBuNMMo/5beb134da23647b93406f12aba7e8319/Sharesight_performance_report.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Here
  the Performance Report shows the advanced custom date filters available as well
  as the performance of a portfolio broken down by [sector classification](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/updated-industry-classification-data/).</small>\n\n<a

  this video for a deeper dive into the Sharesight Performance Report</small>\n\n##
  Diversity Report\n\nSharesight’s [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/)
  allows investors to track portfolio diversity as at any date (in the past, or present).\n\nWhen
  running the report, it’s possible to view portfolio diversity using any of the [six
  industry classification groupings](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/updated-industry-classification-data/):
  market, sector, industry, investment type, country or no grouping at all. Additionally
  investors can classify investments using [Sharesight’s Custom Groups feature](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  based on any criteria specified.\n\n![Sharesight custom groups](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6k3z66hnD4Fa6CZDvCkUsa/28ec8f0ffc0cc11746776c9fa8c11aef/Sharesight_custom_groups.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Custom
  Groups showing an example custom allocation groupings for use in the Diversity Report.</small>\n\nBy
  specifying Custom Groups like the above, investors can assess how a portfolio is
  tracking against an [asset allocation target](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  by running the Diversity Report, then take action and rebalance the portfolio to
  meet the target.\n\n![Asset allocation](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/XLfHkoXJN2o8HtF3liZC2/7f36758a2b10539dfad909ef3367cf10/Asset_allocation.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Sharesight’s
  Diversity Report, organised by the Custom Groups shown above.</small>\n\nMake sure
  to read our guide on ‘[How to track your asset allocation strategy in Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)’
  to make the most of the Diversity Report.\n\n## Contribution Analysis Report\n\nThe
  Diversity Report gives investors an insight into how a portfolio is tracking towards
  a specific asset allocation, but with Sharesight’s [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  it’s possible to track which asset classes are contributing the most towards a portfolio’s
  performance.\n\nLike the Performance Report, the Contribution Analysis Report can
  calculate portfolio performance over *any date range*, as well as break down performance
  across any of the Sharesight groupings or Custom Groups selected.\n\n![Contribution
  Analysis Report - Market](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2r0pBZIzTiQjkCysrGrnx4/c5ca53281b4c60352e4dfb718bd4f4d0/Contribution_Analysis_Report_-_Market.png?w=950)\n\n<small>

  Export any Sharesight report\n\nAll of Sharesight’s reports can be exported to Excel,
  Google Sheets or in Adobe PDF format to perform additional calculations or as part
  of an investor’s record keeping requirements.\n\nThis is as simple as clicking on
  the icon of the desired format to export on the upper right-hand side of any report
  in Sharesight.\n\n![Export Sharesight reports](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2DXfCOlXVPWIxviYiltfVj/34e645e431069d29ab0ab865d969b79a/Export_Sharesight_reports.png?w=950)\n\n##
  How Sharesight’s CEO tracks his portfolio performance\n\nThe above tools are only
  a subset of the many features Sharesight offers investors to track their performance.
