:title: Updated Australian ETF distributions now available for FY19
:content: "We have updated ETF distribution information available for the FY19 Australian
  tax year for all [iShares (BlackRock)](https://www.blackrock.com/au/individual/ishares),
  [Russell Investments](https://russellinvestments.com/au/solutions/exchange-traded-funds/overview),
  [ETF Securities](https://www.etfsecurities.com.au/) and [Vanguard](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/productType=etf)
  ETFs from Sharesight partner [Computershare](https://www.sharesight.com/au/partners/computershare/).
  This means that for the majority of ETFs in Australia, users will not need to manually
  update their ETF distribution components from their AMMA statement using [Sharesight’s
  pro-rata form](https://help.sharesight.com/au/taxable_income/#1) to add this information
  to their portfolio.\n\nWe’re waiting on updated distribution information from Link
  Market (who cover BetaShares ETFs among others) and hope to have that distribution
  information available in Sharesight shortly after we receive it. For updates follow
  our [AMIT regime for trusts ](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/amit-regime-for-trust-distributions)[thread
  in the Sharesight community](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/amit-regime-for-trust-distributions).\n\n##
  UPDATE Sept 26th - Updated ETF data from BetaShares \n\nWe have received updated
  distribution data from BetaShares directly for the following BetaShares ETFs:\n\n-
  A200\n- AAA\n- HACK\n- HBRD\n- HVST\n- NDQ\n- QOZ\n- QPON\n- USD\n- YMAX\n\nWe've
  had to calculate some of the values from the raw data, so please double check these
  values and let us know if you find any discrepancies. \n\n## What are ETF distribution
  components?\n\n[ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)
  are a type of unitised investment fund that can be bought and sold on stock exchanges.
  These funds pay distributions to shareholders throughout the financial year for
  any income earned by the fund. In Australia, ETFs are structured as [Attribution
  Managed Investment Trusts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/),
  which impact how the income earned (dividends, realised capital gains, interest,
  etc) is split across different categories for tax reporting purposes.\n\n![AMITCostBasedecreaseexample](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/75YEkH2DuWAhyFPOa6HOtx/a97f14e7eb10742b4de4643ecf64d857/AMITCostBasedecreaseexample.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Example
  AMMA tax statement components and their corresponding fields in Sharesight</small>\n\n##
  Sharesight’s ETF distribution data\n\nSharesight receives estimates of the gross
  distribution values from the [ASX when they are announced](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/asx/),
  however [AMIT components](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  are only finalised when the fund managers know the breakdown of income earned by
  the trusts, and then they make these values available to unit holders by issuing
  year-end [AMMA tax statements](https://help.sharesight.com/au/au-amit-tax-components/).
  \n\nThis means that the distribution values Sharesight receives from the ASX do
  not contain AMIT tax component breakdowns. Sharesight has instead worked directly
  with the registries involved to collect raw data for these trusts, which we then
  use to calculate the component values for individual ETF holdings. \n\nFor ETFs
  where Sharesight has data from Computershare, users will be able to accept these
  values if they have not yet confirmed the distribution payment. Where users have
  already confirmed the payment or used the pro-rata form and want to return to the
  original values, clicking ‘reset this payout’ (per the screenshot below) when editing
  the distribution will revert the data to the updated values from Computershare.\n\n![Reset
  distribution payout Sharesight ETF](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6oEbQdL7DDeglCsW6mJOn7/527e21f1894e6a87d35efd3f02e0c6a7/Reset_distribution_payout_Sharesight_ETF.png?w=950)\n\nBecause
  each ETF fund manager uses slightly different calculations to determine unit holders’
  AMMA tax statement values, we highly recommend double-checking the values in Sharesight
  against this statement, as while we expect these to be correct in most situations,
  it’s possible a particular ETF/manager uses a different calculation to Sharesight.
  \n\nIf you do find values that don’t line up with your AMMA statement - please reach
  out via our help chat widget, or [get in touch via this forum thread](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/amit-regime-for-trust-distributions)
  so we can ensure these are correct.\n\n**NOTE: Distributions that do not yet have
  updated component values are marked with a warning icon per the screenshot below.**\n\n![Updated
