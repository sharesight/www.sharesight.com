:title: Takeaways from Livewire Live
:url_slug: livewire-live
:content: "The [Sharesight](/) team dropped in at [Livewire Live](http://bit.ly/1PdQLUi),
  hosted by Bell Direct and ASX. Livewire Live is only in its second year, but the
  panelists were top notch and the auditorium packed. If you're an Australian investor,
  have exposure to Australia, or are curious to see the world from an Australian investor's
  standpoint make sure you [watch this year's recorded videos](http://bit.ly/1PdQLUi)
  and attend next year's event (or check out the livestream).\n\n![Livewire Live 2016

  year's panel discussions focused on:\n\n1. __MACROECONOMICS__ &mdash; \"Can we get
  out of this alive?\"\n2. __STRATEGY__ &mdash; \"The art and science of beating the
  market\"\n3. __EQUITIES__ &mdash; \"Picking today's winners and avoiding the bombs\"\n4.
  __TECHNOLOGY__ &mdash; \"Making sense of the big new trends\"\n\nAnd the lineup
  was packed with well-known money managers:\n\n- Geoff Wilson (Wilson Asset Mgt)\n-
  Matthew Kidman (Centennial Asset Mgt)\n- Mark Burgess (Jamieson Coote Bonds)\n-
  Nikki Thomas (Magellan FG)\n- Vimal Gor (BT Investment Mgt)\n- Paul Moore (PM Capital)\n-
  Roger Montgomery (Montgomery AM)\n- Steve Johnson (Forager Funds)\n- Crispin Murray
  (BT Investment Mgt)\n- Ben Griffiths (Eley Griffiths)\n- Elaine Stead (Blue Sky
  VC)\n- Alex Pollack (Loftus Peak)\n- Daniel Petre (Airtree)\n- Ben Clark (TMS Capital)\n\nA
  recap on our blog won't&nbsp;do justice to the panel discussions and audience Q&A,
  so [check out the official videos](http://bit.ly/1PdQLUi) on the Livewire site:\n\n[![livewire-live

  are a few quotes that caught my attention:** \n\n> Will the Indian economy generate
  the kind of resources boom that we saw in China? I don't think so.\n\n> Too many
  Australian CEOs turn their companies into bonds.\n\n> Don't think about making money
  on trends. Think about what trends technology will destroy.\n\n> No ETF can replace
  active management in this low yield environment. You need to make investment decisions
  based on companies.\n\n> The ASX will return mid single digits at best.\n\n> We
  love the New Zealand market, including Auckland Airport and their tech sector.\n\n>
  Australian Boards have no idea because of short-term incentives, but privately they'll
  admit that finance and healthcare will be disrupted.\n\n> Self-driving cars are
  the next major disruption.\n\n> Most of the US outperformance comes from the tech
  sector. We don't have those companies in Australia.\n\n> Australia does have global
  tech players, but we're too focussed on the listed market.\n\n> Investors who ignore
  tech do so at their peril.\n\n### UPDATE\n**The Aussie fund managers above were
  asked to make a stock pick. We're tracking them in our [Livewire Live portfolio](/blog/livewire-portfolio-track-the-fund-managers-picks/)!**\n\nAnd
