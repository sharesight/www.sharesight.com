  Hi! Angela Thompson here. I’m [Sharesight](/)’s Digital Marketing Manager and the newest addition to the team. I’ve only just wrapped-up my first week at Sharesight, but can already tell that it’s going to be a great place to work. And with the official launch of our [revamped interface](/blog/the-improved-sharesight-interface-new-body-same-engine/) just around the corner, it’s a particularly exciting time to be here.

  As a cloud-based company, Sharesight appealed to me for two main reasons. First off, I’ve spent the last 10 years at BLACKIRON Data, a [Canadian](/blog/announcing-sharesight-canada/) leader in the cloud hosting space. So working for another cloud innovator - this time in the financial investment sector - seemed like a great way to expand my horizons. Secondly, my overall career has been in digital roles within relatively small companies, namely because I love their energy and “just get it done” attitude. And that’s certainly evident at Sharesight, where everyone seems to wear a few hats and has a real passion for technology and innovation.

  While my main responsibility is to grow overall awareness of our cutting-edge portfolio management application, I also want to help new customers make the most of Sharesight’s many features. So over the coming months, I’ll be reviewing our on-boarding process and filling-in the gaps with step-by-step tutorials, FAQs and videos. I want to ensure we’re doing everything we can to support new customers by showing how quick and easy it is to get data into Sharesight, [connect with Xero](/xero/), and run real-time reports for valuable investment insights.

  With continuous feature enhancements and new partnerships to announce, it’s truly a great time to be joining Sharesight. I look forward to meeting our customers and partners at future events, and contributing to Sharesight’s continued success. For all the latest news and product updates, stay tuned to this space!
