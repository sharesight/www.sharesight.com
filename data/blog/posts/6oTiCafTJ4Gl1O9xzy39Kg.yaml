:title: Diversiview by LENSELL integrates with Sharesight
:url_slug: diversiview
:content: "[Diversiview](https://diversiview.online)® by LENSELL now integrates directly
  with [Sharesight](/), making it easy for the mutual customers to analyse the health,
  deep diversification and the risk & return positions of their Sharesight portfolios
  directly in Diversiview, and take any further investment decisions with even more
  confidence.\n\nMelbourne based Fintech company LENSELL® is committed to providing
  Australian investors with access to financial and non-financial corporate performance
  insights quick, easy, and very affordable – assisting them in making informed decisions
  throughout their investment journey.\n\nA large segment of Diversiview’s early adopters
  are avid Sharesight users, so it was a straightforward decision to make their lives
  easier and connect their favourite portfolio planning tool (Diversiview) with their
  favourite reporting tool (Sharesight) using the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).
  This way, users can save time and analyse their portfolios in a few clicks. \n\n![Diversiview

  What is Diversiview?\n\nDiversiview® is an easy-to-use AI-based portfolio planning
  and optimisation tool that helps investors assess the expected performance, health
  and granular diversification of their preferred investments. Investors can plan
  and validate tailored, diversified portfolios that suit their risk tolerance profiles
  and return expectation, and that are more resilient to market volatility.\n\n![Try

  What’s unique about Diversiview?\n\nTwo words: **Deep Diversification**\n\nOnly
  3 in 10 investors' portfolios are diversified (ASX Investor Study report, 2020).
  Portfolio Deep Diversification introduced by Diversiview enables investors to mitigate
  overall portfolio risk by selecting securities that are not strongly correlated,
  that is, that behave differently during market fluctuations and allow investors
  to offset losses.\n\nResearch shows that a diversified portfolio is more resilient
  to market volatility and generally outperforms 'concentrated' portfolios in the
  longer run ([Koda Capital, 2020](https://kodacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/koda-capital_the-upside-of-maintaining-diversification_28march2020.pdf)).\n\nDeep
  Diversification is also critical in allowing investors to analyse and compare different
  portfolio risk & return positions from the huge number of possibilities and select
  the one that works for them. No other application gives such a granular view of
  the Portfolio Universe®.\n\n![Diversiview portfolio2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7FqcEvXur0sttgc0BpYcQU/d210e16f161f92b181035a848a2628c5/Diversiview_portfolio2.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Why did Diversiview integrate with Sharesight?\n\nSharesight and Diversiview solve
  two complementary problems. Diversiview helps investors plan their portfolios and
  revalidate their position and diversification as markets change, while Sharesight
  makes it easy to track portfolios’ performance and report on a variety of compliance
  aspects.\n\nSerious investors can now plan, analyse, track and report on their investment
  portfolios with an integrated view and significant time saved.\n\nThe integration
  was quick and easy using the Sharesight API.\n\n<aside class=\"pquote\">\n    <blockquote>\n

  \   </blockquote>\n</aside>\n\nDiversiview’s goal is to make it easy for every Australian
