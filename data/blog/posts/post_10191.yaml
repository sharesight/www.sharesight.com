:title: How old is too old to own shares?
:url_slug: how-old-is-too-old-to-own-shares
:content: "First I would like to add my thanks to all of our customers who responded
  to our recent customer survey. We got a fantastic response which was very encouraging
  for us because it shows you are interested in [Sharesight](/) and keen to help us
  make it even better.\n\nOne interesting fact that emerged from our survey was that
  nearly 60% of our customers are over 55 and 25% are over 65. It’s interesting because
  it shows we older folk appreciate the benefits and advantages of using online services
  but it’s not surprising. After all investing in the share market is a long term
  project and for many of us it is not until the kids have grown up and the mortgage
  is paid off that we can really start building our portfolio. \n\nOur oldest known
  customer is 93! I’d be interested to hear of anyone who can beat that. I’m not sure
  what his answer to my question above would be but it would be safe to say it would
  be more than 93!\n\nThe problem is that I have lost count of the number of times
  I have read articles from investment advisors and others advising that as we move
  through our retirement years we should reduce the proportion of our savings that
  we have invested in shares.\n\nTheir reasons for saying this have never made any
  sense to me. Are they saying that investing in the share market should be a long
  term proposition (agreed) and therefore, as life becomes less and less of a long
  term proposition, we should start selling up our shares?\n\nThere is no doubt that
  some older self-directed investors will eventually find that maintaining a share
  portfolio is too much of a chore but this does not have to mean selling up your
  portfolio. This is especially true if you are a Sharesight customer because you
  can share your portfolio with a professional advisor or family member who can then
  provide the level of assistance you require.\n\nIf you are intending to leave your
  shares to family members it makes sense for them to have the opportunity to become
  familiar with the portfolio ahead of time.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- Blog -- [SMSF
