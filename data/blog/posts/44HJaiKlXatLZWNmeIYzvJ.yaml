:title: What is loss aversion and how to protect yourself from it
:content: "###### Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and

  should not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser or
  accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nHuman beings are
  wired to feel the pain of loss much more than the joy of gain. From an evolutionary
  perspective, this makes sense for the sake of survival in the wild. But evolution
  and adaptation have taken us far away from the savannas of Africa where our brains
  were originally wired. In the modern world, our automatic response still works the
  same way as it used to work in the wild -- seeking to avoid loss at all costs.\n\nIn
  this blog, we look at what loss aversion is, explore examples of how it manifests
  itself in investing and finally how you can overcome this automatic response and
  try and shift decision making towards the rational side of your brain.\n\n![What
  is loss aversion](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4GpaFuVBcocIcWnoLGKeTL/3e5ad99eedac7815a498b7916dacd0b3/What_is_loss_aversion.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is loss aversion?\n\nThe concept of [loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)
  was developed by [Daniel Kahnemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman)
  and [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky), who were behavioural
  psychologists, and are famous for their [prospect theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory),
  which won Daniel a Nobel prize for economics. They were also among the first to
  develop an economic concept based on experimental results, rather than abstract
  theories.\n\nIn the book \"Thinking fast, thinking slow\", Daniel Kahnemann walks
  us through some examples for readers to try out.\n\nIn one example, you are offered
  a gamble on the toss of a coin. If the coin shows tails you lose $100, if it’s heads
  you win$150. Is this an attractive gamble?\n\nAlthough the expected value of the
  gamble is positive, because your probability of gain is more than your probability
  of loss, most people dislike it. The psychological loss of $100 is much more than
  the joy of winning $150.\n\nTo measure the extent of your aversion to loss, you
  can ask yourself the following question: What is the smallest gain I need to balance
  the potential loss of $100 in taking that bet? For most people, this answer is 1.5
  to 2.5x.\n\n## How does loss aversion manifest in investing?\n\nLoss aversion is
  something investors need to be mindful of, and can manifest in a number of ways,
  for example:\n\n* Investing in low-return, guaranteed investments over more promising
  investments that carry higher risk.\n\n* Holding onto the losers and selling your
  winners.\n\n* Selling a good stock \"to book a profit\" when fundamental analysis
  suggests that to realise a larger profit, you need to hold it for a longer period
  of time.\n\n* Telling yourself that an investment is not a loss until it’s realized
  (i.e., when the investment is sold). In other words, we tend to postpone the feeling
  of loss by not realizing it.\n\n## What can investors do to overcome loss aversion?\n\nInvesting
  is about making choices. It involves following a process, establishing a thesis,
  and then achieving an outcome. The process and the thesis are completely in the
  investor’s control, whereas the outcomes are controlled by external factors.\n\nInvesting
  is both a rational and emotional process. Rather than deny it, the first step is
  to accept that we are subjective beings with emotional hot buttons. Then having
  a system to help shield us from the problems our emotions can lead to as investors.\n\n##
  Ways to help avoid loss aversion\n\n### 1. Write down your investment thesis\n\nOne
  of the ways to help remove emotion from investing is to write down your investment
  thesis and regularly revisit it. While there is no one-size-fits-all methodology
  for creating your thesis, it could be based on global macro trends, financial statements,
  or your own experience of a business you seek to invest in.\n\nLooking back at [your
  portfolio regularly](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-limit-losses-with-a-stop-loss-order/)
  will help you evaluate whether this thesis still holds true and help guide whether
  you should change your holdings of that investment.\n\nSome Sharesight customersuse
  the comments box under the holding section to capture notes about their thesis.\n\n![Investment

  2. Set a stop-loss trigger \n\n[Stop-loss triggers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-limit-losses-with-a-stop-loss-order/)
  in your online broker accounts can help you shield yourself from holding investments
  in your portfolio that are falling beyond limits you set by automatically liquidating
  those holdings should they fall beyond a certain point.\n\n### 3. Take advantage
  of tax loss selling\n\nIn countries where capital gains tax applies to investments,
  it can be helpful to understand and make the best use of opportunities to engage
  in [tax harvesting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/offset-your-capital-gains-by-tax-loss-selling/)[
  or ](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/offset-your-capital-gains-by-tax-loss-selling/)[tax
  loss selling](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/offset-your-capital-gains-by-tax-loss-selling/)
  to offset your capital gains. Knowing that you can offset a loss against a gain
  can be helpful in making the decision to realize that loss by selling those investments.\n\n##
