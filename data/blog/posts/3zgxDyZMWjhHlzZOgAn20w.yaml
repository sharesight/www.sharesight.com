:title: Top 10 benchmarks used by New Zealand investors
:content: "Sharesight’s [benchmarking feature](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/)
  opens up a world of possibilities for investors to track their portfolio performance
  against more than [170,000 stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)
  from around the world. \n\nWith a wide range of global securities to choose from,
  investors can put their investment performance into context by selecting the benchmark
  that best aligns with their investment goals. For instance, choosing an ETF or fund
  that tracks a particular index, or one that tracks a known basket of stocks in an
  industry to get a commensurate comparison for their own portfolio. \n\n![image 0

  Top 10 benchmarks used by New Zealand investors in Sharesight\n\n1. [Smartshares
  NZ Top 50 ETF](#Smartshares-NZ-Top-50-ETF)\n\n2. [SPDR S&P 500](#SPDR-SP-500)\n\n3.
  [SPDR 200 Fund](#SPDR-200-Fund)\n\n4. [Smartshares NZ Mid Cap ETF](#Smartshares-NZ-Mid-Cap)\n\n5.
  [Ishares Small Ords](#Ishares-Small-Ords)\n\n6. [Smartshares NZ Top 10 ETF](#Smartshares-NZ-Top-50-ETF)\n\n7.
  [SPDR 50 Fund](#SPDR-50-Fund)\n\n8. [Vanguard All-World ex-US ETF](#Vanguard-All-World-ex-US-ETF)\n\n9.
  [NZX Limited](#NZX-Limited)\n\n10. [Vanguard S&P 500 ETF](#Vanguard-SP-500-ETF)\n\nWhen
  it comes to setting a benchmark, [many investors choose ETFs](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)
  as these typically reflect the performance of a common index, without the costs
  involved in actually owning that basket of stocks. This also gives investors a realistic
  indicator of how their money could have performed, without the effort of individually
  selecting and purchasing the stocks themselves. \n\nWe looked into the most commonly-used
  benchmarks by New Zealand Sharesight users, and unsurprisingly ETFs featured strongly,
  with the [Smartshares NZ Top 50 ETF](https://smartshares.co.nz/types-of-funds/new-zealand-shares/fnz)
  being the most popular choice. Unlike [Australian](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/top-10-portfolio-benchmarks-used-by-australian-investors/)
  and [US](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/top-10-portfolio-benchmarks-used-by-us-investors/)
  Sharesight users, New Zealand users tend to choose more global benchmarks for their
  portfolios, leveraging ETFs listed on the NYSE and ASX as well as the NZX. \n\nHere
  are the top 10 benchmarks chosen by New Zealand Sharesight users:\n\n![image 1 NZbenchmark](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7zJc3Rrooh8PXrovZgnCRq/08ed01be0978a298bcf20312dd88760f/image_1_NZbenchmark.png?w=950)\n\n###
