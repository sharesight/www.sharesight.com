:url_slug: 3-ways-sharesight-helps-investors-at-tax-time
:content: "Sharesight is the award-winning investment portfolio tracker that investors
  around the world are using to track the performance of millions of holdings. Beyond
  the platform’s powerful performance insights and dividend tracking, Sharesight is
  also a valuable tool during tax season. \n\nIf you prepare and file your own tax
  return, Sharesight provides everything you need to stay organised and save yourself
  hours of time spent number-crunching. And if you work with an accountant, Sharesight
  can potentially save you money on accounting fees by letting you share your tax
  reports with them, so they’re not starting from scratch and charging you for portfolio
  reconstruction.\n\n![tax time Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/xXA1f8IQSNhDB9nd4IIUX/adbd55fe79923834591c697245d7e877/tax_time_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\nHow
  Sharesight helps investors at tax time:\n\n- 1 -- [Global tax settings](#global-tax-settings)\n-
  2 -- [Taxable Income Report](#taxable-income-report)\n- 3 -- [Sold Securities Report](#sold-securities-report)\n-
  BONUS -- [Portfolio sharing](#bonus--portfolio-sharing)\n\n![featured - 3 ways Sharesight
  helps investors at tax time](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6mOcDlmdgFenfaz9eSg1ph/a9ec4e304aff58dc79ac5a22e06b430c/featured_3-ways-sharesight-helps-investors-at-tax-time.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  1. Global tax settings\n\nBy default, your first Sharesight’s portfolio’s tax residency
  will be set to the country you used to sign up with (users can sign up for Sharesight
  from over 100 countries), but you can create additional portfolios with other tax
  residencies if needed. You can also adjust the tax year end date to reflect that
  country’s financial year. Setting the tax residency of a portfolio determines the
  portfolio’s base currency, ensuring that any currency fluctuations on foreign investments
  are automatically incorporated into your total performance return.\n\n![add new

  Sharesight users can change the tax residency of their portfolio via the Settings
  tab. </small>\n\n## 2. Taxable Income Report\n\nWith all your dividends automatically
  tracked and in one place, Sharesight makes tax time a breeze. The [Taxable Income
  Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-sharesights-taxable-income-report/)
  takes it one step further, allowing you to see all of your dividends broken down
  over any time period, organised by local and foreign income. Other convenient features
  include the option to display individual holding totals, as well as comments; and
  the ability to export the report to an Excel spreadsheet, PDF or Google Sheets file
  – making it easy to [share the report with your accountant](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/).

  investments across global markets.  </small>\n\n## 3. Sold Securities Report\n\nIf
  you’re looking to understand how much money you made by selling shares (capital
  gains), you can get a clear breakdown of this by running the [Sold Securities ](https://help.sharesight.com/sold_shares/)[Report](https://help.sharesight.com/sold_shares/).
  The Sold Securities Report allows you to see the total return on any shares that
  have been sold within your selected date range. \n\nThe report can be personalised
  to your needs, such as the ability to group your holdings according to a range of
  default groupings including market, currency, sector, industry, investment type
  and country, or by your own [Custom Groups](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/).
  You can also toggle the $ and % symbols to see the amounts in dollars or percentages.
  The percentages are a handy way to see your relative gains/losses, while the dollar
  figures can be used to report any capital gains you might need to disclose in your
  tax return. It’s also easy to export the report to different formats, including
  an Excel spreadsheet, PDF or Google Sheets.\n\n![Sold Securities Report Sharesight

  with your accountant\n\nAnother essential tax feature is the ability to [share your
  portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/save-time-money-by-sharing-your-portfolio-with-your-accountant/).
  Rather than exporting and printing or emailing your Sharesight tax reports, you
  can securely share portfolio access directly with your accountant. With all your
  portfolio data in one place, they’ll have everything they need to prepare your tax
  documents. Available on all Sharesight plans, portfolio sharing ensures everyone’s
  on the same page and focusing on what really matters – not just at tax time but
  throughout the year.\n\n## Make tax time a breeze with Sharesight\n\nThousands of
