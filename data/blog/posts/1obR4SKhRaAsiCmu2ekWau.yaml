:title: Investors need to break these 3 bad habits once and for all
:content: "###### NOTE: A version of this article first appeared in XU Magazine.\n\nOld
  habits die hard. When it comes to share investing, investors either spend too much,
  or too little time on “portfolio admin”. Investing is hard enough. Picking the right
  investments, setting an [asset allocation strategy](/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/),
  and knowing when to buy and sell shares are all fraught with risks -- and unique
  to one’s circumstances. But, whether you’re an individual investor, accountant,
  bookkeeper or financial advisor, the administration side of investing can be even
  worse.\n\n![featured-bad-investment-habits](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2oWDLkgEus2ccIImMQKceu/c4d56c5a228fd2997e00ddd77ad169de/featured-bad-investment-habits.jpg?w=950)\n\nTrue
  performance metrics and [on-demand tax reports](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/)
  elude most investors, and lead to poor returns.\n\nPrice to price calculations are
  simple, and charting tools ubiquitous, but annualising returns to add real-life
  context and to compare to alternative options is difficult.\n\nWhat about dividends?
  Last year the ASX 200 generated almost 7% in dividend income. How do you track the
  dividend impact on your return, let alone if you’ve opted in to a [dividend reinvestment
  plan](https://help.sharesight.com/drp/)?\n\nAccounting for corporate actions is
  not something that lends itself well to manual tracking either. [Takeovers and demergers](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/)
  have a significant impact on an investment’s cost base and may force an investor
  to rethink their exposure.\n\nAll of this has an impact on a portfolio’s tax obligations.
  It’s not just a matter of knowing which shares were bought and sold, and at what
  price. Holding periods have a significant impact. [Short-term capital gains](/blog/calculate-your-capital-gains-tax-without-a-spreadsheet-or-calculator/)
  (income made by buying and selling holdings within the same year) are taxed differently
  than those bought and sold over a longer period. Dividend income from trusts is
  treated differently than listed companies to say nothing of tax breaks like [franking
  credits](/blog/dividend-franking-and-performance/).\n\nTo track and report on these
  things, investors and finance professionals have traditionally relied on a handful
  of methods. Unfortunately this had led to bad habits forming. Here are the top 3
  that need be broken once and for all. \n\n## Tracking investments with a spreadsheet\n\nMaybe
  it’s due to their DIY nature, but 70% of our customers come to [Sharesight](/) having
  previously [tracked their portfolio in a spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/).
  We can’t blame them -- until we built Sharesight, we did the same thing. But manually
  tracking all those holdings, trades, and dividends in a spreadsheet is a laborious
  and error-prone methodology. We’ve met clients who spent years perfecting the [“perfect”
  portfolio spreadsheet](/blog/ode-to-the-spreadsheet/), only to realise that their
  calculations had been off the whole time -- leading them to believe that they were
  doing much better than they actually were. An awkward (if not heartbreaking) conversation
  to say the least!\n\nEven if an investor’s spreadsheet is *technically* sound, it’s
  important to have an honest look at the actual time spent manually tracking all
  those data points. This is valuable time that could be better spent on things things
  like research, education and tax planning.\n\n## Relying on online brokers\n\nMany
  investors rely on their online broker to calculate their portfolio performance or
  capital gains. But because online broker don’t take corporate actions into account,
  their [performance numbers can mislead](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  them into thinking they’re doing better (or worse) than they actually are. One of
  our own team members realised this recently when her first share split resulted
  in her [broker misreporting her performance](/blog/why-i-use-sharesight-to-track-my-portfolio/)
  (down 48% when she was actually up nearly 5%).\n\nThis can be especially difficult
  for investors who have used [multiple online brokers](/blog/two-brokers-can-be-better-than-one/).
  How do they calculate their overall performance, across their various portfolios?
  The short answer is that they usually don’t bother, or end-up pulling everything
  into a spreadsheet -- resulting in the same issues we’ve already discussed.\n\nOnline
  brokers should be relied on to do what they do best: trade execution. Dividend,
  performance and tax reporting should be entrusted to a dedicated (and ideally, independent)
  application.\n\n## Waiting until EOFY to talk about tax\n\nIf you’re reading this
  blog, I probably don’t have to sell you on the power of the cloud. Yet the reality
  is that many investors and finance professionals still take a very “old school”
  approach to tracking share portfolios. We still hear of accountants chasing after
  mounds of investor-related paperwork at tax time, and frantically reconstructing
  share portfolios in order to sort-out their clients’ investing positions and tax
  obligations. This is especially time-consuming for larger portfolios or those dependant
  on income-generating stocks.\n\nIt helps everyone when investors can stay on top
  of their “portfolio admin” throughout the year, rather than chasing their tail at
  EOFY. For example, checking-in on [capital gains tax implications](/blog/tax-loss-selling-made-easy/)
  every now and then can not only minimise tax bill surprises, but can lead to better
  data-driven investing decisions throughout the year. And with Sharesight simplifying
  [portfolio admin for accountants and finance professionals](/pro/), they can focus
  on proactive activities, while investors get peace of mind knowing how their portfolio
  is performing year round.\n\n## Break these bad habits with Sharesight\n\nWhile
  it can be difficult to break old habits, thankfully there are new technology solutions
  that make it much easier to let go. Using a [cloud-based portfolio tracking](/)
  solution such as Sharesight is a great start. It automatically tracks share prices,
  buy/sell dates, dividends, brokerage fees and currency fluctuations -- and then
  leverages this information to produce powerful [performance and tax reports](https://help.sharesight.com/reports/).
  This provides unmatched tracking and insight into investment portfolios. With everything
  in one place, there’s no need for tedious portfolio reconstruction at tax time.
  And it provides accountants everything they need to prepare and file tax returns.
  Tasks that normally took hours or even days can now be done in minutes, in just
  a few clicks. So rather than spending copious amounts of time looking back over
  the year’s activities and preparing tax returns, investors can have forward-looking
  tax discussions with their accountant instead.\n\n[![sharesight-xero-sync](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3imhsEBtMAAo6cuWSuscIU/07d8daabc2fc0d0bd081afabb0a37f4f/sharesight-xero-banner-110fa3c8.png?w=950)](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/)\n\nTaking
  it a step further, when investors [sync their investment portfolios to Xero](https://help.sharesight.com/xero_settings/),
  details of share purchases, sales, and dividends flow into Xero automatically so
  they can be easily reconciled against bank statements and incorporated into personal
  wealth and budgeting pictures. With portfolio data flowing into Xero in real-time,
  both investor and accountant are on the same page -- so there’s no paper-chasing
  and repetitive data entry work required. It’s a seamless investment portfolio management
  and accounting solution made possible by a growing [fintech ecosystem](/blog/where-sharesight-fits-in-fintech-australias-ecosystem-map/)
  of connected applications.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, understanding a [portfolio’s
  true returns ](/blog/where-sharesight-fits-in-fintech-australias-ecosystem-map/)and
  the resulting tax implications is key to making informed investing decisions. When
  investors and their trusted finance professionals have access to this information
  at any time, and from anywhere, they’re able to focus on the big picture instead
  of always trying to fill the gaps.\n\n[Sign up for Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
