:content: "As part of our commitment to empowering global investors, we are pleased
  to announce the launch of 15 minute delayed pricing for US markets such as the **Nasdaq**
  and **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)**, as well as the **London Stock Exchange (LSE)**.
  With almost 30% of Sharesight users investing in these markets, Sharesight is making
  sure investors have access to the latest stock price and performance data they need
  to become better investors. To find out more about our expanded support for intraday
  pricing, keep reading. \n\n![Sharesight launches intraday pricing for US and UK

  Stock exchanges with intraday price data in Sharesight\n\nSharesight has launched
  15 minute delayed pricing for the following North American and UK markets: \n\n*
  [Nasdaq](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-on-the-nasdaq-with-sharesight/)\n\n*
  [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-the-new-york-stock-exchange-nyse-with-sharesight/)
  (NYSE)\n\n* NYSE American (AMEX)\n\n* BATS Exchange (BATS)\n\n* [London Stock Exchange](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-on-the-london-stock-exchange-lse-with-sharesight/)
  (LSE).\n\nThis is in addition to Sharesight’s existing 20 minute delayed pricing
  for the [Australian Stock Exchange](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/introducing-20-minute-delayed-pricing-for-asx-holdings/)
  (ASX) and [New Zealand Stock Exchange](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/introducing-20-minute-delayed-pricing-for-nzx-holdings/)
  (NZX), making it easy for anyone who invests across multiple markets to ensure they
  always have the most up-to-date price data for all the stocks in their portfolio.
  \n\n## Track all your investments in one place\n\nWith support for over [40 leading
  global markets](https://www.sharesight.com/faq/#which-stock-exchanges-does-sharesight-support)
  and the ability to track the price and performance of investments across different
  asset classes, currencies and brokers, Sharesight is the ultimate portfolio tracker
  for anyone who owns investments across multiple markets or asset classes.\n\nUnlike
  the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight takes into account the impact of capital
  gains, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/), brokerage fees
  and currency fluctuations when calculating returns – giving investors the full picture
  of their portfolio’s performance. Sharesight also offers a range of powerful reports
  for self-directed investors including [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/),
  and [Multi-Currency Valuation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/).
  The ability to track [cash accounts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/),
  [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/)
  and even [cryptocurrency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/)
  is just another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track
  their investment portfolio.\n\n### Multi-Currency Valuation \n\nWith Sharesight’s
  [Multi-Currency Valuation Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/),
  investors can clearly see the value of their investments denominated in the currency
  of their choice. This is useful for global investors and expats who \"think\" in
  another currency outside of the currency of their tax residency. The screenshot
  below for example, shows the Multi-Currency Valuation Report being used to convert
  investments from AUD to GBP in a global investment portfolio with an Australian
  tax residency. \n\n![intraday pricing Multi Currency Valuation Report edit2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3kkg6JbV9aPRRUVcM1Zb8L/24b5845e498ecfcdb972438ccc3c232e/intraday_pricing_Multi_Currency_Valuation_Report_edit2.jpg?w=950)\n<small>
  The Multi-Currency Valuation Report, sorted by market, for a portfolio with AMEX,
  ASX, LSE, NASDAQ and NYSE investments. </small>\n\n## How to track your US and UK
