:title: How to calculate a stock's dividend growth rate
:content: "If you’re a dividend investor, you may have seen the term \"dividend growth
  rate\" mentioned as a measure of a promising dividend stock. The dividend growth
  rate is the annualised percentage rate of growth that a stock’s dividend will experience
  over time. Used in tandem with other metrics, the dividend growth rate can be an
  effective way to evaluate a dividend stock. To learn more about how the dividend
  growth rate is calculated, how it can be used and how Sharesight helps investors
  [keep track of their dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/), keep
  reading.\n\n![How to calculate a stock's dividend growth rate (1)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2SaP5f9khNnxENeH1Gnthq/3f1583ea482418baeca0b28f5a9bf92e/How_to_calculate_a_stock-s_dividend_growth_rate___1_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How do you calculate the dividend growth rate?\n\nThe dividend growth rate of a
  stock can be calculated using any period of time; typically annually but it can
  also be half-yearly or quarterly. To calculate the [annual dividend growth rate](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/dividend-growth-rate/),
  for example, you will need to compare the dividend payment from one year to the
  next, using the following formula:  \n*(year 2 value / year 1 value) - 1*. \n\nOnce
  you have found the dividend growth rate for several consecutive years, you can take
  the arithmetic average of these figures to come up with a forward-looking growth
  rate. For example, \n*( 4% + 5.5% + 3% + 7% ) / 4 = 4.875 or 4.875%*. It can also
  be useful to compare the dividend growth rate for different companies across the
  same sector or industry to determine whether a particular stock is a good investment
  based on its forward-looking growth rate. \n\n## What is a good dividend growth
  rate?\n\nWhen dividend growth rates are consistent and trending up, they suggest
  a good investment to potential shareholders, as well as being indicative of a bright
  future for the company itself. Looking at dividend growth rates alone, however,
  can be a trap when looking to invest. \n\nIf a company’s dividend growth rate fluctuates
  wildly; from 4% one year to 20% the next and 2% the year after that, their average
  growth rate for that period would be 8.6%, a figure which isn’t indicative of stability
  or consistent increases in dividends. This isn’t the best metric to use alone when
  deciding to invest. Instead, it is ideal to look at both the dividend yield *and*
  the dividend growth rate. If the growth rate and yield are both consistent and steady,
  this means the shareholder’s return on their investment will be greater, as shareholders
  will be receiving a reasonable yield, consistently. A higher yield means the shareholder
  will receive more money in their dividend, while a steady and high growth rate means
  this will increase consistently over time. \n\n## How much do dividends increase
  over time?\n\nThere is no single answer as to how much dividends increase over time
  because it is dependent on the individual company in which shareholders have invested,
  and the ebbs and flows of that company’s successes. Dividend growth rates also vary
  by business cycles and only rarely increase indefinitely over time. \n\nTypically,
  companies will try to increase the rate of dividends they pay to their shareholders
  year on year in order to return value to investors who own the stock. This has a
  secondary effect of increasing the company’s stock price due to \"dividend discount
  models\" (DDM), which predict the future share price of companies based on the theory
  that the company’s current price is worth the sum of its future dividends, discounted
  back to their present value. This theory is meant to demonstrate whether a stock
  is fairly valued, despite the prevailing market conditions. If the value calculated
  by the DDM is greater than current trading prices, this indicates that the company’s
  shares are undervalued and drives investors to buy.\n\n## What is a dividend growth
  model?\n\nA dividend growth model is another term for a dividend discount model.
  One of the most well-known dividend growth models is the Gordon Growth Model, which
  is based on the assumption that a company’s dividends will experience constant growth.
  Looking at historical data and the required rate of return, it allows shareholders
  to decide whether they are snapping up undervalued shares or if they are overpaying.\n\nThe
  [Gordon Growth Model formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendgrowthrate.asp)
  is *P = D1 / ( r - g )* where:\n\n**P =** current stock price\n\n**D =** next year’s
  dividend value\n\n**g =** expected constant dividend growth rate, in perpetuity\n\n**r
  =** required rate of return\n\nWhen the formula delivers a share price higher than
  the current price of the share, then the stock being assessed is considered undervalued
  and is potentially a good investment.\n\nThis model can be [limiting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp)
  however, as it is not realistic to assume a stock’s dividend per share will consistently
  increase. The relationship between the discount factor and the growth rate can also
  be problematic; if **g** is worth more than **r**, the result is a negative value,
  which makes the model useless. The same is true if the values of **g** and **r**
  are equal – it would suggest the value per share is approaching infinity. Therefore,
  the Gordon Growth Model is another example of a metric that should not be used alone
  to make investment decisions. \n\n## Keep track of your dividends with Sharesight\n\nKeeping
