:title: Calculate your investment portfolio diversification with Sharesight
:url_slug: calculate-investment-portfolio-diversification-sharesight
:content: "A common strategy for investors looking to safeguard their assets against
  risk, investment portfolio diversification is especially important for long-term
  investors or those investing for retirement, who have a higher likelihood of being
  exposed to market corrections or other economic events. While many investors think
  their portfolio is diversified, they often overestimate their diversity due to a
  lack of clarity around what their asset allocation is and how to calculate investment
  portfolio diversity. Using an asset allocation calculator like Sharesight’s [Diversity
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/) is one easy way for investors
  to determine their asset allocation, giving them the information they need to make
  informed decisions and rebalance their portfolio as needed. \n\n![Calculate your
  investment diversity](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6mV6PmS4wbaqWjxyBPsuov/51e2eef3e7dfb780ac49c9ed8c1e2411/Calculate_your_investment_diversity.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Why does investment portfolio diversification matter?\n\n[Investment diversification](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-diversification-in-investing/)
  seeks to lower correlation risk across a basket of assets in an investment portfolio
  to mitigate the risk of a single event impacting the portfolio’s returns. In other
  words, investing across different sectors, asset classes and markets can be a good
  way to minimise correlation between assets and reduce losses in the event of a market
  correction impacting a particular sector or asset class. \n\n## How to calculate
  investment diversification\n\nThere are many different ways to group a portfolio’s
  investments in order to calculate the portfolio’s asset allocation or level of diversification.
  For example, investors may choose to determine their portfolio’s diversity by **market**,
  **currency**, **sector**, **industry**, **investment type**, **country**, or a **[custom
  grouping based on investment attributes of their choice](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)**.
  \n\n## Calculate your portfolio’s investment diversity with Sharesight\n\nIt’s easy
  to calculate your investment diversity with Sharesight’s [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/),
  which provides investors with a breakdown of their portfolio’s asset allocation
  based on the classifications of their choice. To learn more about how the report
  gives investors an accurate view of their portfolio’s diversity, keep reading. \n\n###
  Calculate the asset allocation of your portfolio\n\nThe report gives investors a
  breakdown of their asset allocation in each category, expressed in both percentage
  and cash values – making it easy to see exactly how much a portfolio’s holdings
  are weighted towards each asset class. This makes it easy for investors to track
  their asset allocation throughout the year and rebalance their portfolio according
  to their asset allocation target. \n\nThe screenshot below, for example, shows the
  [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/) being used to
  determine a portfolio’s asset allocation by investment type, where it comprises
  49.68% ordinary shares, 26.69% currency, 12.85% depository receipts, 8.51% ETFs
  and 2.27% cash accounts. If the investor in question was targeting greater diversity
  in their asset classes, they may decide that they are overweight in ordinary shares
  and underweight in cash, or they might consider investing in an additional asset
  class such as [property](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight/),
  for instance. \n\n![DiversityReport overview](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7jM50Lwle3DxIdNr9T63dC/2cc714c8481a1abc152c77192012fbbd/DiversityReport_overview.PNG)\n\n<small>
  The Diversity Report used for a portfolio of global investments, classified by investment
  type. </small>\n\n### Track portfolio diversification using the dimensions of your
  choice\n\nSharesight’s [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  feature can be used with the [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/)
  to define asset allocation by the dimensions of your choice. This is useful for
  investors who need an easy way to calculate portfolio diversification based on their
  unique risk profile and collection of assets. The screenshot below, for example,
  shows the feature being used to differentiate between different types of stocks
  and ETFs, while also highlighting REITs and cryptocurrency investments.\n\n![DiversityReport
  custom groups](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/D0XtmMbDOrb3NRfUIOiq0/807106010f25bea09e6c238d83a49111/DiversityReport_custom_groups.PNG)\n\n<small>

  ETFs, trusts and cryptocurrency. </small>\n\n**Note:** For Sharesight users with
  multiple portfolios, it is also possible to view your asset allocation across all
  of your investments by creating a [Consolidated View](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/).\n\n###
  Compare your asset allocation over different periods\n\nThe [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/)
  allows investors to view their asset allocation on any date of their choice. This
  is useful for investors who want to compare their asset allocation from one period
  to the next, or use the information to prepare financial statements such as asset
  allocation and investing strategy reports for their [SMSF](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/the-importance-of-asset-allocation-tracking-for-smsfs/)
  or any other self-managed pension fund.\n\n### Track against your asset allocation
  strategy with your financial advisor\n\nAnother convenient feature of the [Diversity
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/) is the ability to export
  this data to share it with your financial advisor, giving them the information they
  need to track your investments against your asset allocation strategy. To make this
  easier, Sharesight allows you to [export the report to different file formats](https://help.sharesight.com/exporting-a-report/)
  such as Google Sheets, an XLS spreadsheet or PDF file.\n\n## Calculate more than
