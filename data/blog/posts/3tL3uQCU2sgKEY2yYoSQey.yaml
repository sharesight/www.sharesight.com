:title: How to interpret the P/E ratio
:url_slug: how-to-interpret-the-pe-ratio
:content: "The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio is one of the many investment metrics
  Sharesight displays on stocks to help investors make better investing decisions.
  Investors and analysts alike often use this metric to determine whether a stock’s
  price is of fair value. To learn more about the different types of P/E ratios and
  how to interpret them as an investor, keep reading. \n\n![How to interpret the PE
  ratio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/8JNqGW5trJCKu1gQ3eOpt/8898c83c8a3eae0fc38a04ef546e7c84/How_to_interpret_the_PE_ratio.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is the P/E ratio? \n\nThe P/E ratio is a widely used measure of stock valuation
  and is generally based on the most recent price divided by the earnings per share
  (EPS) of a company. Investors can use the P/E ratio to assess a stock’s relative
  value against the current market price, which allows them to find opportunities
  to trade when these values diverge significantly.\n\n## How to interpret different
  types of P/E ratios\n\nThe P/E ratio can hide a number of subtleties, which are
  important to understand if you are going to make use of this ratio.\n\n### 1. Unadjusted
  historical P/E\n\nThis is the P/E ratio figure the ASX produces and is displayed
  in Sharesight for stocks listed on this particular exchange. It is the most basic
  version and takes the reported EPS of the last two 6-month reporting periods and
  is divided into the current price. It is generally sufficient, but the limitation
  is that it is backward looking and doesn’t adjust for one-off \"abnormal earnings\"
  which might skew the results up or down for one particular year.\n\n### 2. Forward
  P/E\n\nThis is what most research analysts will show in their reports. This takes
  the forecast current year earnings (as predicted by the analyst) and is divided
  into the current price. This has the benefit of being forward looking, which is
  more important to the stock price. It will also usually adjust for abnormals. However,
  it has the downside that it is based on a prediction which can be (and frequently
  is) wrong. It’s not easy to predict the future!\n\n### 3. Time-weighted adjusted
  P/E\n\nThis is a variation of the two which Morningstar still uses and which I quite
  like (I was a co-developer of it). It takes the average of consensus forecasts and
  the last actual and weighs it by the time elapsed from the last actual to the next
  year end. It also adjusts for abnormals. It tends to produce more balanced P/Es
  which are easier to compare with each other and less subject to short-term swings.\n\n**In
  short – understand what you’re looking at when interpreting P/E ratio data.**\n\n##
