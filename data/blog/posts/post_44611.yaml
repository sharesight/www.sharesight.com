:content: |-
  We're excited to announce that we are presenting at the upcoming **Afiniation Showcase** in Sydney on Thursday 24th September. If you're interested in fintech, this is your opportunity to watch 30 of the best and most innovative new financial and banking companies across Australasia demo their products in a rapid-pace format.

  ![Afiniation Ivy - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2OnZ74rmIMSsEO8A8qkIg6/aaf04ed65901294b4f99ec8404b09fb1/featured_afiniation_ivy.jpg?w=950)

  ### Format
  Each presenter is given 7 minutes to provide an overview and demonstration of their innovative technology. (We love that slides are not permitted for this event, as it weeds-out the fluff from the real players, and of course eliminates the dreaded "death by Powerpoint" syndrome all too common at tech conferences!)

  ### Attendees
  The event audience will consist of a high-impact audience of senior financial and banking executives, investors, press, industry analysts, entrepreneurs and regulators.

  ### Venue
  The Afiniation Showcase will be held at the beautiful and spacious Ivy Ballroom, with networking drinks to follow at The Den, the exclusive bar within the complex.

  ### Discount Code
  As a friend of Sharesight, we would like to offer you a 10% discount when you buy tickets. Simply use the code **MatesRates2015** when booking to get your discount.
