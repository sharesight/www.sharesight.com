:title: Why do accountants love Sharesight?
:url_slug: why-do-accountants-love-sharesight
:content: "###### This article has been updated: [6 reasons why accountants love Sharesight
  Pro](/blog/6-reasons-why-accountants-love-sharesight-pro/)\n\n### (hint: it's not
  because they're pretending to be portfolio managers)\n\nOur Partner Edition, [Sharesight
  Pro](/pro/) has been live for just over a year. We built it because we had accounting
  firms using our original, DIY product and asking for more features. Most of what's
  available is a direct result of their input. Adoption has been terrific amongst
  all sorts of accountants and more recently, wealth managers. And since we were named
  [Xero's Add-On Partner of the Year](/blog/sharesight-wins-xero-add-partner-year/),
  collecting feedback from our clients and building what they ask for is a strategy
  we'll stick with.\n\n![Heart Calculator - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/c6w1tuaABGYS2wU0KwA4y/1d8b41305c20b0d8be09419807dcab82/featured_heart-calculator)\n\nThe
  Sharesight Pro client base runs the gamut from two-partner practices on the South
  Island to the international \"Big 4\" (proud to say all four as a matter of fact).
  These early adopters are businesses who've moved into the cloud, whose clients have
  referred them to Sharesight, or accountants who happen to be investors themselves.
  \n\nSince the commitment it takes to become a Sharesight Partner is minimal ($60
  per month), we have the benefit of watching firms as they join our ecosystem and
  grow. The main reason partners say they're satisfied? Time saved. But we've noticed
  a few more trends and common questions as we've grown:\n\n## Sharesight is not a
  database (except when you want it to be)\nAccounting firms are conditioned to think
  of investment data in terms of one, hulking, monolithic database versus a \"live\"
  portfolio. This is due to how financial data has been sold historically. Super expensive
  enterprise software, which must be downloaded and manually updated, was the only
  way to access historical share prices, dividends, and corporate actions. Practices
  had to buy the database and then work out how many access licenses were required.&nbsp;When
  doing portfolio accounting work under this regime, staff members must work out point-to-point
  performance calculations by querying this database and then working out the capital
  gains and distribution implications — on a holding-by-holding basis. The only time
  the data is current is on the day the work is done: the portfolio moves on, the
  database does not.\n\nHaving broad access to this mass of data is great if you're
  working on a PhD in quantitative analysis. Otherwise, 99% of the data purchased
  goes to waste. This is a great business model if you sell the content, but terribly
  expensive if you're doing once-per-year tax prep.\n\n![Powerful Data](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6L7ckHJnqg0gQq8GWcGqWI/5c304dcccada6ab6806d81b27ec4466b/overview.png?w=950)\n\nIn
  reality a portfolio is an ever-changing entity, which updates at the close of trading
  every day. We believe that tracking a client's transactions **as they occur** is
  the most effective approach. We've already bought the hulking, monolithic database
  on your behalf. We track when your clients make trades or receive dividends, and
  \"ping\" the database to create an ongoing timeline of investment history. This
  achieves two things at once: an automated record-keeping solution, and up-to-date
  performance and tax positioning.\n\nWith all that in mind, our partners are still
  able to leverage the historical data we've licensed. Each partner account has access
  to a Demo portfolio, which can be used to go back in time. Need 20 years of dividends
  for CBA? Just enter a trade and export the Taxable Income report. We've also built
  the [Share Checker](/blog/how-can-i-quickly-check-share-performance-and-dividends/),
  which lets you run hypothetical trades across our database, over any time period.\n\n##
  So what does my client need to do?\nNothing, something, or everything. The degree
  to which an accountant involves clients is up to each firm. The beauty of the cloud
  ecosystem is that it relies on client engagement to really hum. We land on the side
  of an informed client being a happy client.\n\n![Share Access](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2f6TIBGvpGCKkEIoQKOGQ8/c036f8908aecc2a0f7cd4ea780ae19b8/sharing1.png?w=950)\n\nIf
  you have clients who are hands-on investors, our encouragement is to give them Read
  & Write access so they can import their portfolios from their broker. This allows
  them to dictate how much trading history is added to Sharesight. They manage the
  portfolio from an investing standpoint, and the accountant manages the portfolio
  from a tax minimisation standpoint. On the other hand, if your client only holds
  a few shares and relies on your expertise, you may decide to just generate tax-time
  reports without sharing access at all.\n\nIf you do [share access to a portfolio
  with your client](https://help.sharesight.com/share_with_client/), they can see
  everything that you can (but can't necessarily edit data). For some accountants
  and financial advisers, this takes some getting used to. Apart from portfolio setup,
  there's very little on-going admin work to be done. While this may jeopardise a
  one-off fee for administrative services, we'd argue that it strengthens the relationship
  long-term. A strategic tax planning discussion is a lot more valuable than a tax
  retrospective.\n\n## Cost\nRegardless of the use case, an entity costs $144 per
  annum via our Partner Edition, and becomes less expensive once [volume thresholds](/pro/)
  are reached. That $144 gives you unlimited reign across our 20 years of historical
  data, unlimited holdings, unlimited portfolio value, and unlimited sharing with
  clients and staff. And we offer training and setup too. We don't get bogged down
  in pricing discussions as most people quickly work out how to absorb that cost —
  time saved setting up historical data being reason enough to join.\n\n![Sharesight
  Value](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3zzWmrlcdOsq4kcws4qKcK/4338a641eb9d652a61edd265d1109766/pro_pricing.png?w=950)\n\nEvery
  once in a while we have a tyre-kicker challenge us on cost. Normally it's because
  they haven't tried to do anything meaningful with the product. Often these trial
  runs consist of someone adding 1 holding, bought last week. This means you can't
  run any meaningful reports. And when you don't leverage the historical data available,
  or the fact that Sharesight listens for trades in the future, that doesn't make
  for a very exciting experience! And that's the beauty of Sharesight, once setup,
  it takes care of the rest for you.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Blog: [6 of the top
