:title: Stop using investment watchlists to track your portfolio
:content: "Online habits in the age of dial-up internet now look like an innocent
  foray into the world of cyberspace. Silly screennames, hundreds of bookmarks, and
  web browser home pages set to Yahoo!, AOL, or Telstra BigPond were all hallmarks
  of the time. \n\nFortunately, we’ve become much savvier digital consumers in the
  years since. Broadband certainly helped, and the iPhone was a game changer. I peg
  2005 as a turning point -- that is when I noticed the hardware and software I used
  at home beginning to outstrip the expensive corporate stuff I used for work.\n\n##
  It’s not the 1990s, its time to bury your investment watchlist\n\nA stubborn relic
  of the dial-up era that refuses to die, however, is the investment watchlist. \n\nSay
  what you will about Yahoo!, but Yahoo! Finance, launched in the mid 1990s continues
  to be a great resource for investors. [Google Finance](/blog/4-ways-sharesight-is-better-than-google-finance/),
  too, has done an admirable job of copying Yahoo!, while the iPhone’s default Stocks
  app can also be quite handy.\n\nUnfortunately, these websites and apps and ([online
  brokers](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)) have conditioned
  millions of investors to interpret their investment returns incorrectly. Here is
  a basic illustration using just one stock: Apple (AAPL).\n\nYahoo!’s *My Portfolio*
  sports a slick interface. They offer a handy way to customise the look and feel
  as well as a range of data points, including analyst estimates. Unfortunately, their
  performance calculations are super basic.\n\n![yahoo finance portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3N80PIMhEke68GGiwEGi4s/1ab9425f0846de48eb29ab65ff3d9629/yahoo_finance_portfolio.png?w=950)\n\nYahoo!
  lets me enter multiple transactions, but does not factor in brokerage fees. Additionally,
  they do not let me enter my trading history in bulk or connect to a broker for any
  automation.\n\n### Total vs annualised return\n\nMore importantly, Yahoo! only calculates
  total return. My investment returned 102.37%, but over what period? Sharesight’s
  [annualised calculation methodology](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/)
  is far more useful because it allows you to make real-world comparisons. \n\n###
  Dividends? What dividends?\n\nThere’s another very important thing missing from
  Yahoo!’s product. There is no dividend information whatsoever. Apple started paying
  a dividend in 2012. [Dividends have a major impact on portfolio performance](/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/).
  Not knowing your portfolio’s dividend yield is only knowing half your return story.\n\nAccording
  to [Sharesight](/), Apple has returned 31.15% per year, which includes 2.63% in
  dividend income. \n\n![Sharesight Apple AAPL](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4exnkpnx7GKCug6KeaKOu2/fd764ff79be206578e8af183a69295eb/Sharesight_Apple_AAPL.png?w=950)\n\n###
  What about corporate actions?\n\nThere is one final, and very important distinction
  between a watchlist like Yahoo! Finance and portfolio software like Sharesight.
  Yahoo!, Google, etc. do not factor in [corporate actions](/blog/corporate-actions-and-your-investment-performance/)
  because they are just too difficult to deal with. Sharesight does the hard stuff
  too.\n\nIn June 2014 Apple gave every shareholder an extra [seven shares for every
  one share](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/10/apples-stock-split-history.aspx)
  held, thereby reducing the listed share price dramatically. Relying on Yahoo! or
  Google Finance is misleading because they have overwritten this on their price charts,
  probably for cosmetic reasons.\n\nIn my Yahoo! portfolio above you can see that
  I bought 100 shares for $77.28 (I relied on the info available from Yahoo!). However,
  the share price on the purchase date of 3 January 2014 was not $77.38. It was $540.98.\n\nThe
  reality is buying 100 shares of Apple in January 2014 would not have cost you $7,728
  as per Yahoo! It would have cost you over $54,000! As you can see in the Sharesight
  example, the value of my Apple holding is over $100k compared to $15k in Yahoo!\n\nMessy
  as they can be, you need to keep track of corporate actions for accurate performance
  and tax reasons. In the case of Apple’s [share split](https://help.sharesight.com/share-splits/),
  Sharesight knows when these complex [corporate actions](https://help.sharesight.com/corporate-actions/)
  occur and even records them in the investor’s transaction log automatically.\n\n##
  There is too much at stake\n\nWhen it comes to understanding the true performance
  of your investments, tracking dividends and corporate actions you need a full featured
  share portfolio platform like Sharesight. \n\nSure, using watchlists like Yahoo!
  to keep an eye on certain investments and the news around them is something I do.
  But I would never trust investment watchlists to be my official record-keeper or
  to do performance reporting. There is just too much at stake. \n\nIt is time to
  ditch your watchlist and [sign up for Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup).\n\n###
