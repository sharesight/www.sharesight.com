  were led by Contact Energy (NZX: CEN), which has recently faced delays on its landmark
  Tauhara geothermal project, but has seen growth in its share price as investors
  speculate that the company will soon enter the [MSCI New Zealand Index](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8102f683-df8d-4751-aa62-006f3d10bf8a).\n\nLet’s
