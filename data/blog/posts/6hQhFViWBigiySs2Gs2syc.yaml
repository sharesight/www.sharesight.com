:title: Open Banking changes in Australia
:content: "An area that we’re particularly passionate about at [Sharesight](/) is
  your access and control over personal financial data, which is why we’ve been [involved
  as a member](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-founding-member-of-fintech-australia/)
  of Fintech Australia’s Open Data Working Group in the Australian Government’s Open
  Banking Review.\n\nWe welcome the recent [Australian Government decision](http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media-release/049-2018/)
  to create a regulated system that will allow Australians to unlock their own financial
  data, and provide more choice over financial products and services while enabling
  a more competitive marketplace.\n\nThe Australian government [has accepted the timeframe](http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media-release/049-2018/)
  proposed by the Farrell report into Open Banking, which will see the first phase
  of the open banking reforms introduced within the next 12 months. \nThe three phases
  will progressively unlock consumer access to data, with:\n\n1. Bank transaction
  and deposit accounts, plus debit and credit card data, available by July 2019 \n2.
  Mortgage data available by February 2020\n3. Remaining financial products recommended
  by the review made available by July 2020\n\nOur hope is that this last phase will
  make it easier for Australian investors to [import their brokerage and investment
  accounts into Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/importing-your-trading-history-directly-from-your-broker/)
  where their broker does not already support the [Sharesight API](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/power-your-business-with-the-sharesight-api/).\n\nSharesight
  CEO Doug Morris sees this as an exciting move: “Obviously Sharesight is concerned
  with things like brokerage and investment accounts, but starting with the big retail
  product like transaction accounts is the best, first move for all parties and ought
  to get the ball rolling on the others, which is what we have seen in the UK.”\n\nStill
  confused about Open Banking? Let us break down what it means.\n\n## What is Open
  Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is a concept that refers to banks and financial institutions
  making data available back to consumers via secure, widely accepted technologies.\n\nOpen
  Banking promises increased access and control over personal financial data, and
  delivers increased choice and more competitive financial products and services.
  A basic example is a lender who could offer more competitive loans based on your
  banking history, versus a one-size-fits-all bank approach. You, the consumer, would
  authenticate the connection between the bank and your lender, who could then offer
  you a more competitive rate.\n\n![Open Banking in Australia](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5msXxaQh8sK6SAMUW08qok/0e75b5f47e0309ff8413b828a274c831/featured_open-banking.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Why Open Banking matters\n\nWe’re passionate about Open Banking because we devote
  significant development resources to making it as easy as possible for investors
  to get their data into Sharesight -- which is made next to impossible by financial
  institutions who have done their best to lock up that data.\n\nWith Open Banking
  changes coming into effect, we’re excited for investors (and fintechs) over the
  coming years, with the promise of new data aggregation tools, [portfolio analysis](https://help.sharesight.com/benchmarking/),
  investment ideas, tax efficiencies, and cost savings to come.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
