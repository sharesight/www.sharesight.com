:title: 3 ways Sharesight Pro simplifies NZ tax returns
:content: "With the [2016/17 IRD deadline](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/calendars-dates/importantdates-index.html)
  at the end of March for individuals who file through a registered agent, you’re
  likely scrambling to get your clients’ portfolio admin in order. And once last year’s
  taxes are filed, it will be time to start planning ahead for next year’s 2017/18
  IRD deadline.\n\nHere are 3 ways you can get a head-start on preparing your clients’
  tax returns with [Sharesight Pro](/pro/), before they even make an appointment to
  see you!\n\n## 1. Share access with your client\n\nIf you haven’t already done so,
  a great precursor to sitting down with your client to file their return is to [give
  them access to their Sharesight portfolio](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/share_with_client/).
  You can provision ‘guest’ access with either ‘read’, ‘read + write’, or full admin
  capabilities.\n\n![Screen Shot 2018-03-20 at 12.02.16 PM](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4XfHxcsswg42uqsOOyssso/27cd2059439e38636fbdc9ca34a78ccd/Screen_Shot_2018-03-20_at_12.02.16_PM.png?w=950)\n\nBy
  providing your client with access to their own portfolio, they become more engaged
  with their investments and can look over the details to ensure nothing is missing.
  For example, your client may occasionally trade with a second (or third) broker,
  and these trades may not automatically be imported to Sharesight. Having your client
  double-check their trades and dividends, even as a one-off before the end of the
  financial year, could save you both the time and effort of having to follow-up on
  figures that don’t match up at the last minute!\n\n## 2. Leverage professional-grade
  tax reports\n\nSharesight produces professional reports used by hundreds of [accounting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/why-do-accountants-love-sharesight/)
  firms, financial planners, and advisors suitable to meet the ongoing performance
  and tax reporting requirements of their clients.\n\nThe two most accessed reports,
  come NZ tax time, are the [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/taxable_income/)
  and the [Foreign Income Fund Report](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/),
  with the latter allowing calculation using either the [Fair Dividend Rate Method](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/fdr_income_fif_reports_page/)
  or [Comparative Value Method](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/cv_method_fif_reports_page/)
  to suit your client’s needs. \n\n![featured laptop-fif-report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2aHqKm5P4sIicwmCecCqQ0/c89c15f8e7e08291203f807b04d5dda1/featured_laptop-fif-report.jpg?w=950)\n\nAnother
  report designed with Sharesight Pro Partners in New Zealand in mind is the [Traders
  Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/traders_tax/) which calculates taxable
  gains for clients who hold shares on revenue account. The Traders Tax Report allows
  clients to carry-over losses from the previous period and optimise the sale allocation
  method.\n\nFor a ‘portfolio snapshot’ or ‘valuation’, you can refer to the [Performance
  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/) – or to view the portfolio
  at ‘cost’, refer to our [Historical Cost Report](https://help.sharesight.com/historical_cost_report/).
  You can choose from a number of default date ranges, such as ‘last financial year’,
  or nominate your own required start and end dates.\nSharesight allows you to export
  all data from these reports into either Excel, PDF or [Google Drive](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/new-open-sharesight-reports-directly-google-sheets/).
  \n\nIf you’re not using Sharesight’s [award-winning Xero integration](https://www.sharesight.com/xero/),
  you can export the data to import into your preferred accounting program. And you
  can even provide your client with a PDF report that is [personalised with your company
  branding](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/applying-your-logo-to-reports/).\n\n\n##
  3. Look ahead\n\nWith Sharesight handling the bulk of the historical work, and the
  [Future Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/future_income/) predicting
  upcoming dividends and interest payments, you can focus on your client’s future
  income and tax implications, thus planning ahead for your client instead of chasing
  down Trade Confirmation Emails and dividend statements.\n\nIf you’re not already
