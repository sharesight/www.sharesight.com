  **Tip #6 &mdash; Help with share selection for DIY investors**

  Read articles about companies of interest to you in newspapers, magazines and online. You will be surprised how quickly your knowledge and confidence grows. You can use online tools such as [Sharesight](/) to check the historic performance of a company to help you with your investment decisions.

  Look online to find the innumerable share purchase recommendations for free as well as organisations that provide recommendations to paying subscribers. Whether they are free or not these services can be a valuable source of guidance and information but don’t follow them blindly. If it is not clear to you why their recommendations are sound don’t act on them. Do your own homework and come to your own decisions.
