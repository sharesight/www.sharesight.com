  Good news! You can now login to [Sharesight](/) using your Google account details. This works for existing Sharesight clients as well as new sign ups. In a nutshell, if you use Gmail, you can use these details as a more convenient (but just as secure) method of accessing Sharesight.

  ![Google Login - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6aFwjhfIf6gCWamiEKmWAs/684b935cf13fc323fdb38cc8693e3ac4/featured_google-login.png?w=950)

  For existing clients, logging in with Google means you have one less password to remember and you'll never need to go through the "forgot password" procedure if you've found yourself logged out of Sharesight and can't remember your password.

  And for new clients, creating a Sharesight account with your Google credentials means that you don't have to enter your email address or name. Just two clicks and you're in your first portfolio!

  Regardless if you're a returning or a new client, just click the Google button on the login or registration page:

  ![Google signin button](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5bQXArPfsQomkQ4QgqIkcc/869e68e6fa78095088bd600b1f90c8b7/google_login.png?w=950)

  Then login just like you would for Gmail. If you're already logged in to Google (or logged in via Chrome), you'll be presented with a confirmation page:

  ![Google Signin](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6myjJCh82sqccEOEaUg864/c301e902cc8e20c91b170c8aa42c56ce/google_signin.png?w=950)

  Then just review the terms and conditions and click 'Accept' to get set up.

  One thing worth noting: if you're using **a non-Gmail email address** to login Sharesight this process won't work. You'll need to update your email address with your Gmail address within the My Details page of the Sharesight Account Settings menu.
