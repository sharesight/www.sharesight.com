  The highlight for August was adding support for over 12,000 UK mutual funds with 20+ years of price and distribution history now available. Weâ€™re also continuing to progressively roll out UI improvements across the application with various improvements underway on the holding detail page this month.

  ## New Functionality / Enhancements
  - Added [support for UK Mutual Funds](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-uk-mutual-funds-with-sharesight/)
  - Added new UI to manage and bulk sync trades to Xero (find under Xero settings on the Integrations tab)
  - Added franking credit field for Australian custom fixed interest investments (some hybrid type instruments pay franked dividends based on coupon rate)

  ## Broker Import Functionality
  - Added support for ETrade US trade confirmations
  - Added support for Investec trade confirmations
  - Trade confirmations are no longer rejected if they would result in a negative position, so **can now be sent through in any order**
