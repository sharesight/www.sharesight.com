:title: The top 11 Sharesight blog posts of 2017
:content: "2017 has been a massive year for content at [Sharesight](/). We published
  [91 blog posts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/) (2017 isn’t over yet, we’ve got
  more coming), sent [over 1000 tweets](https://twitter.com/sharesight), plus shared
  countless Facebook, Linkedin and Google+ posts (and don’t forget our monthly client
  eNewsletter!).\n\nLet’s take a moment to recap the top 11 posts of 2017 -- it’s
  a nice way to make sure you haven’t missed-out on anything valuable this year!\n\n###
  1. Why I use Sharesight to track my portfolio\n\nLink: [Why I use Sharesight to
  track my portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/why-i-use-sharesight-to-track-my-portfolio/)\n\nWhen
  Emily first started working at Sharesight, she set out to understand why an investor
  wouldn’t just use their broker to check how their shares were performing. She quickly
  learnt that you [can’t rely on your broker for portfolio performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/),
  and shared her very own experience in this blog.\n\n### 2. Top 3 Australian investor
  trends in 2017\n\nLink: [Top 3 Australian investor trends in 2017](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/top-3-australian-investor-trends-in-2017/)\n\nEvery
  5 years the [ASX’s Australian Share Ownership Study](http://www.asx.com.au/education/2017-asx-investor-study.htm)
  profiles investors to provide an understanding of retail investors, their perceptions,
  attitudes and behaviours. Sharesight has reviewed the report and identified three
  important trends for investors.\n\n### 3. SMSF unbundling - how much can it save
  you in 2017? \n\nLink: [SMSF unbundling - how much can it save you in 2017?](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/smsf-unbundling--how-much-can-it-save-you-in-2017/)\n\nWe’ve
  written before about the concept of SMSF Unbundling – but much has changed in the
  three years since Sharesight CEO Doug Morris wrote his original [SMSF unbundling
  post](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-unbundling-and-how-much-can-it-save-me/).
  So we recalculated how much SMSF unbundling can save you in 2017.\n\n### 4. Sharesight’s
  10 year fintech journey\n\nLink: [Sharesight's 10 year fintech journey](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesights-10-year-fintech-journey/)\n\nSharesight
  was officially formed as a company on September 3rd 2007 – making this year our
  10th birthday! Read all about our journey as a ‘fintech’ startup before the term
  fintech was coined.\n\n### 5. 3 reasons why dividend tracking is crucial\n\nLink:
  [3 reasons why dividend tracking is crucial](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-dividend-tracking-is-crucial/)\n\nMerely
  counting up the cash you receive from dividends doesn’t go far enough. Dividends
  must be factored into the bigger picture – your overall investment performance.
  To be successful, every dividend investor needs to understand these three things.\n\n###
  6. 4 ways Sharesight is better than Google Finance\n\nLink: [4 ways Sharesight is
  better than Google Finance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/4-ways-sharesight-is-better-than-google-finance/)\n\nGoogle
  recently announced that they’re shutting-down the portfolio feature within Google
  Finance. Here are 4 reasons why you should be using Sharesight instead.\n\n### 7.
  Cate Blanchett, queen of 100% investment returns?\n\nLink: [Cate Blanchett, queen
  of 100% investment returns?](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cate-blanchett-queen-of-100-investment-returns/)\n\nIn
  late 2016, it was widely reported that Blanchett [sold her Sydney house for $19.8M](http://m.realestate.com.au/news/blanchettupton-hunters-hill-mansion-expected-to-have-broken-suburb-record/news-story/c6a1bd72aabd9c58db58e3a06f70158d).
  She bought the house for $10M in 2005. Clickbait to be sure (we took a look at the
  photos – it’s a stunning house). But the return numbers are misleading, here’s why.\n\n###
  8. Announcing the Contribution Analysis Report\n\nLink: [Announcing the Contribution
  Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/)\n\nThe
