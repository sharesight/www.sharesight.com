:title: Diary of a small cap growth investor
:content: "For years now I’ve cultivated a habit of regularly appraising my own performance.
  In part, that’s because I’m an investor by trade; but I genuinely believe that it
  is a process we can all benefit from. Unfortunately, with the market in sell off
  mode, I fear my results won’t look as good as last time I did this. Here is my performance
  in the last three months:<br>\n<br>\n\n![3 month performance vs asx200](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2FBa64U66see4cQac8GKWK/4f8ccbf8e86b66d815b96b0da66119c5/3_month_performance_vs_asx200.png?w=950)<br>\n<br>\nTo
  my surprise, I’m actually outperforming the market. My opinion of myself as an investor
  is that I underperform in the down periods, and outperform in the up periods, in
  keeping with my decision to focus on highly volatile smaller companies. So I’m happily
  surprised, and interested to zoom in to see what has driven my short-term performance.\n\nFor
  the last three months, you can see my worst four performing companies by absolute
  contribution (on the left) and by percentage fall (on the right):<br><br>\n\n![Best
  worst performing ASX](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/431EPWHdu8ekuqWME02MEe/cb5330bc0b7b7afd946e52376f7b1933/Best_worst_performing_ASX.png?w=950)<br><br>\n\n\n**MNF
  Group** (ASX:MNF) is down about 20% in that time, and even though that’s not as
  bad as **Windlab** (ASX:WND), I have a much bigger investment, so it was had the
  biggest impact. My other losers (by percentage) were companies that I sold recently;
  since they no longer seem to be as attractive as I thought. **Gentrack** (ASX:GTK),
  on the other hand retains my confidence, and I actually bought a few more shares
  a a price of $5. I’ll hold off buying any more to see if it gets lower, since it
  disappointed the market with its recent results.\n\nAt this point I could look to
  my winners, but I’d rather focus on just one. **Laserbond** (ASX:LBL) was my best
  performer. It’s a very small company so its share price more reflects company-specific
  events, rather than the overall market. It was up about 60%. My turnaround play
  in **Energy Action** (ASX:EAX) was also a positive contributor (although I did sell
  some of those shares, at about $1.) The common theme is that my portfolio is very
  different from the big companies that dominate the overall market!\n\nIn my view,
  when your portfolio is down, the most important thing is to zoom out. The last two
  years looks very different from the last three months, as you can see below.<br><br>\n\n![2
  year performance vs ASX](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1GWefiQeKMq4uOouioCaaq/0c576e1a627528903585a0636557661e/2_year_performance_vs_ASX.png?w=950)<br><br>\n\nAs
  you can see, my portfolio varies, both on an absolute level and relative to the
  market. From December 2016 to October 2017, I was actually underperforming the market.
  It was a tough time, and it didn’t feel good, but I kept at it and my strategy paid
  off.\n\nFor those who are interested, you can see [my 5 year portfolio returns here](https://ethicalequities.com.au/blog/5-year-performance-review/).
  I think it makes sense to look at longer periods. In some ways, the longer, the
  better! However, I’m glad I looked at my 2 year returns because whereas my 5 year
  returns are dominated by my largest holding, [Pro Medicus](https://ethicalequities.com.au/blog/pro-medicus-asxpme-keeps-growing-fy-2018-annual-results/),
  my 2 year returns are dominated by a company I sold, **Livetiles** (ASX:LVT). You
  can see my best four performing companies by absolute contribution (on the left)
  and by percentage fall (on the right):<br><br>\n\n![best worst performing ASX 2
  years](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4lVQHmkM1y0Yegk8K8G8EC/483cba85a2e9166b46fc52556793c85e/best_worst_performing_ASX_2_years.png?w=950)<br><br>\n\nHowever,
  even with two years you can seen how the life of an investor has its ups and downs.
  When fear reigns -- or mistakes come home to roost -- our wealth shrinks and the
  process feels painful. But as long as we continue to pursue our strategy (mine is
  to buy undervalued small cap stocks), then the compounding machine that is capitalism
  should work in our favour. As Benjamin Graham famously said, \"In the short run
  the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.\" \n\nOne
  key takeaway from the book *Superforecasting: The Art And Science Of Prediction*
  is that our forecasting abilities improve with practice. And equally, it’s hard
  to improve a process if you cannot measure it. So for this reason I think you should
  measure yourself, preferably over a multi-year horizon. By keeping yourself honest
  (to yourself) you create a base to improve on, and position yourself to make the
  right decisions for you and your family. And that, after all, is what investing
  is about.\n\n*The Author of this piece, Claude Walker, owns shares in Pro Medicus,
