:title: Sharesight release notes - August 2019
:content: "August saw the release of three important improvements in our continuous
  quest to automate the recording of dividends and fund distributions as accurately
  as possible:\n\n![Release Notes August 2019](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3NFwI4cPISHdKKhxxvF3Hi/4c9c5f8df27f96fe106658538b1475b4/Release_Notes_August_2019.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Sharesight release highlights for August 2019:\n\n* We have [updated ETF distribution
  information available for the FY19 Australian tax year ](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/updated-australian-etf-distributions-now-available-for-fy19/)for
  all iShares (BlackRock), Russell Investments, ETF Securities and Vanguard ETFs from
  Sharesight partner Computershare. This means that for the majority of ETFs in Australia,
  users will not need to manually update their ETF distribution components from their
  AMMA statement using [Sharesight’s pro-rata form](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/taxable_income/#1)
  to add this information to their portfolio.\n\n* We now allow you to override the
  foreign withholding tax rate individually against each foreign holding in your portfolio.
  You’ll find this under ‘holding settings’ on the holding page. \n\n* For Australian
  users, we now have more accurate exchange rate information available for foreign
  currency dividends paid by ASX listed instruments, so that your AUD totals exactly
  match your dividend statement.\n\n### Sharesight Usability\n\n* Improved input error
  messaging on various forms.\n\n* Restyled [news feed on the holding page (and share
  checker)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/improved-stock-market-news-in-sharesight/)
  to better surface news across all content providers.\n\n### Broker Transaction Import\n\n*
  Added support for Evans & Partners International [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/).\n\n*
  Integration with Saxo Online Trading released as a beta feature.\n\n### **FURTHER
