:title: Mutual Funds vs ETFs in the UK - what are the differences?
:url_slug: mutual-funds-vs-etfs-in-the-uk--what-are-the-differences
:content: "UK investors have a long history of trusting their money to mutual funds,
  where it is pooled with the investment of others and managed by professional investors
  to a set objective. Mutual funds invest in stocks, bonds and other securities or
  a combination of asset classes. However, ETFs are increasingly competing for this
  investment spend and offer investors access to a range of shares and sectors and
  are undoubtedly one of the investment world’s biggest success stories of the past
  decade.\n\nIn this article we detail what mutual funds and ETFs are, how they differ,
  and what you need to look out for if you’re looking to invest in either in the UK.
  \n\n![Mutual Funds vs ETFs differences](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7kwDerkzC6tYxuAYPP6VhW/38752051d9fd0316a96918c383c2fdf1/Mutual_Funds_vs_ETFs_differences.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Mutual funds in the UK\n\nMutual funds offer investors access to a diversified collection
  of stocks and / or bonds across a range of sectors and markets in a single fund.
  Because the fund size is far greater than the contribution of any one investor,
  mutual funds offer scale, diversity, reduced risk and less exposure to market volatility
  than investing in a single company or industry would.\n\nMutual funds tend to suit
  more traditional \"mom and dad\" investors who are happy to pay a premium to see
  their portfolio professionally managed. These investors may also be after some of
  the more complex features of mutual funds that aren’t available in ETFs, such as
  a [regular cash flow or more tax efficient outcomes](https://www.franklintempleton.co.uk/investor/products/our-products/equity).
  The appeal of mutual funds to investors over direct investment in share markets
  can be summed up in three points: \n\n* Diversification – a range of shares, sectors
  and securities in one fund\n\n* Affordability – cheaper than directly acquiring
  many individual securities\n\n* Professional management – funds run by managers
  with experience and expertise.\n\n## ETFs in the UK\n\nLike mutual funds, ETFs are
  a pooled investment product offering investors access to a diversified collection
  of stocks and other securities like bonds. Traditionally, ETFs were designed to
  track an index, commodity or currency, allowing investors the diversification of
  a mutual fund with the trading characteristics of a security that can be bought
  or sold on a stock exchange. Unlike a fund, it can be bought or sold throughout
  the day on a stock exchange which is why ETFs are effectively a hybrid of a tradable
  stock and an index-tracking fund.\n\nIn the UK, the terms ‘ETFs’ (exchange-traded
  funds) and ‘ETPs’ (exchange-traded products) are increasingly used interchangeably
  but there are differences that investors should be aware of. [ETP is the umbrella
  term](https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/exchange-traded-products) for a range of
  exchange-traded products of which ETFs are by far the largest subset. Most ETFs
  try to follow a specific index, such as the FTSE 100, to produce the same investment
  return. Funds which do this are commonly known as passive, or tracker funds in the
  UK market.\n\nETPs can also be benchmarked to a [wide range of other traditional
  investment sectors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-products-etp.asp),
  including commodities, currencies and bonds. Some examples are exchange-traded managed
  funds (ETMFs); exchange-traded structured products (SPs); exchanged-traded vehicles
  (ETVs); exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and exchange-traded commodities (ETCs). However,
  these products are generally unsuitable for retail investors as they offer less
  protection and can use complex financial techniques, increasing the risks for investors.\n\n##
  ETFs or Mutual Funds?\n\nIncreasingly,UK investors are [pulling out of mutual funds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/it-s-not-just-america-etfs-are-invading-the-u-k-market-too)
  and moving their money into ETFs. This trend towards passive rather than active
  management is being underpinned by several factors including disillusionment with
  fund managers, price / fee sensitivity and a demand for transparency in investment
  products. \n\nHowever, investors that see merit in actively managed mutual funds
  are also moving across to newer ETFs in the form of [‘smart beta’ or active ETF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta-etf.asp)[
  products](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta-etf.asp) that are more
  akin to their mutual fund counterparts. The purpose of actively managed funds is
  to outperform a benchmark index by selecting when to buy and sell stocks based on
  the fund manager's research and expertise. Actively managed mutual funds are [much
  more common](https://www.fool.co.uk/investing-basics/isas-and-investment-funds/index-trackers-vs-managed-funds/)
  than actively managed ETFs.\n\nIn both cases a fund manager is engaged to make the
  investment decisions although the active ETF aims to outperform a benchmark index
  while a mutual fund manager usually has a far broader remit to spot market irregularities
  to the benefit of investors. This line may become increasingly blurred in the future
  as the ETF industry continues to grow in complexity and seeks greater diversity
  in both products and investment strategies.\n\n## Costs and tax implications\n\nMutual
  funds are more complex products than ETFs and this translates into higher management
  fees. Generally, t[he annual cost breakdown](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071816/how-are-etf-fees-deducted.asp)
  will include an overhead or admin fee, fund manager charges and, [if the investment
  was made before 2013](https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/trail-commission), trailing
  commission to the financial advisor or firm that sold the fund to the investor.
  \n\nOn the other hand, ETFs are generally seen as a low-cost way to earn a return
  similar to the index, commodity or currency being tracked. They can also be bought
  the same way you buy and sell shares but far more cheaply than investing directly
  in multiple listed companies. Management fees are lower, even for more actively
  managed ETFs, as competition amongst providers is fierce, there is no embedded commission
  to be paid and servicing costs are well below those of mutual funds. However, investors
  should be aware that brokers typically charge the standard stock trade commission
  for ETF purchases and sales while this cost is typically built into the mutual fund
  model.\n\nAside from service or admin fees, investors should also consider factors
  like minimum investment and tax considerations. There is generally no minimum investment
  for ETFs while this can range from a few hundred to several thousand pounds for
  mutual funds. Generally, ETF investors only face [capital gains tax measures](https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax)
  when they sell their shares while mutual fund shareholders may face capital gains
  taxes regardless of whether they sell shares. This is due to ETF shares being traded
  on an exchange, meaning there is a buyer for every seller. That might not be the
  case with a mutual fund which might need to [sell shares of the underlying securities](https://www.gov.uk/tax-sell-shares),
  triggering a capital gains tax event.\n\n## Buying and profiting\n\nMutual funds
  in the UK are usually purchased via a financial advisor or directly from the fund
  company. ETFs can be bought and sold on an exchange through a broker, just like
  a stock, with many services geared to matching buyers and sellers. In both cases
  it is prudent to do your homework and shop around before deciding. Performance,
  cost / commission and minimum purchase amount are all factors that should be taken
  into account.\n\nWith both ETFs and mutual funds investors can potentially profit
  in two ways. The first is the capital gain when selling out of a fund for more than
  you paid for it. The second is with distributions in the form of dividends, interest,
  capital gains or other income the fund earns on its investments. A mutual fund offers
  investors the option of receiving distributions in cash or, more typically, having
  them reinvested in the fund. ETFs don’t reinvest cash distributions in more units
  or shares but rather hold this cash in the investor’s account until instructed on
  how it should be invested.\n\n## Track UK mutual funds with Sharesight\n\nSharesight
