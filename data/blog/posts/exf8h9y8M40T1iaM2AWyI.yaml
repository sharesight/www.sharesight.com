:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not
  constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and should
  not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant to obtain
  the correct advice for your situation.\n\nSharesight’s [Historical Cost Report](https://help.sharesight.com/historical_cost_report/)
  enables investors to easily compare the market value and historical cost of their
  investment portfolio over any selected period. This report is a powerful tool for
  investors who need to prepare annual accounts, such as [SMSF trustees](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  or those with shares under a company or family trust, who may need to use mark-to-market
  accounting for their financial statements. \n\nTo learn more about how Sharesight’s
  Historical Cost Report helps investors prepare their annual accounts, keep reading.
  \n\n![Historical cost report feature](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6aIjoKODidevpokNTQ6Ed0/25eaac6a75c866f5f822ae82ad88f91f/Historical_cost_report_img.png?w=950)\n\n##
  1. Run the report over any date range\n\nThe [Historical Cost Report](https://help.sharesight.com/historical_cost_report/)
  allows investors to view the value of their holdings over the time period of their
  choice. For example, investors may choose to view the value of their holdings over
  the previous financial year for tax reporting or preparing [SMSF annual ](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/in-detail/smsf-resources/valuation-guidelines-for-self-managed-super-funds/?anchor=Whyassetsneedtobevalued#Whyassetsneedtobevalued)[account](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/in-detail/smsf-resources/valuation-guidelines-for-self-managed-super-funds/?anchor=Whyassetsneedtobevalued#Whyassetsneedtobevalued)[s](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/in-detail/smsf-resources/valuation-guidelines-for-self-managed-super-funds/?anchor=Whyassetsneedtobevalued#Whyassetsneedtobevalued),
  or over custom quarterly and annual periods for balance sheet preparation. \n\n![image

  2. Break down and analyse costs by their respective components\n\nIn the report,
  costs are split into a range of key components, the values of which can be arranged
  in ascending or descending order. For example, for holdings with buy or sell trades
  made during the selected period, investors can view the value of **purchases** and
  **sales**, and compare these values with the **opening** and **closing balance**
  to see how the value of their holdings at cost price has increased or decreased
  over the period. \n\nMost importantly, investors can easily compare the difference
  between the holding’s **closing balance** and its **closing market value.** This
  will determine any unrealised capital gains or losses on the holding, should you
  need to provide this information in your SMSF annual accounts, taxes or other financial
  statements. \n\n![image 2 historicalcost](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7fVkEsyAv6qioV1U6Tv21T/d9b037a23192e5b78dbd11b2b5953f16/image_2_historicalcost.png?w=950)\n\n<small>
  With the Historical Cost Report, investors can easily compare asset values such
  as the opening and closing balance, purchases, sales and closing market value. </small>\n\n**Note:**
  If you are looking for an easy way to calculate unrealised capital gains or losses
  on your investments (but don’t require it for financial accounts), Sharesight also
  has an [Unrealised CGT Report](https://help.sharesight.com/unrealised_cgt_report/)
  for Australian tax residency portfolios. For realised capital gains, there is also
  a [Capital Gains Tax Report](https://help.sharesight.com/capital_gains/) for [Australian](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/)
  and [Canadian](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/canadian-capital-gains-tax-report-makes-tax-time-easy/)
  tax residency portfolios. \n\n## 3. Take advantage of a range of advanced reporting
  options\n\n### Include brokerage\n\nInvestors can choose whether or not to include
  brokerage fees in their report, which affects the opening balance of their holdings.
  This allows brokerage to be treated as an expense if it is not included, or to be
  included in the cost base of the holdings, depending on your entity’s tax treatment.\n\n###
  Change grouping classifications\n\nInvestors can organise the holdings in their
  report by default groupings including market, sector, industry, investment type,
  country or no grouping at all. \n\n![image 3 historicalcost](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/26j8SLk10oVgmXB2ZEmM0K/4714009d4ccb592fd97282a28ddc3357/image_3_historicalcost.png?w=950)\n\nInvestors
  also have the option of applying a [custom grouping](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/)
  to their report. For example, you may wish to differentiate between individual equities,
  ETFs, managed funds and currency accounts, as seen in the screenshot below. \n\n![image
