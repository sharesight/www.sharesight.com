:title: SMSFs up 20% since 2012
:content: "Are you among the over 1.1 million Australians running a self-managed super
  fund (SMSF)? You are not alone. According to the [ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/About-ATO/Research-and-statistics/In-detail/Super-statistics/SMSF/Self-managed-super-fund-quarterly-statistical-report---March-2017/),
  there were around 491,000 SMSFs in Australia in December 2012, compared to over
  585,000 today -- an increase of almost 20% in the last 5 years. We have noticed
  the trend too, with 39% of Australians on an upgraded plan currently tracking an
  SMSF in Sharesight.\n\nThe ASX found that 30% of those not currently running an
  SMSF intend to do so in the future, with 13% planning to start their own SMSF within
  the next 12 months.\n\n>It costs very little to administer my SMSF and takes very
  little admin time. The bulk of my time is spent on deciding how to best invest the
  fund, as it should be.<br> <cite> Andrew Bird, Executive Director, [Sharesight](/)
  in [How I manage my SMSF with Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)</cite>\n\n##
  Why do Australians establish SMSFs?\n\nAccording to AMP Capital’s [Black Sky Report
  (2017)](https://www.fsadvice.com.au/media/library/FS_Advice/FS_Advice_-_AMP_Black_Sky_Report.pdf?10a41)
  the majority of SMSF investors (56%) established their SMSF to have more control
  over their investments. Believing existing superannuation options gave them insufficient
  control over factors such as portfolio [asset allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/),
  or aligned poorly with their individual [appetite for risk](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/does-your-investment-portfolio-match-your-appetite-for-risk/).
  \n\nMoreover, 32% of SMSF investors established their SMSF to choose specific shares
  to invest in. These very engaged investors could benefit from using an [unbundled
  SMSF solution](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-unbundling-and-how-much-can-it-save-me/).\n\n![featured

  How can Sharesight help you manage your SMSF?\n\nThere are four key problems SMSF
  investors need to solve to manage their SMSF using an ‘unbundled’ solution. \n\n-
  ***Execution:*** The actual buy/sell transactions that an SMSF needs to undertake
  when investing (typically through a broker such as Sharesight partner CMC markets)\n-
  ***Accounting:*** Ensuring compliance with SMSF legislation through a registered
  accountant and/or [SMSF solutions built around Xero](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-xero-for-smsfs/)
  \n- ***Research:*** Choosing shares, funds, or other investments based on your investment
  priorities (the part you will probably spend the most time on) \n- ***Portfolio
  tracking:*** Which is where Sharesight can save you time and money, automatically
  recording the data you need, and reducing the time you or your accountant need to
  spend on administration tasks. Letting you focus your time and money on the actual
  *investing* of your SMSF\n\n![Xero - Sharesight Integration](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6oUqJA4cOQSGIkqWum8SYu/2bb4cfbf83cd62e00b11924a9a055c83/Xero_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n>We
  maintain one portfolio in Sharesight for the SMSF. The allocation to the member
  accounts is done in Xero at year end. From an investment point of view, it is treated
  as one portfolio with one investment strategy.<br> <cite>Andrew Bird, Executive
