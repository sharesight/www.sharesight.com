:title: 'Morningstar Individual Investor Conference 2020: Event wrap-up'
:content: "This year’s Morningstar Individual Investor Conference had one major theme:
  How is Covid-19 impacting markets and what should investors do to safeguard their
  wealth? The US election was another key focus, along with much discussion around
  the valuation of Australian equities. \n\nThe [2020 investor conference](https://www.morningstar.com/en-au/events/miic)
  was the first to be held entirely online, spanning two days and 13 presentations.
  This included a session between Sharesight CEO Doug Morris and Morningstar’s Senior
  Product Manager Mark LaMonica, showing how investors can take advantage of the [integration
  between Morningstar ](https://www.sharesight.com/au/partners/morningstar/)[and](https://www.sharesight.com/au/partners/morningstar/)[
  Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/au/partners/morningstar/) when tracking their
  portfolio. \n\nTo find out some of the key takeaways from our picks of the top sessions
  from the 2020 Morningstar Individual Investor Conference, keep reading. \n\n![image

  The Cost of Covid: The Long-Term Impact on Markets and Economies\n\n*Diana Mousina
  - AMP Capital*\n\n### The current state of the economy\n\n* Financial markets are
  still about 15% lower than pre-Covid levels.\n\n* Wage subsidy programs are masking
  the true level of unemployment, which is about 9% globally.\n\n![image 2 Morningstar](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4Lqr1zbvekWvoMx1STSko4/5a9736fe2ba9bca79fc8020b6ce45661/image_2_Morningstar.png?w=950)\n\n*
  In this recession, females have been hit much harder than males due to the decline
  of the service industry and part-time roles. Female participation still has not
  recovered as much as male participation, with childcare arrangements also being
  a factor. \n\n### Medium to long-term\n\n* Australia’s budget deficit will move
  to about 11% of GDP - the highest level since WW2. Other countries’ deficit will
  be close to 100% of GDP.\n\n* Local manufacturing will not return to Australia because
  we are not competitive in the manufacturing space; our high cost base is unlikely
  to change. The US however, may bring some production back onshore. \n\n* Inequality
  will increase between countries and within countries.\n\n![image 3 Morningstar](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2g1PkX2uD59cJ4E4T7Nhcm/3d6ba0dd02eac41f0cd4f3db2c2559e2/image_3_Morningstar.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Australian Equities: The Valuation Conundrum\n\n*Anton Tagliaferro, Investors Mutual
  Limited & Kate Howitt, Fidelity International*\n\n### Anton\n\n* We are seeing upgrade-downgrade
  mania: Little changes in company earnings making huge share price changes. The market
  also tends to be focused on daily information flow; a short-term focus. \n\n* Long-term
  focus is valuation driven, not momentum driven. Focus is on quality, not upgrade-downgrade
  mania, and in-depth research rather than daily information flow. \n\n* People should
  be risk averse right now but instead of movement into safe value stocks people are
  buying tech stocks on enormous valuations. At some point this has to adjust. \n\n*
  There are many companies that pay good dividends but are not doing that well in
  the current stock market: Amcor, Brambles, Aurizon and Telstra. Not too expensive,
  sustainable dividends, good balance sheets, good operations, recurring cash flow
  and not cyclical like gold.\n\n![image 4 Morningstar](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4M75l5ZENIcsgTsWILDIYY/41cdc7c7a3d62a717b7c0cb91c2b7dd7/image_4_Morningstar.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Kate\n\n* There is a case for investing in companies with a higher growth profile.
  The mistake is to assume all high growth companies are on the same trajectory when
  tech companies, for example, could be disrupted in 3-5 years. \n\n* Quantitative
  easing tries to make long duration assets look unattractive, causing investors to
  look to more speculative assets. \n\n* Investors are being forced out of the bond
  market and they are bidding up prices in equities. \n\n* We will soon move from
  government handouts to encouraging investments in businesses. Things will get rocky
  domestically but compared to other countries we have had a better run with the virus
  and we started off with a great sovereign balance sheet. \n\n## Being an Engaged
  Investor in the Time of Covid-19\n\n*John Cowling, Australian Shareholders’ Association*\n\n###
  Risking your capital\n\n* Dividend yield is low right now and you’re not getting
  an adequate return on capital.\n\n![image 5 Morningstar edit2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/56swGh445QZQEZb2sUYvPv/1f0231a2e023c9c255615c61680eb03a/image_5_Morningstar_edit2.png?w=950)\n\n*
  Brokers are all telling us to buy - less than 10% recommend to sell.\n\n### Looking
  long-term\n\n* Long-term, you should be looking for sustainable business practices,
  a strong social license and great customer relationships.\n\n* The new generation
  of investors cares much more about ESG investing than older generations\n\n* Australian
  companies are ahead of the world on ESG scores.\n\n* To find investments with a
  strong social license, look to Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure
  (TCFD) framework; arabesque s-ray tool, responsible returns and net promoter score.\n\n###
  ESG and profit\n\n* Australian equities responsible share funds outperform the S&P/ASX
  300 over 5 and 10 year horizons.\n\n* ESG leaders are more resilient \n\n* ESG ratings
  on some of Australia’s biggest companies:\n\n![image 7 Morningstar](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2r3PSqQ0gfro0GiChqY1D1/dd60a667fdb50e45ad19febf53ce4885/image_7_Morningstar.png?w=950)\n\n##
  The US Election and Your Portfolio\n\n*Hamish Douglass, Magellan Financial Group*\n\n###
  Does it matter who wins? \n\n* It does matter and we will have a different world
  depending on who wins. \n\n* It comes down to what happens in the Senate. For example,
  if Biden wins the house but not the Senate. \n\n* If the Republicans keep the Senate,
  there will be little change with the Republicans acting as a check and balance on
  the Democrats. \n\n* If the Democrats take the Senate, it depends on the filibuster.
  If the Democrats remove the filibuster this could really spook markets. \n\n* Potential
  risks around Democrat plans to increase company tax rate to 28% and increased regulation
  of the tech industry. \n\n### State of the US economy\n\n* Things in the US depend
  on how they handle the pandemic. With hospitals at or near capacity they will need
  to shut down their economy again, which will require large support from governments.
  \n\n* The $1,200 stimulus cheques were very effective. \n\n* The composition of
  the market has changed. Instead of banks, which are capital intensive, there has
  been a switch to large tech companies, which skew valuations as they are less capital
  intensive. \n\n* Bond rates have been a strong driver of excess market returns,
  especially since 2008/9. \n\n* If inflation emerges and interest rates go up that
  is very negative for asset prices. Not necessarily a risk in the next 5 years, but
  with increased government borrowing it will have to create inflation at some point.
  This is the biggest threat out there for equity investors and needs to be planned
  for today. \n\n## Individual investors love Sharesight\n\nBuilt for the needs of
