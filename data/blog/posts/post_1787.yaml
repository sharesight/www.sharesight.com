:title: Hands up for a Capital Gains Tax
:url_slug: hands-up-for-a-capital-gains-tax
:content: |-
  Hopefully you all got your tax returns done on time.

  I sent mine in at the last minute as usual despite having all the hard work done for me in the [Sharesight](/) tax reports. Being able to export all my share-related data from Sharesight into [Xero](/xero/) is also a huge time-saver when it comes to preparing the annual accounts for my Family Trust. It’s a great example of the real benefits that cloud computing can deliver.

  I get caught under the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime and I shudder to think of the time I would have wasted on this if it were not for the Sharesight [FIF Report](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/).

  [Accountants](/blog/why-do-accountants-love-sharesight/) (the ones not using Sharesight) hate FIF reporting as much as their clients because it is simply not possible for them to do the required work for a fee that either they, or their clients, would consider reasonable. National seems to be reluctant to get rid of this ridiculous tax and Labour seems hell-bent on making things worse.

  Fortunately the likelihood of a more comprehensive [capital gains tax](https://help.sharesight.com/au/capital_gains/) is the same as the likelihood of Labour forming a Government after the next election. That is not to say that there aren’t some good reasons for introducing a capital gains tax. But let’s remember that our experience with FIF shows how real the objections to a capital gains tax are:

  1. **It’s expensive for taxpayers** (in time and/or accounting fees)
  2. **It's complicated** (hands up all those who understand FIF!)
  3. **It's avoidable** (avoid buying shares caught under the FIF regime)
  4. **It does not eliminate bias**
  5. **It's not cost-effective** (there is no simple solution that will raise significant tax in the short-medium future)
