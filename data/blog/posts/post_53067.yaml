  ###### NOTE: There is a newer version of this article. See [*How to calculate your NZ FIF income*](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/) for more information.

  [Sharesight](/) is designed to help investors track their portfolio performance day-to-day as well as throughout the year. And by pulling investment data from multiple sources into one place, Sharesight eliminates the paper-chasing and general headaches normally associated with tax reporting. But for Kiwi investors, it's our [FIF report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/new_fdr_report_page/) that's the real game-changer come tax time. We'll explain why, but first:

  ## What is a foreign investment fund (FIF)?
  As stated by the IRD, a foreign investment fund (FIF) is an offshore investment held by a New Zealand-resident taxpayer who holds:

  - less than 10% of the shares in a foreign company
  - less than 10% of the units in a foreign unit trust
  - between 10% and 40% of the shares in a foreign company which is not a CFC
  - an interest in a life insurance policy where a FIF is the insurer and the policy is not offered or entered into in New Zealand
  - an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme.

  It does not include interest earned from term deposits, bonds, debentures or money lent.

  ## Calculate your FIF income using Sharesight
  As a result of these IRD rules, investors who have certain types of overseas investments may have FIF income. And while the IRD has an online tool that lets you check if you are required to do anything under the FIF rules], if you determine that you do, the actual calculations can get quite tricky](https://interact2.ird.govt.nz/forms/fifcalc/. That's where Sharesight comes in. As an NZ Expert or Pro plan user, you can [run your own FIF income reports](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/new_fdr_report_page/) in just a few clicks. This allows you to:

  ### 1. Determine which of your holdings are subject to FIF
  Sharesight automatically excludes any holdings on the [Australian share exemption list 2016 IR871](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/calculators/tool-name/tools-a/toii-fif-list-aust-share-exemption-2016.html).

  ### 2. Calculate your 'Peak holding balance'
  This determines whether you exceed the FIF threshold ($50,000 for individuals)

  ### 3. Calculate your FIF income
  Sharesight calculates your FIF income under both the [Fair Dividend Rate](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/fdr_income_fif_reports_page/) method and [Comparative Value Method](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/cv_method_fif_reports_page/) (generally you are permitted to use either methodology, but check with your accountant if you are unsure as there are some exceptions).
