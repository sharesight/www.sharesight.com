:title: 2 click FIF reporting. Yes, it's this easy. Yes, it's this automatic.
:url_slug: 2-click-fif-reporting-yes-its-this-easy-yes-its-this-automatic
:content: "###### NOTE: There is a newer version of this article. See [*How to calculate
  your NZ FIF income*](/blog/how-to-calculate-your-nz-fif-income/) for more information.\n\nDespite
  being a small company, we're rather international. We count Kiwis, Aussies, Americans,
  Italians, and Germans amongst our ranks. From a billable hours perspective, our
  payroll is a dream come true for an international tax strategist, but let's leave
  that for another post. \n\n[Sharesight](/) was founded in Wellington, but for some
  of our staff it can be easy to overlook the country-specific, core (and killer!)
  features, which put us on the map. **Our [FIF Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/new_fdr_report_page/)
  is one such example**.\n\nSharesight automatically tracks IRD updates to the FIF
  investment list and will \"tick\" these investments in your or your client's portfolio.
  We even store the FIF lists for years gone by so if there's a need to, you can always
  go back in time and run FIF reports based on the official consideration list.\n\n![FIF
  Report - featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1URv4rLVqgOw6SG20mYm8U/5cb471b1d23f00033b85ed798f68b8f4/featured_fif-report.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Run
  FIF with two clicks. No exaggeration.</small>\n\nWhen you're ready to get your FIF
  on simply go to our Reports menu, and click FIF Report. Sharesight will default
  to the current year's list, and scrolling down the page will reveal which of your
  holdings must be considered for FIF. **The ticked holdings are pre-selected by Sharesight**.
  You can always un-tick these, but we recommend leaving the list as-is.\n\n![FIF
  Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6OiapEPu00ccC0MOaqY2kK/421718b4b1e5b591e5c44e1e122ab197/FIF-report-2.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Tick,
  tick, tick - we auto nominante holdings for FIF consideration</small>\n\nClick the
  big 'Calculate' button at the bottom of the page and we'll show you the [Comparative
  Value](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/cv_method_fif_reports_page/) and [Fair Dividend
  Rate](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/fdr_income_fif_reports_page/) methods so you
  can compare each side by side. You'll want to select the lower of the two income
  calculation models.\n\n![FIF Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6gyal6aNTGykoYmWgCEWs8/5cbc1cf9f32a1fd75c6a9fe498e97257/FIF-report-3.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Compare
  both income calculation models and pick the lowest</small>\n\nFrom here you can
  take a deeper dive. Clicking any of the 'View Details' links will then display the
  underlying holdings and explain how we arrived at our Total Income. Remember, you
  can export this data to Excel or PDF and [add your logo](https://help.sharesight.com/applying-your-logo-to-reports/)
  if you're a [Sharesight Pro](/pro/) partner.\n\n![FIF Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/aVBvCcmVb22qKKgEMQ2YY/1839af4b5e932668a9f23bd2237ae68c/FIF-report-4.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Taking
  a deeper dive into one of two FIF calc methods</small>\n\nIf you need ***even more***
  **detail**, click the 'Worksheet' button and we'll reveal the underlying calculation
  for each holding.\n\n![FIF Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6B6FzLGfS0sWcOE0O4WqKG/eb07830e3a8170a65ff71a1266b5b835/FIF-report-5.png?w=950)\n\n<small>The
  guts of our FIF reporting engine</small>\n\nWe're proud of the work we've done on
  our FIF Report. It's this end-to-end automation you should come to expect from Sharesight.
  Don't expect us to stop here. There's plenty more country-specific automation in
  the works...\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- Help -- [FIF Report](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/new_fdr_report_page/)\n-
