  With over a thousand accounting industry professionals in attendance, Xerocon Auckland was definitely the place to be last week for anyone interested in the future of cloud accounting. In fact, the energy inside the Viaduct Events Centre was so contagious that it even spread to Twitter, with [#Xerocon](https://twitter.com/search?q=xerocon&src=typd) quickly becoming a trending topic in NZ soon after the conference kicked-off on Thursday morning!

  If you've been following us for a while, you know we're not one to miss out on all that Xerocon excitement. So a few members of the Sharesight clan packed their bags and flew over to Auckland to attend the conference, meet with attendees, and provide one-on-one demos of our award-winning portfolio admin & reporting tool.

  <small>Sharesight portfolio champions, Lulu & Vanessa</small>

  We love Xerocon. Not only do we get to meet switched-on accountants and bookkeepers, but it also gives us a chance to catch up with our mates at Xero and at the other companies that make up Xero's vibrant Add-on ecosystem. There are so many good things happening in this space at the moment. We've said it before and we'll say it again: it's an exciting time to be in the cutting-edge cloud finance industry.

  The conference wrapped-up with what is arguably the highlight of all Xerocon conferences: the annual gala awards dinner, where [Xero unveils its regional Partner Award winners](https://www.xero.com/blog/2015/05/winners-unveiled-at-xero-nz-partner-awards/). Sharesight was honoured to be named as a finalist for Add-on Partner of the Year, along with [Spotlight Reporting](https://www.spotlightreporting.com) and [Quotient](https://www.quotientapp.com). While we would have loved to win, we were super excited for Spotlight Reporting when they walked onto the stage to accept the award, as it brought back warm [memories of us winning Australian Add-on Partner of the Year in 2014](/blog/sharesight-wins-xero-add-partner-year/). A huge congratulations to Spotlight Reporting and all the Xero NZ Partner winners!
