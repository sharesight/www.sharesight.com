:content: "###### The below article is for informational purposes only and does not

  not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser or accountant
  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\n*Late June 2016. Summer in Europe.*\n\nI
  was sitting at a trading desk in Jersey, Channel Islands. The media, the financial
  community, David Cameron, Mark Carney (governor of the Bank of England) had all
  warned of the terrible risks should the UK vote to leave the EU.\n\nAnd even at
  the betting shops, the money — in total — was well against Leave.\n\nMy colleague
  Raj, a forex specialist felt different. And he also had a handle on the conversations
  of older people across England.\n\n‘They’re going to vote to leave,’ he said. No
  shadow of doubt in his voice.\n\nI was struggling to believe him. ‘Want to bet on
  that?’\n\nWe didn’t end up putting any money down. At least not until the next day.
  When the pound fell to levels not seen since 1985. And David Cameron resigned.\n\n![Brexit
  Markets](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/sbr8PtnFItAeR9rzPMCRD/4bd5686d618d938a3dc1e8df5b1738fe/Brexit_Markets.jpg?w=950)\n\nHad
  you been able to predict this, you could have liquidated high positions earlier.
  And bought after the Brexit crash.\n\nThat year, purchases of the crushed pound
  and crumbled FTSE stocks at bargain-basement prices went on to boost my portfolio.
  In July, things bounced back, and for the rest of that year, it was a good place
  to be.\n\n## Macro events drive opportunity, especially with forex\n\nOne thing
  I like about [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com) is that it tracks currency
  gain. \n\nWhen investing globally in stocks, there are three drivers of return:\n\n*
  Favourable movement in forex pair\n\n* Capital gain in the share price\n\n* Dividend
  income\n\nIn my experience, trading of most currency pairs gets driven by short-term
  traders and their instant interpretations of events. Hence the sell-off of sterling
  against USD, AUD, NZD and a number of other currencies got overdone.\n\nThen the
  mainstream media predicts more dire consequences than is usually the case. When
  Boris Johnson took the Leave mantle from Theresa May earlier this year, the pound
  suffered for months.\n\nBack in July, when Johnson took over the leadership of the
  government, we were buying GBP.NZD at 1.85.\n\nThe New Zealand economy was softening.
  And the Brexit risk (and dire warnings from the financial mainstream) was well overdone.\n\nAs
  I write, GBP.NZD is up around 1.94. GBP.USD around 1.23.\n\nBut there was another
  even more telling area that observers could have used to predict the Brexit outcome.
  If you looked at betting shops up and down the UK, the quantum of money was on Remain.
  However, by actual number of individual bets, you could see that Leave was actually
  ahead.\n\nTo invest well, you have to stay curious. You have to pull back the layers
  and bias on what’s reported by journalists and regulators, most of whom are not
  traders or investors.\n\n## Look beyond company guidance\n\nYou now need to find
  assets and instruments to profit from market trends. And as you’re most likely using
  *Sharesight*, my guess is you favour stocks in quality companies. So do I.\n\nOf
  course, investor reports, presentations, analyst ratings and so forth are useful.
  But they’re often tipped in favour of buying the company’s shares. You know that
  line about barbers and haircuts, don’t you?\n\nWhat’s more interesting is to undertake
  some outside analysis:\n\n* Run a search for competitors. How are they doing? Are
  they taking ground? What do they have in store?\n\n* Review job vacancies and advertisements
  from your target company. Are they hiring? How much do they pay? How do former employees
  review them? There are a couple of sites online that rank employers.\n\n* Who are
  they looking to employ? Marketing hires make me the most nervous. Since it can often
  mean the business needs an additional — usually costly push — to go further in the
  marketplace.\n\n* On the other hand, if the business is looking to employ numerous
  operational staff to fulfil the goods or services they provide — that can be a good
  sign. But it can also warn of skill shortages.\n\n* Connect with people in the business
  and get a sense of how they feel about things. In the case of one UK pick, I sent
  a quick message via LinkedIn. It answered a key question I had.\n\nAnd there are
  many other alternative areas you can look into that conventional analysts combing
  annual reports often miss.\n\n\n---\n\n\n###### Simon is the publisher at *Wealth
