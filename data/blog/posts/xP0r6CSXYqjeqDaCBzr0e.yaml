:title: Brokerage fees and your investment performance
:content: "Sharesight aims to provide investors the complete picture of their investment
  performance. Because of this we include factors like brokerage and the impact of
  foreign exchange movements when calculating performance, as these can have a material
  impact on your investment returns.\n\nTo illustrate why this is important, we thought
  it would be helpful to dive into our user data and examine just how big an impact
  these costs are having on returns. Read on to learn more.\n\n![Brokerage Fees Investment
  Performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/XdZ65jVHJmScNVEKbAzbq/c22659bcf2a2899e650bd733a0fbc885/Brokerage_Fees_Investment_Performance.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Brokerage costs among Australian investors\n\n[Brokers with zero-commission trading](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/brokers-with-zero-commission-trading-have-changed-investing/)
  have changed investing, particularly in the USA, but among Australian brokers, with
  the exception of [Stake](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/stake-clients-can-now-easily-track-trades-using-sharesight/)
  (who specialise in US stocks), the move to low (but not zero) commission trades
  on the ASX has been driven by [CMC Markets](https://help.sharesight.com/import-your-historical-trading-data-and-sync-your-cmc_account/)
  and [Selfwealth](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-selfwealth-trades-into-sharesight/)
  who have moved costs down to around the AU$10 mark.\n\nWith this trend towards low-commission
  brokers, let’s look at the data for Sharesight users in Australia who made a minimum
  of 10 trades on the ASX from 2017 to Oct 2020 to see how much brokerage fees impact
  their returns.\n\n![Broker Cost Trade Value](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1vVKbzCIckgZYtfldVnJLE/018688d81c583f872d2869689dc9b0f4/Broker_Cost_Trade_Value.jpg?w=950)\n\n###
  Australian brokerage cost data trends\n\n1. From 2017 to 2020, we see a consistent
  decrease in the average brokerage fee per trade. This highlights a shift in investor
  behaviour towards lower brokerage fees per trade. From 2017 to 2020, the average
  brokerage fee per trade has decreased by ~9% (From nearly $20 to just under $18).\n\n2.
  Brokerage fees as a percentage of the trade value show a similar trend, with a decrease
  of ~10% in 2020 compared to 2017. \n\nInvestors (on average) are taking advantage
  of lower brokerage costs to trade on the ASX, as well as decreasing the impact of
  these fees on their investment returns (through increasing their trade size, lowering
  brokerage cost, or both) are both trends in the right direction.\n\n## Why Sharesight
  factors brokerage costs to your performance figures\n\nTo provide investors with
  the complete picture of their investment returns, Sharesight takes into consideration
  a number of factors when [calculating your investment performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  -- including brokerage costs.\n\nLet’s look at the impact of the average brokerage
  cost from the above dataset to illustrate why this is important.\n\nFor the average
  investor, the brokerage to trade value was at 0.72%. This means that you need the
  stock to increase by 0.72% just to make up the cost of the buy trade.\n\nBased on
  these figures, this would be $18 brokerage on a $2,500 trade, or $9 on a $1,250
  trade. Plus, for investors to realise a capital gain they need to both buy AND sell
  the investment in question, which is two trades, they’d need to double this cost,
  with the percentage impact to returns closer to 1.4% which is not an insignificant
  sum. \n\n## Sharesight gives you the complete picture of your investment portfolio\n\nNot
