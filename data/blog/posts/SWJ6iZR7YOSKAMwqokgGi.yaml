  giving them access to Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/)

  Sharesight allows investors to effortlessly track *all of their investments in one
  place*.\n\n![Robinhood Sharesight portfolio tracker 0](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/35GpURj3k2YPSvXvhphavV/55d7898fb9d113dda9057aeb0434e1c8/Robinhood_Sharesight_portfolio_tracker_0.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Who is Robinhood Financial?\n\nEstablished in 2013, [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/)
  is a US-based broker with an online trading platform that offers ‘zero commission
  trading’ on US-listed securities. The platform has grown in popularity after offering
  commission-free trading in [Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies](https://crypto.robinhood.com/).
  Other key features include the ability to purchase fractional shares, as well as
  research tools such as earnings calendars and the ability to view the top 100 most
  popular stocks on the platform. \n\n## Why you should track your Robinhood trades
  with Sharesight\n\nBy importing your Robinhood trades to Sharesight along with the
  rest of your portfolio, you can effortlessly track the price and performance of
  your investments across different brokers, asset classes, markets and currencies
  – *all in one place*. Investors will also benefit from Sharesight’s [15 minute delayed
  pricing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/)
  for key US markets, plus the ability to automatically track [dividend payments](https://www.sharesight.com/au/dividend-tracker/),
  including [dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  (DRPs) and [upcoming announced dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/).
  Access to a powerful range of reports such as Performance, Portfolio Diversity and
  Multi-Currency Valuation is just another reason that investors should consider using
  Sharesight to track their investment portfolio.\n\n## Import trades via Sharesight’s
  Trade Confirmation Emails feature\n\nSharesight’s [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n**Note:** Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  does not support automatically importing Robinhood cryptocurrency trades as their
  trading confirmation emails do not provide us with enough data to correctly record
  the trade. However, you can still track these trades manually with [Sharesight’s
  cryptocurrency tracking feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/).\n\n##
