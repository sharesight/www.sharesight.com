  _Every week we post a tip that we hope will help you become a successful share market investor._

  **Tip #5 &mdash; How to choose industries with good prospects**

  Some simple high-level thinking will quickly highlight industries with good potential. Hereâ€™s a few leading questions to get you thinking. There are plenty of other prospects as well.

  - Will the world suddenly stop wanting the output of the Australian mining industry, or NZ dairy products?
  - What are the implications of our aging population for retirement villages, rest homes, optometrists, dentists and providers of other medical services?
  - Will tourists suddenly stop coming to Australia and NZ in ever increasing numbers?
  - Does our banking industry have a good track record? (Hint: think APRA and the 4 pillars policy)
