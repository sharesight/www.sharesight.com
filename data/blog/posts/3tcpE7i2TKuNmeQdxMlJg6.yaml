  May was a bumper month for the product team, highlighted by the release of some important security enhancements allowing you to view all of your logged in devices and remotely sign out each device individually from within your Sharesight Account settings (click on "Manage your devices" on your My Details page). It’s also now possible to [remember your device for 30 days when using our 2FA functionality](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/secure-your-sharesight-account-with-two-factor-authentication/), so you can take advantage of added security without the added hassle!
