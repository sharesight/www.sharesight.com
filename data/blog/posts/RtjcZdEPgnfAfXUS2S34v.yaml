:title: What is an Open-Ended Investment Company (OEIC)?
:url_slug: open-ended-investment-company-oeic-explained
:content: "Open-Ended Investment Companies or OEICs are collective investment vehicles
  established as companies that have evolved as an alternative to Unit Trusts in the
  UK. These funds offer investors a professionally managed portfolio of pooled funds
  that can invest in a range of underlying securities according to a predetermined
  investment strategy. OEICs have some similarities to both Unit Trusts and Exchange
  Traded Funds (ETFs) and all three options should be considered by those investors
  looking to outsource the day-to-day management of their investment capital.\n\n![Open-Ended
  Investment Company (OEIC)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/TmFj10tbS5HN2vPD0Wu18/fc7812c9022dbb10ea396c347b4e47f5/Open-Ended_Investment_Company__OEIC_.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is an OEIC?\n\nOEICs are close relations to European SIVAVs or US Mutual Funds
  in that they are designed to allow investors to [access a diversified and managed
  portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oeic.asp) in a relatively cost-effective
  and tax-efficient manner. OEICs are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and
  the price of the shares are based largely on the value of the underlying assets
  – be these stocks and / or other securities – of the fund. OEICs are described as
  \"open-ended\" because they can create new shares to meet investor demand and will
  cancel shares of investors who exit the fund. This allows these funds to easily
  adjust both their investment criteria and fund size.\n\n## What role does the regulator
  play?\n\nAs an open-end investment vehicle, investors can freely purchase and sell
  shares of their selected OEIC with the value of the shares owned reflecting the
  net asset value of the underlying assets. OEICs can be purchased directly or through
  a broker, fund supermarket or independent financial adviser and are [regulated by
  the Financial Conduct Authority](https://seic.com/sites/default/files/SEI_UK_OEIC_EU.pdf
  ). This places several limitations on the OEIC investment framework that investors
  should be aware of. For example, FCA rules require that each OEIC is ‘sufficiently
  diversified’, meaning an actively managed OEIC may not hold more than 10% of its
  total value in the shares of any one company. Further, the aggregate of any holdings
  over 5% must not exceed 40%. OEICs may hold up to 20% of their value in units or
  shares of a single collective investment scheme, like other unit trusts or open-ended
  investment companies.\n\n## How do investors buy OEICs?\n\nOEICs are easy to access
  either directly online, from a fund provider or broker or via a financial adviser.
  They can be held inside tax-efficient wrappers such as an [Individual Savings Accounts
  (ISAs)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-is-an-isa-in-the-uk/) or Self-Invested
  Personal Pensions (SIPPs). Investors can also choose between lump sum and / or regular
  monthly payment into their OEIC. An OEIC must either distribute or accumulate the
  whole of its distributable income for a particular distribution period, either as
  dividend income or as interest.\n\n## How are OEICs taxed?\n\nOEICs and unit trusts
  have many similarities as collective investment vehicles and share the same tax
  treatment. For a UK resident, gains on shares in an OEIC are [only taxable when
  the shares are sold](https://techzone.abrdn.com/anon/public/investment/Guide-Taxation-of-Collectives)
  and in-built profits are taxable as gains, unlike some structures where the profit/gain
  may be taxed as income. Therefore, any capital growth when an investor sells or
  disposes of units/shares may be [subject to capital gains tax](https://www.money.co.uk/guides/what-are-oeics.htm).
  This also includes fund switches although switches between different share classes
  within the same fund, for example switching between income and accumulation shares,
  are not treated as a disposal for CGT. Tax is only payable where gains in the tax
  year exceed t[he annual CGT allowance of £12,300](https://www.tilney.co.uk/news/what-a-change-to-capital-gains-tax-could-mean-to-uk-investors).
  This allowance has been fixed at £12,300 until April 2026. For individuals, the
  gain is added on top of their total income to determine the rate payable. Any part
  of the gain which falls within the basic rate tax band is taxed at 10% and the balance
  will be taxed at 20%.\n\n## OEICs vs Unit Trusts\n\nUnit trusts and OEICs have plenty
  in common in that they are both open-ended and the price of each unit (unit trust)
  or share (OEIC) depends on the net asset value of the fund’s investment portfolio.
  Both can generally invest across a wide range of asset classes, geographies and
  sectors. Dividends in OEICs or unit trusts can be paid out as income or reinvested
  in the fund. [The major difference is in pricing](https://eqi.co.uk/info/articles/diy-magazine/unit-trusts-vs-oeics)
  as unit trusts quote a bid price (to redeem) and an offer price (when you buy) with
  a spread that aims to ensure new or redeeming investors don’t dilute the value of
  existing investors’ units. [OEICs only quote one price](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2001/nov/13/factsheetsoninvestmentfundsbondsandtrusts.investinginshares)
  each day, making it easier for investors to understand. Several unit trusts have
  converted to the more modern OEIC structure over the past decade and this trend
  is expected to continue.\n\n## OEICs vs ETFs\n\nETFs are generally funds that passively
  aim to mirror the performance of an index such as the FTSE100 in the UK. An ETF
  trades on the stock exchange, so they can be bought and sold like shares in a company.
  While traditional fund structures such as unit trusts and OEICs are still popular,
  the ETF industry's rapid rate of growth indicates that younger investors are increasingly
  using ETFs as an alternative way to access markets. As with OEICs and unit trusts,
  ETFs fall into the category of [pooled investment vehicles](https://www.barclays.co.uk/smart-investor/investments-explained/funds-etfs-and-investment-trusts/whats-the-difference-between-an-etf-and-a-tracker-fund/)
  and are regulated in a similar way. Most of the differences between ETFs and OEICs
  relate to the way that each product is traded. While traditional funds are bought
  and sold via the fund manager or a financial adviser, ETFs trade on an exchange
  like shares with investors buying and selling them through a brokerage account.
  And while OEICs are usually priced once a day, ETFs can be traded on the major stock
  exchanges at any time during the trading day and their prices fluctuate throughout
  the day just like shares. A passively managed ETF will almost certainly be cheaper
  than an actively managed traditional fund, but it may not be cheaper than a passively
  managed mutual fund. \n\n## Track investments in OIECs with Sharesight\n\nIf you’re
