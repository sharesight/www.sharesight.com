:content: "Canadian investors can automatically track their **tax-free savings account
  (TFSA)** in a Sharesight portfolio, inclusive of [cash deposits and withdrawals](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/)
  as well as income from investments in stocks, ETFs and mutual funds. This makes
  it easy to track the performance of all your investments in one place, while taking
  advantage of Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting. To learn more about TFSAs and how you can track them in Sharesight,
  keep reading. \n\n![Track your TFSA with Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1P4ynTiekKc6JA5HXOnZLD/bb5c9c0df999e3b6a619b9f47a03c90b/Track_your_TFSA_with_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is a TFSA?\n\nIntroduced in Canada in 2009, a [tax-free savings account (TFSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-free-savings-account-tfsa.asp)
  is an account in which individuals who are 18 or over with a valid social insurance
  number can put aside money tax-free. Money deposited as well as income earned in
  the account (such as interest, dividends and capital gains) is non-taxable and can
  be withdrawn tax-free. While a TFSA is a form of savings account, it can also hold
  certain investments including mutual funds, shares and bonds. \n\n## How to track
  your TFSA in Sharesight\n\nTo track a TFSA in Sharesight, Canadian investors can
  simply [set the tax entity of their portfolio to ‘TFSA’](help.sharesight.com/changing-the-tax-setting-of-your-portfolio/).
  This can be done by accessing the Settings menu and clicking ‘Tax settings’. By
  setting a Sharesight portfolio to ‘TFSA’, this means that all Canadian payouts will
  be considered non-taxable by default (which can be overridden if necessary), however
  non-resident withholding tax will still apply. \n\nAs can be seen in the screenshot
  below, a TFSA can be tracked in Sharesight just like any other portfolio type, with
  the ability to automatically track capital gains and dividends from investments,
  plus see the value of any deposits or withdrawals by [tracking a cash account](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/cash-accounts-now-sync-transactions-with-your-portfolio/).
  Investors can also [benchmark](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmark-your-portfolio-against-any-stock-etf-or-fund/)
  their TFSA against any one of the 240,000 global stocks, ETFs and funds that Sharesight
  tracks, which is a good way of understanding the TFSA’s performance in a broader
  market context.  \n\n![TFSA Sharesight portfolio5](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3i39Q702fIYAoWPk6ADDLT/772c716c1933d97b08145fd24c1c0762/TFSA_Sharesight_portfolio5.jpg?w=950)\n\n<small>

  as non-taxable by default and not appear on the Taxable Income Report. Non-resident
  withholding tax still applies.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n## Track your investment
  performance across all of your accounts\n\nWith Sharesight, not only can Canadian
  investors track the performance of all their TFSA investments, but they can also
  track the performance of all their different accounts in one place. This is made
  easy with Sharesight’s [Consolidated Views](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/)
  feature, which allows investors to see performance across all their portfolios in

  could be useful for investors running the [Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/),
  [Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/calculate-investment-portfolio-diversification-sharesight/)
  or [Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  reports, as it allows investors to view the asset allocation and top-performing
  investments across all their portfolios at a glance. \n\n## Start tracking your
