:title: How a Swiss accountant uses Sharesight Pro to track international portfolios
:url_slug: swiss-accountant-sharesight-pro-track-international-portfolios
:content: "We talk to Paul Kümin from [HMT Partners](http://www.hmt-partners.ch/)
  about how the Swiss-based accounting consultancy uses [Sharesight Pro](https://www.sharesight.com/pro/)
  to track clients’ international investment portfolios. We also discuss why the new
  [Multi-Currency Valuation Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/)
  is so useful, and why Sharesight Pro is the best tool for clients with investments
  across different banks, markets and currencies. \n\n![HMT case study Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4dQv6DUufWFv1fOCWCpVhT/16d265043c957c69ae9edefa744424ea/HMT_case_study_Sharesight.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  1. Tell us about HMT Partners and what you do there. \n\n[HMT Partners](http://www.hmt-partners.ch/)
  is a Swiss company that specialises in accounting, payroll administration, tax and
  consulting services for national and international customers. It is a small company
  owned by my partner, who does the account bookkeeping while I work more as a part-time
  consultant and specialist for accounting and consolidation projects.\n\n## 2. What
  made you decide to use Sharesight Pro? \n\nI had been using Sharesight for my private
  investments for about half a year when my partner got a new client with a huge investment
  portfolio. I think it’s running at CHF 32 million now, spread out over several banks
  – a big accounting challenge because everything would be in different currencies
  and for account/bookkeeping purposes in Switzerland you need to have everything
  in Swiss Francs. I told her I know this very neat web tool called Sharesight, which
  I’ve been using because I was so annoyed about spreadsheets and the inability to
  handle foreign exchange differences correctly. \n\nMost of the tools or tutorials
  you find on the web are written or built by Americans and they don’t have that issue
  [of handling foreign exchange differences]. They think in US dollars, while Switzerland
  is very different because the share market is not that big here and everybody invests
  in foreign currencies. \n\n>In my private portfolios I had like 7, 8 or 9 different
  currencies. And I was so annoyed because I couldn’t see that – no spreadsheet ever
  gave me the information of how much money I was making or losing on the investment
  itself and what was the impact of the foreign exchange. Sharesight gives me that.
  \n\nSo since last summer, we’ve put everything our main client has in terms of portfolios
  onto Sharesight Pro and shared access with him. I think we have one or two smaller
  clients also going into Sharesight now, but it’s mainly one big client that is a
  very large engagement for us. \n\n## 3. How does Sharesight Pro add value to your
  clients?\n\nSharesight Pro is clearly additional value for our bookkeeping service
  package. Sharesight is just about the only tool I know that gives us the ability
  to track historical Forex results on individual investments or whole portfolios.
  And out of that you get something that is very valuable to the client. \n\nI think
  our main client used to have somebody in India who was tracking his investments,
  because we would get some questions like, \"How did you come up with this profit
  and loss position in your profit and loss statement?\" And we haven’t heard anything
  like that now for several months. So I think he saved some money elsewhere because
  he got the information for free from us. \n\n## 4. Which features do you find the
  most useful?\n\n### Multi-Currency Valuation Report\n\nThe introduction of the [Multi-Currency
  Valuation Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/)
  is excellent. This is really something we need because our main client thinks in
  US dollars but as his company’s in Switzerland we have to do our books in Swiss
  Francs. There are also several other clients, most of them Russian or from the Middle
  East, who think in US Dollars or Bitcoin. I have to be able to track everything
  in multiple currencies, so the Multi-Currency Valuation Report is just fantastic.
  I’m really quite excited at the speed you have in introducing new features, solving
  problems and answering questions. \n\n### Other reports\n\nWe also use the [All
  Trades Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/view-and-export-your-trading-history-with-the-all-trades-report/)
  and the [Performance Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/)
  regularly. We use these reports to reconcile our bookkeeping with Sharesight. At
  the end of every month, we get all the trading vouchers from all the portfolios
  and reconcile everything. \n\n### Consolidated Views\n\nWe use the [Consolidated
  View](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/) because we run several different
  portfolios for every different bank just to make reconciliation easier. Our main
  client has six active banks right now but he’s not thinking in six banks – he wants
  to know what the big picture is. So the Consolidated View is very important. \n\n<div
