:content: |-
  We know from the feedback that we get that the biggest challenge for many investors is getting their portfolio set up in [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/). So one of our goals is to make it as easy as possible for you to get your data into (and out of) Sharesight. We recently released some improvements to our [CSV file importer](https://help.sharesight.com/import-from-csv-file/) to allow you to import historical foreign exchange (or FX) transactions (including cryptocurrencies) to your Sharesight account.

  ## Tracking foreign exchange investments in your Sharesight portfolio

  We recently introduced [Sharesight’s Foreign Currency tracking feature](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-foreign-currency-on-sharesight/) to allow investors to track foreign exchange accounts with intraday prices updated at 5 minute intervals, plus the ability to denominate brokerage fees in the currency being traded.

  Currently 32 worldwide currencies can be tracked using the FX account feature – [plus 8 cryptocurrencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-with-sharesight/) – with additional currencies to be added in the future.

  ## Import your historical FX transactions to Sharesight

  The first step is getting a list of all of your FX transactions into a spreadsheet. Thankfully this is easier than it sounds as most online brokers allow you to export a copy of your trading history in a form that can be opened up in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.

  Provided that your spreadsheet contains one row per trade and one column per attribute (price, quantity, date, brokerage, etc) it is now much easier to import this data into Sharesight.

  Sharesight’s [Import bulk trades via CSV](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/) feature lets you map foreign exchange transactions to a currency account holding for each currency held. Once imported you’ll be able to track the value of your FX holdings with prices updated every 5 minutes.
