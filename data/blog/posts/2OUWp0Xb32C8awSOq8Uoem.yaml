:title: Sharesight in numbers
:content: "###### This post is part of Sharesight's 10 year anniversary series. Scroll
  down to the *Further Reading* section for every post in the series or read [Sharesight's
  10 year fintech journey](/blog/sharesights-10-year-fintech-journey/) post to get
  started.\n\nJust over a year ago I joined the [Sharesight](/) team in Sydney. I
  work in the digital marketing team with a focus on analytics and insights, so needless
  to say I am always “in the data”. So with Sharesight turning 10 years old this month,
  I thought it would be a great moment to share some interesting numbers with you.\n\n![Sharesight
  infographic - 10 year anniversary numbers](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1u19hLGUWYeeoegw0woCC2/d2d878fa7747f82c1f79678184faddba/sharesight-10_infographic.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Sharesight currently tracks $1.9B USD worth of investments \n\nWell actually, we’re
  tracking a lot more than that! $1.9 Billion USD<sup>1</sup> is just based on active
  portfolios in the last 30 days<sup>2</sup> from our top five countries -- Australia,
  New Zealand, Canada, the UK, and the US. We actually have clients in over 50 countries,
  but I’ll share more on that in my [next post](/blog/snapshot-of-a-global-fintech/).\n\nEmpowering
  investors with their [true portfolio performance](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/)
  so they can make smarter decisions is our bread and butter. For example, Sharesight
  clients may [benchmark](/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/) their portfolio
  against popular indices, and run powerful [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  [Contributions Analysis](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/), and
  [Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/) reports. Taking it a
  step further, they can even leverage our [Custom Groups](/blog/announcing-custom-groups/)
  feature to organise investments by their preferred [asset allocation methodology](/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/).
  We’re confident that these powerful performance reporting tools help contribute
  to our clients’ performance.\n\n## A new trade is added to Sharesight every 24 seconds\n\nThe
  average Sharesight client tracks 42 holdings per portfolio and trades an average
  of 62 times. And a new trade is added to Sharesight every 24 seconds. Whether via
  a one-time [broker import](https://help.sharesight.com/importing-your-trading-history-directly-from-your-broker/),
  ongoing [broker connection](https://help.sharesight.com/sharesight_connect/), [contract
  note](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/), or [manual import](https://help.sharesight.com/setting-up-your-holdings/),
  Sharesight makes trade tracking and overall portfolio admin a breeze.\n\n## Sharesight
  clients are tracking 724,199 individual holdings \n\nYes, you read that right: Sharesight
  currently tracks nearly three quarters of a million individual holdings! That translates
  to almost 38,000 different instruments -- with price, corporate action, and dividend
  data going back as far as 20 years. Try doing that with a [spreadsheet](/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/)!\n\n##
  Sharesight clients on premium plans active in the last 30 days are currently averaging
  a 36% per annum return\n\nWe began looking at average per annum (p.a.) returns for
  our clients to see if they vary from country to country, between clients on a Free
  plan vs. our Premium plans, etc. We’ll share more insights soon but for now we’ll
  leave you with this: Sharesight clients on premium plans who have been active in
  the last 30 days are averaging a 36% p.a. return. While this sounds amazing, it’s
  important to remember that there are outliers and portfolios have been created at
  different times. Watch this space!\n\nWhile I like to think that these numbers speak
  for themselves, the best way to really see what Sharesight can do for you is to
  [sign up for a free account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)!\n\n*Stay
  tuned for our blog post later this week where we ask Sharesight co-founder and CTO
  Scott Ryburn about [his experience building the company over the last 10 years](/blog/qa-with-sharesight-co-founder-and-cto-scott-ryburn-on-10-years-of-sharesight/).*\n\n<small>\n<sup>1</sup>
