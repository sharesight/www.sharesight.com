:title: How your broker’s performance numbers mislead you
:url_slug: how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you
:content: "As an investor, knowing the true performance of your investment portfolio
  is crucial. You may ask, \"Why do I need Sharesight to track my performance? I already
  get those numbers from my broker.\" The truth is, while most brokers provide some
  form of performance metrics, these metrics are typically reduced to daily price
  movements and capital gains measured from the stock’s purchase date. \n\nUnlike
  most brokers, Sharesight gives investors the full picture of their performance by
  calculating returns on an annualised basis, including the impact of **capital gains
  and losses**, **dividends**, **brokerage fees** and **currency fluctuations**. With
  the ability to track the performance of more than 240,000 stocks, ETFs and funds
  in [over 40 major global markets](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-global-exchanges-sharesight/),
  Sharesight is the perfect place to track *all of your investments in one place*.
  \n\n![Broker vs Sharesight 0](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3Uu4nk6fiWt9jGky4JJ7DH/937b85a75b90f8e6d5f4e0517ed33c14/Broker_vs_Sharesight_0_.jpg?w=950)\n\nThis
  post will explain why your broker’s performance numbers are misleading, and how
  Sharesight provides investors with the true picture of their returns. \n\n## Brokers
  don’t consider the impact of time\n\nIf you look at the performance figures provided
  by your broker compared to Sharesight, you will notice a key difference: brokers
  tend to focus on daily price movements and capital gains since the holding’s purchase
  date, while Sharesight provides you with [annualised returns](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/).
  For example, here is a table representing the performance data given by a typical
  broker for a small basket of stocks:\n\n| Code      | Last price     | Net avg.
  price     | Cost     | Market value     | Day gain     | P&L     | P&L %     |\n|
  ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------
  | ---------- |\n| CHC       | 12.260       | 10.316       | 1,485.56       | 1,765.44
  \      | —       | 279.88       | 18.54%       |\n| CSL       | **↓**260.120       |
  290.931       | 2,036.52       | 1,820.84       | -11.83       | -215.68       |
  -10.51%       |\n| NDQ       | **↑**28.120       | 27.563       | 4,796.00       |
  4,892.88       | 13.92       | 96.88       | 2.02%       |\n| STW       | **↓**63.750
  \      | 56.208       | 2,979.00       | 3,378.75       | -12.72       | 399.75
  \      | 13.42%       |\n\n<small> Performance numbers for a small basket of stocks
  and ETFs, pulled from a typical broker. </small>\n\nAs you can see, the broker puts
  a lot of emphasis on daily price changes. While this could be useful if you’re just
  trading on these daily price swings, it’s essentially useless for calculating your
  investment performance over the long term. Fortunately, some brokers also show you
  your capital gains or losses to date, as seen above under ‘P&L’. This figure is
  handy to know, but it is meaningless for comparing the performance of one investment
  to another.\n\nHere is what the same trades look like in Sharesight: \n\n![stocks
  in Sharesight 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6xZQD5glzYDXSu3oF4vsKy/fbc6df5bae3556c130e6c87b48f263e5/stocks_in_Sharesight_1_.png?w=950)\n<small>
  The same stocks in Sharesight, with a slight difference in the price due to Sharesight’s
  20 minute delayed live pricing. </small>\n\nWith Sharesight, returns are calculated
  by default on an annualised basis. Why is this important? Let’s look at the example
  of Charter Hall (ASX: CHC) above. The broker lists capital gains as 18.54% since
  the stock’s purchase date, which was in 2019. In the past year however, this stock
  achieved capital gains of 30.4%. This annualised performance figure is meaningful,
  because it allows an investor to directly compare the performance of this investment
  to other holdings in their portfolio over the same period, as well as hypothetical
  investments they could have made instead. \n\n## Brokers don’t track dividends\n\nIn
  most cases, dividends are the responsibility of the share registries or stock transfer
  agents, not brokers. This means if you want to keep track of how much you’re earning
  inclusive of dividend income, you will need to source this information from paper
  statements, share registry websites or a combination of both. \n\nIt is important
  to [keep track of dividend income](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  because it can have a significant impact on your returns. This can be seen from
  the screenshot below, which shows an LSE stock with dividends contributing to 5.52%
  of the total return against capital losses of -10.14%, resulting in a net total
  return of -4.62%. \n\n![Dividend returns Sharesight 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4KqbscSORgJaW3BJLtequ9/16e97b692d41fb93f24716e058967d88/Dividend_returns_Sharesight_2_.png?w=950)\n<small>
  An example of an LSE stock where dividends contribute significantly to returns.
  </small>\n\nSharesight automatically [tracks dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/),
  including the option to track [dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)
  (DRPs) with the Auto Dividend Reinvestment feature, and view upcoming dividends
  that have been announced with the [Future Income Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/).
  \n\n## Brokerage fees are ignored\n\nWith most brokers relying on brokerage fees
  and other transaction costs as a source of profit, it makes sense that they don’t
  call attention to just how much these fees impact your returns. Brokerage fees can
  certainly add up, especially in proportion to small trade parcels or in large portfolios
  filled with trades. With Sharesight, you can record your brokerage fees for each
  trade, with these costs being included when calculating your capital gains. \n\n##
  Currency fluctuations are not factored in \n\nAnother important element that most
  brokers fail to include in their performance numbers is the impact of foreign currency
  fluctuations. This can have a significant impact on returns for anyone who invests
  globally, as can be seen in the screenshot example below, which shows a stock holding
  where foreign currency contributes -24.90% to the total return against 78.51% capital
  gains and 1.14% dividends, resulting in a net total return of 54.75%. \n\n![Foreign

  stock in a non-US portfolio. </small>\n\nWith Sharesight, users can track the performance
  of their investments in [over 75 different currencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-investments-in-fx-currencies-with-sharesight/)
