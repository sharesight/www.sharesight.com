:title: What is a Portfolio Manager? Part two
:url_slug: what-is-a-portfolio-manager-part-two
:content: "In my last blog I promised to explain [how you can become your own share
  portfolio manager](/blog/what-is-a-portfolio-manager-part-one/) and:\n\n1. Take
  control of your investments\n2. Improve your investment performance\n3. Save dramatically
  on fees\n4. Enjoy becoming a DIY investor\n5. Achieve all this without ruining your
  evenings and weekends\n\nOn reflection this seems like a ‘big ask’ but I’ll give
  it a go.\n\nTo retain a sense of proportion and keep things in perspective it helps
  to remember that when it comes to share market investing there are only 3 key activities.\n\n1.
  Decide which stocks to buy and sell.\n2. Do the buying and selling.\n3. Maintain
  a detailed record of your investments.\n\nIt is also important to note that just
  because you are managing your own portfolio does not mean you can’t engage professional
  assistance with some or all of these activities. And before you ask, no, this does
  not mean you might as well engage a professional manager and be done with it because:\n\n1.
  You are in control. You choose people to fill in the gaps. You decide who you want
  and what you want them to do.\n2. You can select specialists who do one thing and
  do it well.\n3. Even if you opt for significant professional help, the cost is likely
  to be significantly less than using a professional portfolio manager.\n\nLet’s have
  a quick look at each of the three key activities in turn. This is not the place
  to go into great detail but hopefully it will give you some insight into whether
  being your own portfolio manager is for you.\n\n### Deciding which stocks to buy
  or sell\n\nThis is the bit that makes most people nervous and jittery. The two key
  reasons for this are that the share market is well known for &nbsp;its ups and downs
  and inexperienced investors lack confidence when it comes to deciding which shares
  to buy.\n\nWe are currently running a blog series entitled *[Tips for becoming a
  successful share market investor](/blog/tips-for-becoming-a-successful-share-market-investor-tip-1/)*.
  I suggest you read these. They are brief and to the point and hopefully they will
  give you the confidence to take the plunge. Our tips focus on doing it yourself
  but if you want to supplement this with professional help there are some excellent
  share recommendation services to which you can subscribe. Choose one that is upfront
  with their track record and shows how each of their recommendations has performed
  since the date they recommended it -- including stocks they have subsequently sold.\n\n###
  Buying and Selling\n\nThe good news is that buying and selling shares is straightforward
  and relatively inexpensive. Just sign up with an [online broker](/blog/tips-for-becoming-a-successful-share-market-investor-tip-7/)
  and you are good to go. \n\n### Maintaining a record of your investments\n\nThe
  bad news **(except that it doesn’t have to be bad news at all -- see below)** is
  that for most people record keeping is a real pain that takes the fun out of investing.
  As your portfolio grows record keeping does have the potential eat into your evenings
  or weekends.\n\nFor most of the year you can stick your contract notes and dividend
  statements in a shoe box or leave them languishing in your inbox and hope the problem
  will go away. But that causes stress and worry because you know that at the end
  of the financial year you will have the tax man on your tail and he won’t be a happy
  camper!\n\nThere’s another problem too. If you do not keep good records, how are
  you going to know how well your shares are performing?\n\nFortunately help is at
  hand. To make the bad news good news all you have to do is sign up to [Sharesight](/).
  Sharesight will automate your record keeping, produce all the data you need for
  the tax man, and your accountant if you have one, and give you a detailed and accurate
  record of how your shares are performing.\n\nAnd here’s the really, really good
  news. If you have shares in 10 or fewer companies Sharesight is **FREE.** No ifs,
  no buts, no maybes, no time limits.\n\n**SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?**\n\n### FURTHER
