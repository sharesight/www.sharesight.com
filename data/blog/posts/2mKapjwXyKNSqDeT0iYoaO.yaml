:title: Track your investment watchlist stocks with Sharesight
:content: "It’s easy to track your **stock watchlist** using Sharesight, with the
  ability to monitor the price and performance of over 170,000 stocks, ETFs and funds
  in [more than 36 leading global markets](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  Unlike tracking a watchlist through a spreadsheet or your broker, Sharesight automatically
  records the impact of **capital gains/losses** and **currency fluctuations** on
  a stock’s returns. Investors can also get **stock price information** at a glance,
  with live pricing (20 minutes delayed) for the ASX and NZX, and end-of-day pricing
  for all other markets. This makes it effortless for Sharesight users to spot value
  buying opportunities in their watchlist. \n\n![Track your investment watchlist stocks

  Track multiple investment themes easily in one watchlist\n\nFor investors who like
  to track different \"themes\" in their watchlist, [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  is a useful feature that allows you to classify your stocks into the categories
  of your choice. In the screenshot below, for example, the Custom Groups feature
  has been used to classify a watchlist into BNPL stocks, large-cap stocks and penny
  stocks. This is an easy way to compare the price and performance of stocks in different
  themes, and find new buying opportunities that align with your investment strategy.
  \n\n![Watchlist themed stocks 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4wBjVLJ61W0b6x9bZRtGw6/4470196caf6f167f326d09f9fbed9480/Watchlist_themed_stocks_1.png?w=950)\n<small>

  Track overseas investments including foreign exchange\n\nTracking foreign investments
  in your watchlist is made simple with Sharesight, which automatically calculates
  the impact of currency fluctuations on your stocks. The screenshot below, for example,
  shows a currency loss of 1.22% or $18.31 AUD on approximately $1000-worth of Apple
  (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares over a one-day period (since market close). \n\n![Watchlist

  An example of a watchlist stock where foreign currency has an impact on returns.
  </small>\n\nThis is useful for investors who need an easy way to evaluate the price
  and performance of global stocks in their watchlist, converted into their local
  currency. As can be seen in the screenshot, investors can also view the latest foreign
  exchange rate for their chosen stock. \n\n## View stock price information at a glance\n\nInvestors
  tracking their watchlist with Sharesight will benefit from the ability to view detailed
  price information at a glance. For investors who look to hit specific price targets
  before buying into a stock on their watchlist, clicking into individual stocks in
  your Sharesight portfolio will bring up a chart of the stock’s price performance
  over the time period of your choice. Sharesight users can choose different time
  periods by accessing the dropdown menu at the top of the Holdings page, which includes
  options to track price movement over a wide variety of periods, such as over a one-day
  period (from market open or close), since last login or over a one-week period,
  for example. \n\n![Watchlist weekly price tracking 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2KqfM2hlScIYfDU9M8rKAt/08517a99abd26bdd0f54d723adb47380/Watchlist_weekly_price_tracking_3.png?w=950)\n<small>
  An example showing the price movement of Afterpay (ASX: APT) over a one-week period
  in a live stock market watchlist. </small>\n\nActive investors will also benefit
  from Sharesight’s live pricing data (20 minutes delayed) for ASX and NZX stocks,
  and end-of-day pricing for all other markets. Sharesight users can view the latest
  price of any stock in their watchlist by scrolling down to the \"Instrument Detail\"
  section on the Holdings page. \n\n### Automated stock price alerts by email\n\nAnother
  useful feature for investors tracking their watchlist on Sharesight is the ability
  to opt-in to [price alert emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-sharesight-email-alerts-you-should-enable-today/).
  Users who opt-in to these notifications will receive an email if the closing price
  of one of their holdings differs from the opening price by more than 5%. This is
  a convenient feature for investors who target buying opportunities based on percentage
  changes in a stock’s price, or investors who want to stay updated on volatility
  and sudden movements in their watchlist stocks. \n\n## How to track your investment
  watchlist with Sharesight\n\nTo build a stock watchlist using Sharesight, simply
  follow these steps: \n\n1. If you’re not already using Sharesight, sign up for a
  [free account](https://sharesight.com/signup).\n\n2. Build your watchlist by using
