:content: "With Sharesight, investors can easily track more than 30,000 stocks and
  ETFs on the **London Stock Exchange (LSE)**, with price and performance updates
  on a [15 minute delayed basis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/).
  This is in addition to Sharesight's support for key European markets such as the
  [SIX Swiss Exchange (SWX)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-the-swiss-tokyo-stock-exchanges/),
  Deutsche Börse [Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FRA)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/global-markets-available-singapore-frankfurt-johannesburg/)
  and EURONEXT, plus over [40 other global markets](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/)
  including leading US exchanges. Sharesight’s extensive market support allows investors
  from around the world to track *all of their investments in one place*, while providing
  them with powerful performance reports, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n## What is the London Stock Exchange? \n\nThe [London
  Stock Exchange](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/) (LSE) is the primary stock
  exchange of the United Kingdom, as well as the biggest stock exchange in Europe.
  Established in 1801, the LSE is also one of the world’s oldest, most diverse and
  international exchanges. In 2007, the LSE merged with the [Milan Stock Exchange](https://www.borsaitaliana.it/homepage/homepage.en.htm),
  the Borsa Italiana, creating the [London Stock Exchange Group](https://www.lseg.com/).
  \n\n## Why investors should track their investments on the LSE with Sharesight\n\nWith
  Sharesight, investors can easily [track the price and performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  of stocks, ETFs and funds listed on the LSE alongside investments across multiple
  global markets, brokers and asset classes. By consolidating all of their investments
  in Sharesight, investors gain a portfolio-wide view of their investment performance,
  benefitting from [intraday pricing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/)
  for the LSE, plus advanced reporting designed for the needs of self-directed investors.
  In addition, Sharesight’s [annualised performance calculation methodology](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  gives investors the complete picture of their portfolio returns by calculating the
  impact of capital gains, brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and [foreign exchange rates](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  on performance.\n\n### Track dividend income from LSE stocks \n\nUnlike other portfolio
  trackers, Sharesight automatically [tracks dividend and distribution income](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and includes this information when calculating your investment return. In the screenshot
  below for example, dividends make an important contribution to this stock’s returns,
  highlighting the value of a portfolio tracking solution that includes more than
  just capital gains in its performance calculations. \n\n![BP holding dividend tracking

  </small>\n\n### Run powerful performance reports built for investors\n\nFor investors
  who want a more detailed breakdown of their portfolio’s performance, Sharesight
  offers a range of powerful reports including: \n\n* **[Performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-your-investments-with-sharesights-performance-report/):**
  Calculate your total portfolio returns over any selected period.\n\n* **[Diversity](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/):**
  Discover how the assets in your portfolio are diversified across different investment
  sectors, investment types, countries and markets. \n\n* **[Contribution Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/):**
  Measure the impact of your holdings and asset allocations on your overall portfolio
  performance. \n\n* **[Future Income](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-see-upcoming-dividends-with-sharesight/):**
  View announced dividends and interest payments expected for investments in your
  portfolio. \n\n### Calculate the impact of LSE investments on your portfolio’s returns
  \n\nIn the screenshot below, you can see the [Contribution Analysis Report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  (sorted by market) being used to assess the ‘weight’ of various markets in a UK
  investor’s portfolio. This would be particularly useful for an investor looking
  to compare the relative contribution of their LSE investments to the total return
  on their portfolio, for instance. \n\nIn this example, the LSE is the most significant
  contributor to the portfolio’s value, constituting 40.35% and £21,771.21, while
  the biggest detractor is the EURONEXT, which constitutes -21.45% and -£11,574.14.
  The report also includes a detailed breakdown of each individual holding’s returns,
  classified by market. \n\n![Contribution Report sorted by Market London Stock Exchange](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3if1EnEm55CS1WfCO3u3qo/dc2fca7578ee9919aa5d1cc2ce5755bd/Contribution_Report_sorted_by_Market_London_Stock_Exchange.PNG)\n<small>
