  that appears\n\n![Google FInance Portfolio Hack](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4GYYjx34h2cEQwGSyIya0W/99ec1352176f9bd77ae9b866447b4277/Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_3.35.28_pm.png?w=950)\n\n*We’ve
  tested this as of Friday February 2nd 2018 and it is still working as a workaround,
  but will update this blog if anything changes.*\n\n## I’ve downloaded my Google
  Finance OFX file - now what?\n\n1. [Sign-up for a FREE Sharesight account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)\n2.
