  We recently expanded the functionality of the Consolidated Views feature within [Sharesight](/). Read on to learn what’s changed, and how to leverage these changes to gain additional insights into your investment portfolios.

  ## What is a Consolidated View?

  The Consolidated View feature allows you to “group” multiple portfolios within Sharesight and run a selection of reports across them:

  For more information on Consolidated Views (including the differences between a Portfolio and a Consolidated View), visit our help page on *[Using Consolidated Views](https://help.sharesight.com/consolidated_views/)*.

  ## What’s changed?

  Once you’ve created a Consolidated View, you may then:

  ### 1 -- Group by Portfolio

  This expanded functionality allows you to easily compare the performance of portfolios at a glance, without having to switch back and forth between them.

  From the [Portfolio Overview page](https://help.sharesight.com/show_portfolio/), select “Group by: Portfolio” from the advanced options menu:

  This will chart your consolidated, as well as individual portfolios:

  It will also group your holdings by portfolio, and display their individual returns:

  The "Group by Portfolio" setting is also now available on the following reports:

  - [Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  - [Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/)
  - [Sold Securities Report](https://help.sharesight.com/sold_shares/)
  - [Historical Cost Report](https://help.sharesight.com/historical_cost_report/)

  ### 2 -- Run a Contribution Analysis Report

  You may now also run a [Contribution Analysis Report](/blog/announcing-the-contribution-analysis-report/) on a Consolidated View:

  ![screenshot - Consolidated View - Contribution Analysis Report](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/79tfdjiwZGGQo8MS00Kwoe/58e35db8820fd221c0e025e6e6a4fa89/screenshot_consolidated-view_contribution-analysis-report.png?w=950)

  Previously unavailable for Consolidated Views, the Contribution Analysis Report provides insights into the drivers of your portfolio’s performance, be they particular stocks, [assets](/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/), or exposure to certain countries, sectors, or industries. In the example above, we’re learning which sectors have had the biggest impact on our family’s consolidated portfolio returns.

  For more information on this feature, visit our [Contribution Analysis Report](https://help.sharesight.com/contribution-analysis-report/) help page.
