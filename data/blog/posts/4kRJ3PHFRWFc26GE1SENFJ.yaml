:content: "One of Sharesight’s most popular reports, the [Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  measures a user’s investment performance over any chosen period. Unlike most brokers,
  Sharesight gives investors the true picture of their returns by taking into account
  key factors such as the impact of [brokerage fees](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/brokerage-fees-and-your-investment-performance/),
  [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and [capital gains](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/),
  allowing Sharesight users to make  more informed investing decisions. \n\nThe Performance
  Report includes a number of important features, such as custom date ranges, grouping
  by asset type and the ability to easily export and share the report with an accountant
  or financial advisor. To learn more about how to make the most out of the Performance
  Report, keep reading. \n\n![image 0 Performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/40wVap4by52aMcBDt7RoTj/c9239cf6c84b000efcc2b1d6080e44f5/image_0_Performance.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Sharesight’s Performance Report\n\nOne of the key advantages of Sharesight’s Performance
  Report is that investors can clearly compare the performance of different assets
  in their portfolio over the time period of their choice. This is particularly useful
  for investors with mixed-asset portfolios and global investments who will benefit
  from seeing the cumulative impact of [capital gains](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-calculator-for-australian-investors/),
  [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and [currency](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/intraday-foreign-exchange-rates-now-on-sharesight/)
  on their returns. \n\nWhile most brokers simply state the difference between the
  buy and sell (or current) price, Sharesight considers the above factors to [calculate
  returns on an annualised basis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/).
  This is done so that investors can see the *complete picture of their investments*
  and understand how an allocation of capital has performed over the time it has been
  invested. \n\n![image 1 Performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5PEJ1SkAbbQVxsoOvFVjso/a93a26055321d809b41ec3ac208836a9/image_1_Performance.png?w=950)\n\n<small>The
  Performance Report is ideal for investors with mixed-asset portfolios and global
  investments.</small>\n\n## Key features of the Performance Report\n\nSharesight’s
  Performance Report has a number of features allowing investors to customise how
  their investment performance data is displayed. Here are some of the key features:\n\n###
  Custom date ranges\n\nLocated on the top left-hand corner of the report, users can
  select the date range of their choice to calculate their portfolio’s returns. For
  example, an investor may choose to run reports over the last calendar year and the
  current calendar year to compare their returns and see how they are tracking towards
  their performance goals. Or if they have sold a stock, they may want to use custom
  date ranges to compare the performance of their portfolio before and after the sale.
  There are endless ways to evaluate your performance using the report’s suggested
  periods or choosing your own custom date range. \n\n![image 2 Performance edit](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/15PJcGgSp5NFZBgzV1CL44/b47c87989959f841c1e9baff40117175/image_2_Performance_edit.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Toggle options\n\nUsers have the option to toggle between showing open and closed
  positions, or just open positions, as well as the option to view returns in monetary
  or percentage values.  \n\n![image 3 Performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/40vJySq1FxJG6f8rf2DnUb/95a8b59e3324d9e275176f4213182af4/image_3_Performance.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Groupings and filters\n\nThe Performance Report allows users to group their holdings
  based on classifications such as sector, industry, country or even [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/),
  which is a powerful way to view performance by any grouping an investor specifies..
  \n\n![image 4 Performance edit](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5hHqc1JtqZW6Bk5SBFzJtG/21cfb6edbf1796c68b1923de86b1794c/image_4_Performance_edit.png?w=950)\n\nUsers
  may also choose to filter their results by creating custom labels such as ‘high
  growth’ or ‘dividend stocks’ to break down the performance by their own custom dimensions
  in combination with or separate from their own Custom Groups.\n\n![image 5 Performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/F3zQjXpVLD7DwIfZdN1R4/52246b8ce6856cab627b0557f4052a8c/image_5_Performance.png?w=950)\n\n###
  File exporting\n\nOne of the most convenient features of the [Performance Report
  is the ability to export it](https://help.sharesight.com/exporting-a-report/) in
  a range of different file formats, such as a PDF, XLSX spreadsheet or Google Sheets
  file. This is userful if you want to view the report in another format or share
  it with your accountant/financial advisor. \n\n## Start tracking your investment
