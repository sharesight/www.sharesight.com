:title: Why does finance hate technology?
:url_slug: why-does-finance-hate-technology
:content: "You’d be hard-pressed to find an industry less affected by technology than
  finance. Or should we say more affected given its defensive posture? Whether it’s
  low-level lending or investing, things are still paper-based and run on bankers’
  hours. Recently, [Sharesight](/) opened an online brokerage account for testing
  purposes and we had to go into the bank branch to finalise setup. After being pitched
  a credit card, a home loan, and a savings account, we huffed out after 40 minutes
  of pain (and still haven’t placed a trade).\n\n![Why Does Finance Hate Technology
  - Featured](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2LGc2EFq8om8UwycGIcgig/c4f2d7e077b7a3bbc95149da5483ac81/featured_finance-hates-technology.jpg?w=950)\n\n<small>At
  least this was entertaining</small>\n\nA [recent article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/10867119/The-Silicon-Valley-of-fear.html)
  in The Telegraph (UK) provides a snapshot on the state of play:\n\n> Finance is
  one of the few areas that technology companies, which are defined by their almost
  limitless ambitions, have made few inroads in. Although internet and mobile banking
  have become must-have services, the vast majority of customers continue to favour
  the high street brands that have existed for decades. While the internet has changed
  many aspects of media, retail and communications almost beyond recognition, areas
  of lending, insurance and investing are unchanged from 20 years ago.<br><cite>James
  Titcomb, [The Silicon Valley of Fear](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/10867119/The-Silicon-Valley-of-fear.html)</cite>\n\nIndeed
  the only areas of improvement we’ve seen are in everyday transaction accounts. Most
  of the major banks’ mobile apps are very good, as is peer-to-peer money transferring.
  PayPass is also a convenient development. But in the States, for example, paper
  cheques are still widely used for recurring payments. Waiting seven days for a cheque
  to clear puts a bit of a crimp in your cash flow. \n\nThe old-school areas of funds
  management and financial advice remain the most unchanged save for a few website
  facelifts here and there. This is a shame and an opportunity squandered. By using
  technology, investment companies could be targeting young people who are just beginning
  to invest and tech-savvy folks already in retirement, a.k.a. the “Silver Surfers.”\n\n[Scaled
  advice](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/your-money/sites-to-manage-personal-wealth-gaining-ground.html),
  for example, holds promise. [Our partners at Stockspot](/blog/announcing-new-strategic-partner-stockspot/)
  have already put something similar in motion. Scaled advice companies offer online
  financial advice, using algorithms to select an appropriate mix of investments based
  on an investor’s personal data.\n\nOrwellian this is not. Truth be told these algorithms
  are very similar to what the average financial planner would recommend based on
  a risk profiling engine, but a hell of a lot cheaper (fees being the best predictor
  of future returns). By looking at a list of investment options, scaled advice providers
  work out the best mix of investments considering salary, returns, risk, fees, and
  client expectations. If applied to index funds or ETFs, this model is hard to beat
  for young investors looking to build up core investments.\n\nSpecifically, we think
  this model has huge potential for industry super funds, in which there’s already
  a direct relationship with the end client and where commissions to intermediaries
  less of a factor. If clients are given a decent range of investments to choose from,
  that’s even better. Australian Super’s Member Direct plan being a prime example.
  They allow clients to invest in any company in the ASX 300 and a range of ETFs.
  Adding a scaled advice option on top of this would make sense. Paying a tiny per
  annum fee for a recommended investment mix and automatic rebalancing sounds like
  a fair deal to us.\n\nAn inverse product could be applied to those people who are
  in retirement. Why don’t asset management companies build a product that would help
  people find the right “glide-path?” Chances are, people could leave funds invested
  longer (increasing AUM fees, optimising tax, etc.) versus cashing out their entire
  nest egg in one go, thereby ending their relationship with the financial institution.\n\nOn
  a visit to a US-based financial planner last year at one of the world's largest
  banking institutions (30,000+ financial planners), a Sharesight employee enjoyed
  the following exchange:\n\nAdviser: \"Use Mint.com to organise your spending habit
  info and then email me your login details, but make sure you send them to my personal
  email address\"\n\nSharesight employee: \"Why? You guys don't have anything better
  in-house to track that stuff down?”\n\nAdviser: \"Ha! Our technology sucks. Take
  a look at this screen.\"\n\nThe adviser proceeded to turn his computer monitor,
  which showed an interface that looked like [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS).\n\nInstead,
  this person has shared his Sharesight portfolio with the adviser, thereby eliminating
  the need to track down his investment holdings all over again. Plus, there's no
  need to awkwardly share what should be private login credentials with someone else.\n\n**We
  can’t change the entire industry overnight, but we can empower investors to take
  an important first step: freeing their portfolio data.**\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n-
