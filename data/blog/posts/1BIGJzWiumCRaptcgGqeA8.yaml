:content: "Welcome to the March 2021 edition of the Sharesight20USA monthly trading
  snapshot, where we look at Sharesight users’ top 20 trades in US stocks on the Nasdaq,
  NYSE and [AMEX](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/)
  over the month. \n\nIn this Sharesight20USA snapshot, buy trades were strongly led
  by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which has seen steadily declining share prices since February.
  At the same time, sell trades were led by GameStop, which produced mixed Q4 earnings
  results that caused share prices to surge once again. Other top trades included
  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Nio (NYSE: NIO).\n\n##
