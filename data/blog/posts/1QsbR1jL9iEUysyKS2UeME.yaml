:title: Yahoo Finance vs Sharesight -- comparing portfolio trackers
:content: |-
  If you’re an investor that owns stocks on both local and international markets, tracking the performance of your portfolio is often beyond the scope of most portfolio trackers. Often this means [tracking your portfolio manually using a spreadsheet](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/7-reasons-why-sharesight-is-better-than-a-spreadsheet/), or alternatively Yahoo Finance, but there’s a better way — here’s 3 reasons why investors should be looking for a Yahoo Finance alternative:

  ## 1. Misleading performance

  Like [most brokers](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/), the major issue with Yahoo Finance is that it only calculates your *simple return* — the difference between what you paid for the stock, and what it’s worth now. That’s bad because **you can’t compare the relative performance of investments in your portfolio** if you've owned them for different periods, to do that **you need to calculate annualised returns** instead.

  See that +60.87% total gain figure in Yahoo Finance on this 2015 investment in General Motors? On an annualised basis that has seen capital growth at a rate of 8.7% p.a.

  ![Screenshot - Yahoo Finance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4obOSrGOdTlDzi5OriruKB/799e183ac950d362402387f1a1f95e32/Screenshot_-_Yahoo_Finance.png?w=950)

  Sadly, this is the most misunderstood concept when tracking investment returns. Once you start tracking your investments using an [annualised calculation methodology](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/), you’ll finally understand your *true* performance. This gives you the data-driven insights that allow you to make better investment decisions, (and hopefully become a better investor in the long-term).

  ## 2. Doesn’t factor in dividends

  Other factors that impact performance are brokerage fees, foreign currency fluctuations and corporate actions such share splits and dividends. Sadly, Yahoo doesn’t allow you to [track dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/) either. If you own dividend-generating stocks and attempt to track them in Yahoo finance, your performance numbers will quickly go askew.

  Remember that 8.7% annualised capital gain I talked about earlier? Here it is again. But **once you factor-in the impact of dividends** on your investment performance, the annualised return figure jumps to 12.43%:

  ![GM - Dividend + Cap Gain](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7vGwBR2GkObkuZ1Ew5FbR1/03bf20725d2fe1c3bb05da994a3ab3e3/GM_-_Dividend___Cap_Gain.png?w=950)

  As you can see, [dividends play a huge part in your performance return](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-dividend-tracking-is-crucial/). And what about[ dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/)[ (DRPs or DRIPs)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/), which let you use your cash dividends to purchasing additional shares in a company without paying commissions? These have an additional impact on your performance (and are yet another component of your performance that you can’t track using Yahoo Finance).

  ## 3. Doesn’t track the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations

  If you’re investing internationally, knowing the impact of forex changes on your investment return is yet another part of the equation to understanding your true performance. Sharesight tracks the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on your portfolio, Yahoo Finance does not.

  Returning to our example above, if this was an an international investor based in Australia with an investment in GM stock on the NYSE, you also need to consider any change in foreign exchange rates since the original purchase. When you factor in forex impacts **the total annualised return actually figure is 10.42% p.a.:**

  ![GM - Currency Gain](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7J0L1zxXzcsT1Zqdl1sIY9/4f2de13d903ca49765d1d28d1ad7d526/GM_-_Currency_Gain.png?w=950)

  ## Why investors should use Sharesight instead of Yahoo Finance

  Yahoo is a great place to check your old [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) email. But when it comes to tracking your investments, you should be using a purpose-built portfolio tracker like [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com), which not only tracks your annualised performance, but includes dividend tracking, tax reporting, plus wealth of other features specifically designed for DIY investors. Here’s a side-by-side comparison of Yahoo Finance and Sharesight to show you what we mean:
