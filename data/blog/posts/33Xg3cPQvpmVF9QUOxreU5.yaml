:title: How to record inherited shares in your portfolio
:content: "\n###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only
  and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice
  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant
  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nOften attributed to Benjamin
  Franklin is the famous quote: \"*Nothing is certain except for death and taxes*\".
  Share inheritances combine these two certainties in a painful way. The grief of
  losing a loved one is difficult enough, but then comes the administrative burden
  of figuring out estate-related capital gains and tax information.\n\nIn this article
  we’ll cover a few things you might need to know should you inherit shares, as well
  as how to track those shares in Sharesight.\n\n![How to record inherited shares
  in your portfolio](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6UVd5IOU670Hf5fcLpnoLw/fe653be6945b8767815fcdc646d510d8/How_to_record_inherited_shares_in_your_portfolio.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Do you pay tax on inherited shares?\n\nThe date of death of the relative who left
  you the shares is important to note. Many countries have inheritance or estate taxes
  at either the federal or state level. Among the OECD countries, the range varies
  from 55% in Japan and South Korea, to 0% in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn Australia
  you don’t have to pay any tax when inheriting shares or funds, but you may be liable
  for CGT if you sell them.\n\n## Tax after you inherit shares\n\nGenerally speaking,
  a capital gains event occurs whenever there is a transfer of ownership. The only
  exception is inheritance (it may be called by a different name depending on the
  country). After you have inherited shares, they need to be tracked in your portfolio.
  If the shares pay dividends, the income they generate will be taxed at your marginal
  income tax rate, and should you sell the shares, you will have to pay capital gains
  tax if your country has CGT laws in place.\n\n## How do I calculate the cost base
  for inherited shares?\n\nShould you decide to sell a parcel of inherited shares,
  you will need to calculate the cost base for tax purposes. The cost base is the
  price at which the shares were bought.\n\nHere’s an Australian example to explain
  the cost base for inherited shares. John lost his father on 13 July 2018, leaving
  him an inheritance that included a parcel of CBA shares. John’s father had bought
  3000 CBA shares at $23.10 in 1999. The share price has gone up significantly since
  then, but the cost base of those shares is recorded as of the date of the original
  purchase by John’s father.\n\nAnother Australian example is that of Sarah. Sarah’s
  mother left her 200 shares in BHP on 13 June 2018, which she had acquired in 1980.
  In this case, because the original asset was acquired [before 20 September 1985](https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Guide-to-CGT-2000/?page=192)
  when CGT was introduced in Australia, it is not subject to capital gains tax.\n\nIn
  Canada however, the [fair value of the shares is assessed](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/shares-funds-other-units/identical-properties/property-you-inherit-receive-a-gift.html)
  on the date they were inherited when calculating the cost base for a parcel of shares.\n\n##
  How to track inherited shares and funds in Sharesight\n\nInheritances have their
  own set of record-keeping requirements. For this purpose, it’s a good idea to track
  them separately from your other investments.\n\nThere are 2 features in Sharesight
  that can help achieve this outcome: Custom Groups, and Labels. \n\n### Sharesight
  Labels\n\nUsing the [Labels feature in Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/labels/),
  John can create a label called \"Inheritance\" in his portfolio, and assign his
  200 BHP shares to that label. The label helps him identify the shares at a glance,
  and he can use the label to run the [Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/)
  on the particular holdings or exclude them to calculate the performance of his own
  “true” portfolio.\n\n![Sharesight Labels](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/83XmSpTzdqsq85Xo6vTQz/436195aa6d9e62db205213266420c8ed/Sharesight_Labels.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Custom Groups\n\nUsing the [Custom Groups feature](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/),
  a Sharesight user can visualise the group s/he has created. In this example we created
  an \"Inheritance\" group in Sharesight, as shown below.\n\n![Sharesight groups](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7bn9KFHO2mYM2XEw4rJpB7/4be8188c90a76ffa080d6536e6390f5d/Sharesight_groups.png?w=950)\n\n##
