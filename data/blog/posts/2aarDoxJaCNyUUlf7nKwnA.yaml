:title: Are Australian investors investing in Asia
:content: "###### Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and
  does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice and
  should not be relied upon as such. Please consult with your financial adviser or
  accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.*\n\n*(This article was
  originally published the the [Australian Shareholders' Association](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/asa/)
  print magazine, [Equity](https://www.australianshareholders.com.au/equity).)*\n\nAustralians
  are renowned for being enthusiastic travellers, keen to discover the wonders of
  the world. Yet when it comes to investing, we tend to be homebodies.\n\nThe ASX
  has great investment opportunities, however, according to the International Monetary
  Fund, Australia represents just 1% of global GDP (based on purchasing power parity).\n\nThe
  number of investment opportunities that Australians might be missing out on as part
  of the remaining 99% is quite high.\n\nSharesight has users in over 90 countries
  around the world, but if we look solely at Australian users on paid plans to gain
  a better understanding of current trends, we can see a shift towards more internationally
  diverse portfolios over time. Looking at the period from 2010-2015, 12% of trades
  were placed directly on overseas exchanges, but since 2015 that figure jumped to
  20%.\n\n![Are Australian investors investing in Asia?](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5H8zqCUJP1etOtwtCexwFw/bc548305d381628783e6a8a756fd6500/Are_Australian_investors_investing_in_Asia__.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  The Asian growth story has a long way to go\n\nIt’s often been said that if the
  20th century was \"the American century\", the 21st century will be “the Asian century”.\n\nAccording
  to the IMF, the Asia-Pacific (which excludes Australia and New Zealand) currently
  represents 46% of global GDP. That includes:\n\n● China 19%\n\n● India 8%\n\n● Japan
  4%\n\n● Indonesia 3%\n\n● South Korea 2%\n\nThe IMF expects the Asia-Pacific region
  to increase its share of GDP to 50% by 2024. This economic advancement coupled with
  growing populations in the regions could mean for a raft of interesting opportunities
  that investors could benefit from within the area.\n\n## Investors may be missing
  out on profitable Asian opportunities\n\n### Direct investment in Asian Markets\n\nSharesight’s
  data shows that while Australian users tend to be more internationally diversified
  than the average investor, only 4% of Australian paid users invest directly in Asian
  markets, compared to 25% in US markets and 8% in European/UK markets.\n\nJust considering
  the possibilities of growth in the Asia-Pacific region, the opportunities that lie
  in wait for the canny investor are significant.\n\nIf we look just at the 4% who
  invest directly in Asia, we can see:\n\n● 84% own companies listed on the Hong Kong
  Stock Exchange\n\n● 19% own companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\n\n● 17%
  own companies listed on the Singapore Exchange\n\nIf you’re wondering why the Hong
  Kong Stock Exchange is so popular, it’s because investors tend to use it to access
  Chinese growth opportunities. For example, about a third of our users that invest
  in Asia are part-owners of Tencent. Ping An Insurance (8%) and ICBC (4%) rank second
  and third.\n\nConversely, some investors may be underweight in Japanese stocks,
  considering the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TYO) is the third-largest stock exchange in
  the world by market cap.\n\nIf Australians investing in Asia were distributing their
  money evenly, we’d expect more of it to flow to Japan.\n\nWe’ve already discussed
  one advantage of investing overseas. There are two other advantages.\n\n**Geographic
  diversification:** If Australia enters a recession but you’ve got investments in
  Asia and other parts of the world, this diversification will help shield your portfolio
  from potential losses.\n\n**Industry diversification:** By investing overseas, you
  can increase your exposure to growth opportunities in sectors that are underweight
  in the ASX. Take technology: tech stocks represent about 25% of the value of America's
  S&P 500, yet only about 2% of the value of the Australian All Ords. If all those
  Australian banks and miners encounter problems, but you’ve got investments in tech
  and other sectors, your portfolio might still grow.\n\n### Two reasons to invest
  indirectly in Asia\n\nSome might think this sounds great in theory, but that’s all
  it is, theoretical. After all, understanding overseas markets can be hard, given
  differences in language, culture, politics and economic conditions.\n\nThat’s one
  reason why some investors choose to invest directly in Australia but through ETFs
  overseas. Sharesight data shows that 14% of their Australian investors gain Asian
  exposure indirectly through ETFs, with the iShares Asia 50 ETF and iShares China
  Large-Cap ETFs being the most popular.\n\nA second reason why some investors choose
  to invest indirectly in Asia is that it can be hard to find an Australian broker
  that gives you access to Asia. Some Australian brokers offer only local trading;
  others do provide overseas access, but only to the US and UK markets. So, it’s important
  when researching brokers to look for worldwide market support if you might consider
  investing directly in these markets in the future.\n\nAnother option might be to
  invest in ASX listed companies that generate a lot of their revenue in Asia, for
  example, a2 Milk, which is owned by 8% of Australian paid users. However, if you
  take that option, your geographic and industry diversification will be limited,
  which is why investing directly in Asian shares or ETFs might be a better choice.\n\n##
