:title: Get weekly Sharesight20 ASX & NZX trading snapshots
:content: "Sharesight was founded over 10 years ago with a central mission. To make
  understanding the true performance of portfolios easy so investors can make [sound
  investment decisions](/blog/these-two-reasons-are-why-i-founded-sharesight/) that
  maximise their returns. The proof of the success in this mission is in the numbers,
  with [Sharesight premium plans averaging a 36% p.a. return](/blog/sharesight-in-numbers/).\n\nTo
  further empower Sharesight clients to make sound investment decisions we are unlocking
  the potential of the over $1.9 Billion of investments we currently track, creating
  the Sharesight20 trading snapshot.\n\nThe Sharesight20 trading snapshot is a weekly
  update of the top 20 shares traded by the Sharesight userbase on a particular market
  over the past 7 days. \n\nThese weekly snapshots provide valuable insights on trends
  and activity in these markets by the Sharesight community of (predominantly) DIY
  investors, making it easier than ever to make sound investment decisions.\n\n![Sharesight20

  Why the ASX and NZX?\n\nThe Sharesight investor community has a strong contingent
  of Australian and New Zealand based investors who love Sharesight’s [20 minute delayed
  ASX](/blog/introducing-20-minute-delayed-pricing-for-asx-holdings/) and [NZX pricing](/blog/introducing-20-minute-delayed-pricing-for-nzx-holdings/),
  so these markets were an obvious choice. We have therefore debuted Sharesight20
  trading snapshots for both the Australian Stock Exchange -- The Sharesight20ASX
  -- and the New Zealand Stock Exchange -- The Sharesight20NZX.\n\nSharesight [currently
  tracks 16 stock exchanges](/blog/snapshot-of-a-global-fintech/) around the world
  (and has [the ability to support approximately 200](/blog/global-stock-markets/)).
  If you’d like to see us release weekly Sharesight20 trading snapshots for other
  markets, join the Sharesight Community and let us know which ones!\n\n![Sharesight
