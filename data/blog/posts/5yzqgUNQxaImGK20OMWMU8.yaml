:title: 2017 Australian investor survey results
:content: "In our [2017 stock picking competition](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition/)
  survey we posed a series of questions to gauge Australian and Kiwi investor sentiment
  for the 2017 calendar year. Let’s find out how accurate those predictions proved
  to be.\n\n## Here are the results of our 2017 Australian investor survey\n\n###
  Where will the Aussie Dollar finish in 2017?\n\n![survey-2017 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3V2xcLQWTumqOaEOOqgcCK/5a58d51149bcc2b38224cb2b7c924ae7/survey-2017_1.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  majority got it right - [it finished at $0.78](http://www.xe.com/currencytables/?from=AUD&date=2017-12-31).\n\n###
  The next interest rate move from the RBA will be?\n\n![survey-2017 2](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1nMODJhBxmw8e46sMWKIuq/fbad628c38875552b107436275b5a751/survey-2017_2.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  RBA kept the official cash rate __on hold__ at the historically low setting of 1.5%
  [throughout 2017](https://www.rba.gov.au/monetary-policy/int-rate-decisions/2017/).\n\nWhen
  it came to home loan mortgage rates in Australia in 2017, many lenders were forced
  to [increase interest rates](http://digitalfinanceanalytics.com/blog/what-happened-to-home-loan-rates-a-year-on-from-apras-changes/)
  due to [APRA’s strengthened macroprudential controls](https://www.apra.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/apra-announces-further-measures-reinforce-sound-residential-mortgage)
  -- in particular rates charged to investors with interest-only loans, who saw an
  increase of 0.53% on average in the year to November before some late discounting
  by some banks at the end of the year.\n\n### What is your view on the outlook for
  Australian equities in 2017?\n\n![survey-2017 3](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4Ae5HwrATeK6EyYOiuC2Y4/2586a1dd19f78fc8ccb114f8ac017796/survey-2017_3.png?w=950)\n\nSurvey
  respondents were largely right, or not far off, with the majority expecting a neutral
  through bullish run in 2017. The ASX200 [finished up 7.1% in 2017](http://www.smh.com.au/business/asx-finishes-2017-with-7pc-yearly-gain-20171228-h0b720.html).\n\n###
  Large Caps vs. Small Caps - which part of the market will outperform in 2017?\n\n![survey-2017
  4](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7tmeGgZV3GMEWkSa6i0mW2/be0d349667fe17efdf5fcf90326e5e00/survey-2017_4.png?w=950)\n\nTaking
  data from two ASX index-tracking ETFs:\n\n1. ASX.SFY - tracking the S&P ASX 50 ‘large
  cap’ index\n2. ISO.ASX - tracking the ASX XSO ‘small cap’ index (comprised of companies
  not in the ASX100 that are in the ASX 300 index)\n\nThe performance for each in
  2017?\n\n1. Large caps saw a __1.28% loss__\n2. Small caps saw a __16.63% gain__\n\n######

  portfolio](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-your-portfolio-against-etfs/)?\n\n###
  Fairfax announces plans to spin out Domain via an IPO?\n\n![survey-2017 5](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/40HTMLpgF2EogMoygGYWwQ/71a1bd819bd02cb06db1a39efa05273c/survey-2017_5.png?w=950)\n\nNot
  only did Fairfax (ASX.FXJ) __announce__ plans to spin out the Domain real estate
  advertising business, they completed the [Fairfax-Domain split/demerger in November](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/fairfax-fxj-and-domain-dhg-demerger-details/)
  - creating Domain Holdings Australia (ASX.DHG) in the process.\n\nIf you hold Fairfax

  wind and rally in 2017?\n![survey-2017 6](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6bPJvYuNWwUgE6uEgeow0g/c7a99339adff35f5322803f3d04850e7/survey-2017_6.png?w=950)\n\nThe
  three China facing stocks in the question, A2Milk (ASX.A2M), Bellamy’s Australia
  (ASX.BAL) and Blackmores Limited (ASX.BKL) __all significantly outperformed the
  market__ in 2017.\n\n![China Facing Stocks](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/ONgXZJEpkkuQK0Suk6iAw/858170edfc2ca5de0372092bcfacc28f/China_Facing_Stocks.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Major banks and insurers outperform the ASX200 in 2017?\n\n![survey-2017 7](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3USCicVFfioQQquIgasyQm/c7a8335cb608e607223c8ae87ffc0f60/survey-2017_7.png?w=950)\n\nAustralia’s
  major banks and insurers make up a significant percentage of the ASX200 by value.
  Using an ETF that tracks the ASX 200 financial sector (ASX.QFN) we can [benchmark
  the performance](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/benchmarking-now-live-on-sharesight/)
  of that sector against the broader index.\n\nWhen looking at capital gains alone
  the ASX 200 __returned 7.05%__ (using iShares IOZ.ASX ETF as the benchmark), whereas
  financial stocks alone fell __0.58%__.\n\nWhen taking into account dividends (where
  financial shares saw a higher percentage return) in addition to the capital gain
  we see:\n\n- ASX 200 -- 12.45% total return\n- ASX.QFN (finance index) -- 5.95%
  total return\n\n![Finance Sector ASX performance 2017](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3OdKNZo7WoysaoMaQG06My/9a84541fab7d2a3ff76cb5d8241e1476/Finance_Sector_ASX_performance_2017.png?w=950)\n\n###
  Australian property (finally) corrects – average capital city house prices down
  by 5%?\n\n![survey-2017 9](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6LxGBsdeA8qAKKUwk0I4sY/86395e7080bbf09478715607d8985469/survey-2017_9.png?w=950)\n\nWe
  saw slightly more bears than bulls on Australian property in 2017. Despite a [significant
  cooling of the rapid growth](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-20/housing-market-shows-signs-of-cooling/8634598)
  in property prices of previous years, Australia prices across Australia’s largest
  5 capital cities __increased by 4.29%__ according to [data to Corelogic](https://www.corelogic.com.au/research/monthly-indices).\n\n##
  How did respondents fare in 2017?\n\nOverall more respondents correctly predicted
  the outcomes for 2017 for our survey questions, a solid case for the ‘[wisdom of
  the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)’! \n\nTell us about
  your predictions for financial markets in 2018 in the [Sharesight community forum](https://community.sharesight.com)
  or tweet [@Sharesight](https://twitter.com/Sharesight) with your top tips and predictions
  for the next year -- we’d love to hear them.\n\n### All articles in this series\n-
