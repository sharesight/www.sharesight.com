:title: 2018 Sharesight stock picking competition
:content: "Today we are launching the new and improved [Sharesight stock picking competition
  for 2018](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)!
  \nThis year’s competition includes a number of differences to 2017’s that we hope
  will make it more exciting for everyone involved. But first, let’s recap the 2017
  stock picking competition before we dive into the changes for 2018.\n\n## 2017 Sharesight
  & Livewire stock picking competition\n\n[Back in December 2016](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition/)
  we asked Sharesight’s Australian and New Zealand based clients to pick __one stock
  listed on the ASX__ to help Sharesight compete against our friends over at [Livewire](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/livewire/)
  (who also asked their readers for stock picks). We created Sharesight portfolios
  consisting of the top 5 (most popular) stocks picked by Sharesight clients and Livewire
  readers respectively, as well as a portfolio of the top 5 stocks picked by a group
  of Australia’s top fund managers. \n\n### 2017 stock competition result?\n\nBy the
  end of 2017 the fund manager portfolio as well as Livewire readers’ portfolios had
  significantly outperformed Sharesight’s community portfolio. Why? The Sharesight
  portfolio unfortunately included one of the worst performing shares included in
  the ASX 200 in 2017. (RFG.ASX) Retail Food Group generated a [-58.28% total return
  (loss) for the year](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/2017-stock-picking-competition--final-results/)
  -- wiping out almost all of the gains made in other parts of the portfolio.\n\n##
  2018 Sharesight stock picking competition details\n\nLast November (via our [blog](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition--details/)
  and email newsletter) we asked you to:\n\n> Pick your #1 performing stock of 2018
  for one of the following markets\n\n- Australia (ASX)\n- New Zealand (NZX)\n- Canada
  (TSE or CNSX)\n- United Kingdom (LSE)\n- USA (NYSE or NASDAQ)\n\nWe collated your
  responses (discarding invalid picks/typos/duplicates) and have created a Sharesight
  portfolio with a holding of each share picked, with the following rules:\n\n- The
  2018 Sharesight Stock Picking Competition portfolio was created with a tax residency
  in Australia (with the performance of shares in markets outside Australia subject
  to currency effects) \n- We “invested” $10,000 in each holding, but did not include
  brokerage for matters of convenience here. (Sharesight factors the impact of fees
  when [calculating portfolio performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_calculation_method/),
  as [reducing portfolio fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092815/how-optimize-your-portfolio-and-reduce-fees.asp)
  can improve returns)\n- All dividends are/will be included in the total performance
  calculation, and are reinvested. \n- Performance figures are total return (versus
  annualised) as none of the portfolio positions has been held for longer than one
  year.\n- The winner will be the person(s) who picked the top performing stock over
  the period January 1st through to December 31st 2018.\n\n## Following the performance
  of your stock pick is easy\n\n![featured sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2c0QkcckTOG6ogCOoSG0OM/4bfa658c0ff385d657680e730f455704/featured_sharesight-2018-stock-picking-competition-01.jpg?w=950)\n\nWe’ve
  made the [2018 Sharesight stock picking competition portfolio public for anyone
  to view](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/),
  removing the need to be logged-in to Sharesight to follow your stock’s performance
  against all other entries throughout the competition.\n\nEven if you don’t have
  a stock pick, this is an excellent way to follow the Sharesight competition. Bookmark
  the [2018 Sharesight stock picking competition public portfolio](https://public.sharesight.com/portfolios/2018-sharesight-stock-picking-competition/)
  to check back at any time.\n\n## Are there prizes for the winner(s)?\n\nYES! \n\nThe
  winner (or winners if multiple entries picked the same stock) will receive the glory
  of being the 2018 Sharesight stock picking competition champion!\n\nThey’ll also
  receive an [Amazon Echo (2nd Generation)](https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-echo-speaker-with-wifi-alexa-dark-charcoal/dp/B06XCM9LJ4)
  so they can quickly find out their Sharesight portfolio performance simply by asking
  Alexa -- thanks to the new [Sharesight Alexa skill](https://www.amazon.com/Russell-Dear-Sharesight/dp/B078P69Z3L/)
  (more details to be announced shortly)! \n\nGood luck and happy investing in 2018!\n\n(PS:
  Entries to the competition have unfortunately closed. Follow the progress this year
  and start thinking about your 2019 picks.)\n\n### All articles in this series\n\n-
