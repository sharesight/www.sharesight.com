:title: What is an Australian investment bond?
:url_slug: what-is-an-australian-investment-bond
:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only
  and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice
  and should not be relied upon as such. Please check with your adviser or accountant
  to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nAn investment bond is [similar
  to a managed fund](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/complex-investments/investment-and-insurance-bonds)
  -- but is typically sold through insurance and mutual companies (like AMP, Australian
  Unity, GenLife, etc). Investment bonds can be a tax-effective way to save for something
  big over the long term -- like your children’s or grandchildren's education, because
  earnings on the investment [are tax free](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/complex-investments/investment-and-insurance-bonds)
  and do not need to be included in assessable income when held for more than 10 years.\n\n![Australian
  investment bond](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/7IcL9q9LiSk491vNLFVye3/ad0f36c41b0990cd94cdb7b4e6919e4e/Australian_investment_bond.jpg?w=950)\n\nInvestment
  bonds are different to corporate or government bonds, which represent a loan from
  an investor to a borrower (such as a corporation or government entity) and will
  receive a regular payment at a fixed interest rate. \n\nInvestment bonds, like managed
  funds, offer investments in a range of underlying assets:\n\n* Australian shares\n\n*
  International shares\n\n* Property\n\n* Cash\n\n* Fixed interest\n\n* Infrastructure\n\n*
  Diversified funds\n\nInvestment bonds are a type of investment-savings plan, and
  because earnings are taxed within the bond at 30%, they’re [considered ‘tax-paid’
  investments](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/complex-investments/investment-and-insurance-bonds)
  at the company tax rate of 30% -- making them attractive to investors on higher
  marginal tax rates.\n\n## Investment bonds 10 year rule\n\nIn order to take advantage
  of the income [tax exemption](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/complex-investments/investment-and-insurance-bonds)
  for withdrawal or sale of the units in the investment bond, you must keep the contributions
  invested for at least 10 years. If you decide to withdraw any amount before the
  10 year period, [either some or all of the income may be assessable](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/complex-investments/investment-and-insurance-bonds),
  subject to a 30% offset for tax already paid on earnings by the company.\n\n## Investment
  bonds 125% rule\n\nOne of the major benefits of investment bonds is that you can
  ‘top up’ the money invested in the bond on a yearly basis (investing a maximum of
  125% more than each previous year) and still pay no capital gains on these subsequent
  contributions when the capital gains tax exception applies to the initial investment.\n\nInvestors
  need to be mindful however, because the 10 year capital gains tax exemption period
  resets whenever contributions are paused for more than a year and then followed
  by further contributions, or where contributions exceed 125% of the previous year’s
  investment.\n\nThe table below illustrates a case where an investor is able to contribute
  up to $89,407 by year 10 by starting at $12,000/year or $1000 per month.\n\n<table>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <td>Year</td>\n    <td>Contribution amount</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n
  \   <td>$12,000</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>$15,000</td>\n  </tr>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>$18,750</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>4</td>\n
  \   <td>$23,438</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>$29,297</td>\n  </tr>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>$36,621</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>7</td>\n
  \   <td>$45,776</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>$57,220</td>\n  </tr>\n
  \ <tr>\n    <td>9</td>\n    <td>$71,526</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>10</td>\n
  \   <td>$89,407</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n## Investment bonds are for the long
  term\n\nThe main points to keep in mind when considering an  investment bond are:\n\n*
  It’s for the long term\n\n* It can be tax effective\n\n* It’s most suited to people
  on a marginal tax rate higher than 30%\n\n* It’s can be used  to save for your children’s
  or grandchildren’s education\n\n* It’s also a tool for estate planning\n\n* It has
  a beneficiary eg., children or grandchildren. In the unfortunate event of the investment
  holder passing away, the money goes to the nominee tax-free\n\n* It attracts management
  fees\n\n## How do I track investment bond performance?\n\nLike many vehicles in
  the investment world and like many superannuation funds, when you login to your
  investment bond provider’s online portal, you can see the amounts contributed into
  the underlying instruments.\n\nFor example, a transaction statement from Australian
  Unity Lifeplan investment bond looks like this:\n\n![Track investment bond performance](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1y1TXuM52kIlw5wlz5gVVc/25329433e23e4783db75e7b9f43a95f2/Track_investment_bond_performance.png?w=950)\n\nI
  can log in and see pages of these contributions into the investment bond. But I
  don’t get to see how the investment bonds are actually performing, despite, the
  underlying instruments being unitised funds.\n\n## Using Sharesight to track performance
  of investment bonds\n\nIt’s easy to search for the underlying unitised fund within
  investment bonds like this by manually searching for the [fund code in Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/managed-funds-live-on-sharesight/).\n\n![Track
  investment bonds in sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6114zdnHnpxLyHrvKq9V6J/a588741236c24eb582221ef2c9b28287/Track_investment_bonds_in_sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nPersonally,
  I then use the \"[Custom Group](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-custom-groups/)\"
  feature to group these unitised investments into a single group to identify the
  investment bond instrument. Below is a screenshot from the Overview page of Sharesight
  where I have set it up as a Custom Group.\n\n![Custom Groups Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/yJNYW9PnPttPEg9p8rFwv/62de3c12c96d52236640327682785e25/Custom_Groups_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nAlternatively,
  because of the preferred tax treatment of these bonds, you could set up a distinct
  Sharesight portfolio to hold these, to separate out the impact of capital gains
  in these from the rest of your investments.\n\n## Track your investment bonds today\n\nIt’s
