:title: Australian ETF distribution components now available for FY19/20
:content: "Sharesight now has updated ETF distribution component information for the
  FY19/20 Australian tax year for all [iShares (BlackRock)](https://www.blackrock.com/au/individual/ishares),
  [Russell Investments](https://russellinvestments.com/au/solutions/exchange-traded-funds/overview),
  [ETF Securities](https://www.etfsecurities.com.au/) and [Vanguard](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/productType=etf)
  ETFs from [Computershare](https://www.sharesight.com/au/partners/computershare/)
  as well as updated distribution for [Betashares](https://www.betashares.com.au/)
  and VanEck ETFs. \n\nSharesight has also manually loaded data for State Street's
  STW & DJRE.\n\nThis means that for the majority of ETFs in Australia, Sharesight
  users will not need to manually update their ETF distribution components from their
  AMMA statement using [Sharesight’s pro-rata form](https://help.sharesight.com/au/taxable_income/#1)
  to add this information to their portfolio.\n\n![ETF distribution components](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4w60ie24iKuqVbSjm5uOtn/4cc6932b2d972c5cf7b8c6131d58f252/ETF_distribution_components.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What are ETF distribution components?\n\n[ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)
  are a type of unitised investment fund that can be bought and sold on stock exchanges.
  These funds pay distributions to shareholders throughout the financial year for
  any income earned by the fund. \n\nIn Australia, ETFs are structured as [Attribution
  Managed Investment Trusts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/),
  which impact how the income earned (dividends, realised capital gains, interest,
  etc) is split across different categories for tax reporting purposes.\n\nThe distributions
  paid by ETFs structured as AMITs are composed of many different tax components that
  can only be provided by the ETF fund manager once the tax year is over and the fund
  knows the detail of all the income earned by the investments within the ETF. \n\n![AMITCostBasedecreaseexample](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/bKPqGydoJyYmCkEcESOWm/bdd4e5beaa00db9708071d65159a5eb2/AMITCostBasedecreaseexample.png?w=950)\n\n<small>Example
  AMMA tax statement components and their corresponding fields in Sharesight</small>\n\n##
  Sharesight’s ETF distribution data\n\nSharesight receives estimates of the gross
  distribution values from the [ASX when they are announced](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/asx/),
  however [AMIT components](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  are only finalised when fund managers know the breakdown of income earned by the
  trusts, and then they make these values available to unit holders by issuing year-end
  [AMMA tax statements](https://help.sharesight.com/au/au-amit-tax-components/). \n\nThis
  means that the distribution values Sharesight receives from the ASX throughout the
  year *do not contain* AMIT component breakdowns. Sharesight has worked directly
  with the registries and fund managers involved to collect raw data for the majority
  of these AMIT trusts, which we then use to calculate the component values for individual
  ETF holdings. \n\nFor ETFs where Sharesight has data from Computershare or Betashares,
  users will be able to accept these values if they have not yet confirmed the distribution
  payment. Where users have already confirmed the payment or used the pro-rata form
  and want to return to the original values, clicking ‘reset this payout’ when editing
  the distribution will revert the data to the updated values we’ve received.\n\nYou
  can see how this process works in Sharesight by viewing the video below on how to
  confirm the ETF distribution components in Sharesight before running the Taxable
  Income Report to ensure the values match your AMMA statement. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/em-2X8eOIxI\"

  content: https://www.youtube.com/embed/em-2X8eOIxI</a>\n\n**Note:** Because each
  ETF fund manager uses slightly different calculations to determine unit holders’
  AMMA tax statement values, we highly recommend double-checking the values in Sharesight
  against your AMMA statement, as while we expect these to be correct, it’s *possible*
  a particular ETF/manager uses a different calculation to Sharesight. \n\n######
  If you find values that don’t line up with your AMMA statement - please reach out
  via our help chat widget or email so we can ensure these are correct.\n\n## Sharesight
