:title: Say yes to investment diversity Australia
:content: "## Australian investment diversity, a problem.\n\nYou’ve heard it plenty
  of times, Australia’s share market represents less than 2% of the world’s share
  market capitalisation. Yet according to data from the Financial Services Council
  of Australia<sup>[1]</sup>, just 0.6 per cent of self-managed super assets are invested
  in overseas shares, compared to 26.7 per cent of industry super funds, causing them
  to be over-exposed to the Australian stock market and property.\n\nAccording to
  the 2017 Australian Investor report by Deloitte<sup>[2]</sup> commissioned by the
  ASX, 75% of Australian investors hold only domestic equities and only 11% have exposure
  to international shares (which includes indirect ownership through local ETFs and
  managed funds). This report gave no clear number on the amount of investors that
  have ***direct exposure*** to overseas exchanges. Taking an educated punt, my guess
  is that less than 3% of investors have direct holdings on offshore exchanges. We’re
  putting all our eggs in a small basket that doesn’t represent the world we live
  in.\n\nThis means that the majority of Australian investors are limiting how and
  where their money can work for them. Not only are we limiting the opportunity to
  grow our wealth, but we’re running unnecessary risks within our portfolio.\n\n##
  Do not fear, change is near\nRecently, issues regarding the composition of Australian
  portfolios have been simmering in the media. Well known investment writers have
  joined the choir and we’ve seen the growth of fund managers (Magellan and Platinum
  in particular) who focused on giving Australians broad access to global markets.\n\n![featured

  for self-directed investors who manage their money with less cost, more transparency
  and specific exposure (i.e. not broad AUD based ETFs or funds), investing overseas
  has historically been complex and costly. The ability of Australian investors to
  diversify globally has been hindered by major barriers to entry, including slow
  execution, paper based applications, long processing times and tax reporting burdens
  (for example, the infamous W8-BEN forms).\n \n**Luckily, this is no longer the case.**
  It’s now actually cheaper and simpler to get invested in the US markets than it
  is to trade ASX listed stocks. Fact.\n\nWhy have I chose the US? Let’s put it this
  way: of all the advisors and platforms I’ve spoken to, when a client invests overseas,
  85-90% of all direct international exposure is going to the USA. Having a fully
  international offering is an additional expense and the offering diminishes significantly
  outside of the US, as the utility drops sharply. That’s why at [Stake](https://stake.com.au/?utm_source=sharesight),
  we’ve focused on the one thing Australian investors really need: simple and affordable
  access to the US share markets.\n\n> While Australia is heavily weighted towards
  the banks, miners and retail stores, the US market makes up 36% of the world’s stock
  market capitalisation and has a stronger market bias towards tech, health, financials
  and online retail.\"\n\nFor those who want a bit more of a reason to jump on the
  international band-wagon, I’ve set out four additional reasons why investors should
  entertain getting US exposure. \n\n### 1. Returns\n\nStaying local and not looking
  global has really hurt Australian investors, and we’ve seen the outcome of this
  with below average returns for our index when compared to the markets such as the
  US.\n\nOver the past five years, the annual returns in the US stock market (as provided
  by MSCI<sup>[3]</sup>) stand at an annual return of +12.27%, compared to Australia,
  which returned -0.20%. That’s an awesome loss of 0.2% yearly. The reasons for this
  are varied, but one major factor is America's weighting towards global tech companies
  versus Australia being overweight towards banks, mines and large corporates.\n\nWe’re
  surrounded by global companies changing the Australian landscape, from Netflix killing
  the DVD, to Amazon threatening our supermarkets and retailers. Yet many investors
  are still pushed to invest on the ASX, the very companies threatened by these global
  powerhouses. Shouldn’t Australians be able to back the right horse?\n \n### 2. Opportunity
  to diversify\n\nThe opportunity to truly diversify your portfolio is limited locally.
  Access to a more diverse offering of companies, sectors and themes means you can
  choose from a broader and more pertinent range of opportunities. Why would you limit
  yourself? While Australia is heavily weighted towards the banks, miners and retail
  stores, the US market makes up 36% of the world’s stock market capitalisation and
  has a stronger market bias towards tech, health, financials and online retail.\n\nNot
  only can you invest in the world’s largest companies including Amazon, Apple, Google
  and Microsoft, you could also be trading in international giants, like Alibaba,
  Atlassian, Lululemon and Ferrari, all of whom are listed on the US market. Not to
  mention the new age stocks like Shopify, Square and nVidia which are all up over
  100% in the past 12 months.\n\n![market-cap](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/43mTuj1Xj2qIyIIkSIyMsU/e86a10e95209c662b065f0d072dd8741/market-cap.png?w=950)\n\nTo
  add some icing to the opportunity cake, there are also approximately 2000 Exchange
  Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the US share market, which is nearly as many stocks
  as there are listed on the ASX (2400). The ASX has around 100 ETPS (Exchange-traded
  products).<sup>[4]</sup>\n\nThese US based ETFs gives you exposure to various asset
  classes, ideas and themes, so you can find something that works with any investment
  hypothesis. Whether it's getting exposure to the short side of the market more simply
  than ever before, trading oil or soft commodities, or simply getting your money
  into government bonds, you’ll find something that fits on the US share markets.\n\n###
  3. It’s cheaper to trade globally than locally\n\nLook at it this way, would you
  chose a holiday where you had to drive 15 hours to stay in a motel in a two horse
  town when for way less money, you could fly overseas (first class) to a 5 star resort?
  Probably not. However, that’s what many Australians are doing when it comes to investing.\n
  \nInvesting overseas has for too long been falsely perceived as more expensive than
  investing locally. Execution costs in the USA are close to zero due to its market
  structure. Remember, some brokers and platforms still charge up to 1% to trade internationally
  -- but that is changing. If it isn’t, it might be time to look at changing your
  broker!\n \nThe FX cost of converting your cash into USD to trade is also similarly
  competitive, thanks to the services of OFX, Transferwise and World First.\n \nOn
  the flipside, Aussie brokers charge up to $29.99 for a one off trade on the ASX
  to invest in various shares, including Coles, Woolies, ANZ, NAB and BHP. Through
  newer tech forward platforms in Australia, you can trade or invest in the likes
  of Amazon, Apple, Google, Nike and Tesla for close to nothing. At Stake, our brokerage
  to trade is zero ([see how we do it](https://stake.com.au/blog-post/how-can-stakes-brokerage-be-0-20170717/?utm_source=sharesight))
  as we just pass on what it really costs to execute in the US to Aussie investors.\n\n###
  4. Next generation growth\n\nThe world is moving at the speed of light. Literally.
  As technology impacts our lives more and more, the speed at which it develops is
  also growing exponentially. There is a next generation of companies on the way that
  will have similar impacts as Google, Amazon and Tesla (think Square, nVidia and
  Shopify), but they’re not going to list on the Australian market.\n\nOne of Australia’s
  largest companies, Atlassian, chose to list in the USA rather than here at home.
  A similar pattern can be seen in Asia, with the likes of Alibaba, Baidu and Weibo
  looking to list abroad to not only grow their capital base, but also their global
  footprint. We’ll see more of this happening in coming years, as emerging companies
  from all over the world choose to list on the the US sharemarket over their home
  country.\n\n## So what’s next?\nDeep down, self-directed investors know that they
  should be investing where the costs are lower and the opportunity greater. Limiting
  your potential for growth is a cardinal investment sin. 98% of investment opportunities
  live outside of Australia and accessing them has become far more simple and affordable
  than ever before. Technology forward platforms, like Stake, offer a place for self-directed
  investors to diversify their holdings into a world of opportunity.\n\n### About
