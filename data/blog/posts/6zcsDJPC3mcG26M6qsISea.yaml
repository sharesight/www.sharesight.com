  Earlier this year we debuted the [Sharesight20 weekly trading snapshots](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/get-weekly-sharesight20-asx-nzx-trading-snapshots/), a weekly update of the top 20 shares traded by the Sharesight userbase on the ASX ([#Sharesight20ASX](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharesight20asx)) and the NZX ([#Sharesight20NZX](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharesight20nzx)) over the previous 7 days.

  Today is the third installment of the Sharesight20 monthly trading snapshot ([click here for last month’s Sharesight20](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight20-november-top-20-trades-on-asx-nzx/)), where we look at the top 20 trades on both the ASX and NZX markets among the Sharesight userbase during the current month and dig a little deeper into the news behind these movements.
