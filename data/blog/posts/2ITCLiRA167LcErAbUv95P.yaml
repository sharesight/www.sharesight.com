:title: The 20 shares most traded by SMSFs in 2018
:content: "SMSFs make up roughly 35% of the portfolios tracked in Sharesight by Australian
  investors. Looking at this data, we’re able to generate insights into the investment
  trends of trustees building their [self-managed superannuation funds](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/).
  \n\nLet’s take a look at the 20 most traded shares within those SMSF portfolios,
  and how they performed in 2018. \n\n![SMSF Top20 trades 2018](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3d00UqTnmJzZUwEUAgQ6pb/dc65bd13cfee51c72611e391bd854934/SMSF_Top20_trades_2018.png?w=950)\n\nBased
  on the top 20 most traded shares by SMSFs, we constructed to see the relative performance
  of these instruments through the lenses of capital gains and dividends on Sharesight.
  The purpose of building such a portfolio was to demonstrate the relative performance
  of the shares most traded by SMSFs that use Sharesight. \n\nSome assumptions in
  the calculation of returns below: \n\n* All shares were \"purchased\" on 1 Jan 2018.\n\n*
  A brokerage fee of $15 was allocated to every buy transaction.\n\n* The cost base
  of shares was as close to $1,000 as possible. Eg., the CSL (ASX.CSL) share price
  on 1 Jan 2018 was $141.30. The closest amount to $1,000 was 7 shares, which along
  with a $15 brokerage fee, brought the total cost base to $1004.10. \n\n* The Wesfarmers
  (ASX.WES) cost base was adjusted by the amount of the new Coles group shares cost
  base to reflect the impact of the [Wesfarmers and Coles demerger](https://help.sharesight.com/au/wesfarmers-and-coles-demerger/).\n\n##

  Afterpay Touch (ASX.APT) -- The \"buy now, pay later\" company that’s always in
  the news has also made frequent appearances in the [Sharesight20ASX](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharesight20asx)
  in 2018. This stock has had a stellar 104.64% growth in capital over 2018.\n\n2.
  a2 Milk Company (ASX.A2M) -- Another company that made headlines through 2018, the
  a2 Milk Company generated 38% growth in capital.\n\n3. CSL Ltd (ASX.CSL) -- A biotech
  company involved in the production of insulin and penicillin, and vaccines against
  influenza, polio and other infectious diseases. While R&D takes place in Australia,
  it’s a major exporter with most of its revenues coming from the Northern hemisphere.
  CSL made headline news when it became the first ASX-listed share to cross $200 in
  August 2018. It generated a capital gain of 16%.\n\n## Top 3 shares in terms of
  dividend yields\n\n1. National Australia Bank (ASX.NAB) -- While the share price
  didn’t perform well, NAB generated the highest dividend yield of 9.4%.\n\n2. Telstra
  (ASX.TLS) -- Another underperformer in terms of share price, Telstra provided a
  8.53% dividend yield in 2018.\n\n3. Westpac (ASX.WBC) -- As with all the other major
  banks, Westpac had a rough year as the *Royal Commission into Misconduct in the
  Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry* unravelled in 2018. Despite
  this, shareholders were still rewarded with a 8.44% dividend yield.\n\n## Diversification\n\nApple
  (NASDAQ.AAPL) was the only international share in the top 20 most traded among these
  SMSFs. As shown in the Sharesight [Performance Report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  a major component of the return came from currency changes in AUD relative to the
  USD.\n\n\n### Role of ETFs in diversification\n\nASX-listed ETFs VGS and VAS were
  among the top 20 traded ASX shares among these SMSFs in 2018. [According to the
  Vanguard website](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8212/?overview),
  ASX.VGS ETF provides exposure to many of the world’s largest companies listed in
  major developed countries. It offers low-cost access to a broadly diversified range
  of securities that allows investors to participate in the long-term growth potential
  of international economies outside Australia.\n\nLocally, ASX.VAS, the Vanguard
  Australian Shares Index ETF, seeks to track the return of the S&P/ASX 300 Index
  before taking into account fees, expenses and tax.\n\n## What’s your SMSF investment
  strategy?\n\nAs can be seen from the top 20 traded shares by SMSFs using Sharesight
  in 2018, SMSF trustees favour investments that generate high income yield via dividends.
  However, ETFs such as ASX.VGS and ASX.VAS have found their way into the top 20 most
  traded shares.\n\nSMSF Trustees are required to [document the investment strategy
  of their SMSF](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/investing/your-investment-strategy/)
  each year. Typically, this is a pretty bland and generic document that is prepared
  by an accountant and simply highlights the [asset allocation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/)
  (e.g. the split between equities, fixed interest, international shares).\n\nSharesight’s
  [Custom Groups](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/announcing-custom-groups/) feature
  allows you to organise your holdings according to this asset allocation and investment
  strategy, easing your SMSF admin burden and providing valuable insights throughout
  the year.\n\nWith over [$6.1B USD worth of investments actively tracked](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-now-tracks-over-1-million-investments/)
  by investors with Sharesight, it’s time you [sign up for an account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
