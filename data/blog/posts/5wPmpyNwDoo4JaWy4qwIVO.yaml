:content: "Using Sharesight, investors can automatically track the price and performance
  of stocks and ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with price and performance
  updates on a [15 minute delayed basis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/).
  This is in addition to Sharesight's support for other US markets including the [Nasdaq](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-stocks-on-the-nasdaq-with-sharesight/),
  [NYSE American (AMEX)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-adds-17000-otc-equities-and-nyse-american-market/),
  NYSE ARCA and [BATS Exchange (BATS)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-bats-markets-bzx-listed-stocks-with-sharesight/),
  plus more than [40 other leading global exchanges](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-stock-exchanges-and-managed-funds/).
  This gives investors access to Sharesight’s award-winning performance, [dividend
  tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/) and tax reporting features,
  while allowing them to track *all of their investments in one place.*\n\n![200k

  What is the New York Stock Exchange? \n\nFounded in the US in 1792, the [New York
  Stock Exchange](https://www.nyse.com/index) (NYSE) is the world’s largest stock
  market by market capitalisation. The exchange lists a wide variety of US and international
  stocks, ranging from blue chips to new growth stocks.\n\n## Why should investors
  track their NYSE stocks with Sharesight?\n\nInvestors tracking their NYSE stocks
  with Sharesight can easily monitor the [price and performance of their investments](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  across multiple asset classes and brokers – benefiting from Sharesight's [15 minute
  delayed pricing](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/sharesight-intraday-pricing-us-uk-stocks/)
  for the NYSE – or take advantage of Sharesight's advanced performance and tax reporting
  features built for self-directed investors. Most importantly, Sharesight’s [annualised
  performance calculation methodology](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-sharesight-calculates-your-investment-performance/)
  gives investors a clear picture of their portfolio’s performance by taking into
  consideration the impact of brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/),
  foreign exchange rates and capital gains when calculating returns. \n\n### Track
  dividends from NYSE stocks\n\nUnlike other portfolio trackers, Sharesight automatically
  tracks dividend and distribution income, which is included when calculating your
  portfolio’s returns. As can be seen in the screenshot below, dividends can have
  a real impact on your returns, which is why your portfolio tracking solution needs
  to consider more than just capital gains when calculating your performance. \n\n![image

  Powerful performance reports designed for investors\n\nSharesight has a range of
  powerful reports for investors who want a more detailed breakdown of their portfolio’s
  performance, such as [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/), [Contribution
  Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/)
  and [Future Income](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/) (upcoming dividends).
  The screenshot below, for example, shows the Contribution Analysis Report being
  used to see the relative ‘weight’ of each market in a portfolio. This could be useful
  for investors looking to compare the performance of their NYSE stocks with the rest
  of their portfolio, for instance. \n\n![image 2 NYSE](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/pYW9CZGU64FBqt8Wscpbr/4f441cb905a9057838c00d1fc0a65eed/image_2_NYSE.png?w=950)\n\n##
