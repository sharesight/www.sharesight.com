:title: What does the economic future hold for NZ? (part 2)
:url_slug: what-does-the-economic-future-hold-for-nz-have-the-doomsayers-got-it-wrong-part-2
:content: "For those of us with an interest in the share market this is an issue of
  some importance. We all know that when the markets take a tumble they will rise
  again, but it would be great to get a handle on how long it will be before we see
  an upturn and how strong that upturn will be.\n\nSo what does the economic future
  hold for NZ? Here's my take on the situation. Caveat: I might change my mind next
  week!\n\nThere is no doubt that there is going to be a major reorganisation of credit
  globally. In my last blog I said that the consequences of such a massive change
  that will embroil the Government (and quasi-government organisations) so extensively
  in the financial markets, are impossible to predict. I hold to this, but I also
  think that while this process is occurring, the productive sector will quickly get
  back to something approaching normalcy. In other words the players will soon stop
  obsessing over the score and concentrate on the game.\n\nClearly NZ will not escape
  the impact of the credit crisis (particularly as our household debt is so high)
  or the recession that is likely to hit most of our trading partners. But there are
  good reasons to believe we will be less severely affected than most.&nbsp;Unlike
  many countries we have not had major bank collapses, our financial system has not
  been hijacked by out-of-control derivatives trading and the Reserve bank has more
  latitude than its overseas counterparts to provide further stimulus via interest
  rate cuts if necessary.\n\nAll this suggests to me that the NZ economy is likely
  to be less severely affected than most (in marked contrast to the situation that
  prevailed after the 1987 share market crash). Reduced demand as a result of the
  looming world-wide recession should keep the lid on oil prices for some time and
  further aid NZ's recovery. In addition, renewable energy and sustainable food production
  are likely to become watch-words and NZ will be in the vanguard in both these vital
  areas. \n\nSo back to our share market. What might all this mean? I believe it will
  be good news. Our economy will recover more quickly than most and be less severely
  affected. This will enhance NZ's reputation as a sound place to invest and re-stimulate
  investment in our share market from both local, and more importantly, offshore investors.\n\nThis
  is not to say it will not be tough going in NZ for a few years but here's another
  bit of good news. I believe that the full impact of current downturn in the NZ economy
  is already fully reflected in the NZ share market and then some. Not convinced?
  Consider this quote:\n\n> I've given up looking at my own share price because it
  doesn't make any sense to real life at all. I mean if I looked at it I'd think there
  was something gravely wrong with the company, which there is isn't. I mean it's
  bloody stupid.<br><cite><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/700189/Michael-Hill-still-determined-to-build-an-empire\">Michael
  Hill</a></cite>\n\nSo how long before an upturn and how strong will it be I don't
  know but I have certainly persuaded myself not to give up on the NZ share market.
