:content: "With support for [more than 170 brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)
  worldwide, Sharesight makes tracking your investment portfolio easy. Investors can
  automatically import historical and ongoing buy and sell trades into a Sharesight
  portfolio using the [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  sent by most brokers, which is a convenient way to keep your investment portfolio
  up-to-date.  \n\n[Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) is one of the
  many brokers from which you can automatically import trades directly into your Sharesight
  portfolio. This gives United States investors the opportunity to leverage Sharesight’s
  award-winning performance, [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/)
  and tax reporting features. \n\n## Who is Fidelity Investments?\n\n[Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/)
  is a US-based financial services firm that is currently one of the world’s largest
  asset managers. The company offers brokerage services with $0 commissions for US
  stocks and ETFs, access to digital-only investing, as well as a hybrid robo service
  with access to advisors. \n\n## Import your Fidelity Investments data to Sharesight\n\nSharesight
  allows you to import your historical and ongoing trades in US stocks and ETFs through
  the Trade Confirmation Emails feature, or you can choose to manually import your
  historical trades by uploading a spreadsheet file. Keep reading to learn more. \n\n##
  How to import historical trades through a spreadsheet \n\nOne simple way to import
  historical trades to Sharesight is by creating and formatting a [ spreadsheet file](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1)
  filled with trades from your trading account.\n\n![FidelityInvestments image 1 (1)](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3cBYJL7srszP3qqSXTbaWz/570e53a1215f36976bdc9ae9e3c05411/FidelityInvestments_image_1__1_.png?w=950)\n\nAs
  long as the file contains all the [required information](https://help.sharesight.com/import_bulk_trades/#1),
  you can upload it to Sharesight and quickly bulk import the trading data you wish
  to see in your portfolio. \n\n## Use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation Emails feature
  for ongoing trades\n\nIt’s easy for US investors to use Sharesight’s Trade Confirmation
  Emails feature to add ongoing trades from a Fidelity Investments account to a Sharesight
  portfolio. Read our [Trade Confirmation Emails help page](https://help.sharesight.com/contract_notes/)
  to get started, then forward your trade confirmations to your unique portfolio email
  address located under the Integrations tab in the Trade Confirmation Emails section.\n\n![FidelityInvestments

  This feature is designed primarily for ongoing trades, but it can also be used to
  fill in historical trades in your Sharesight portfolio. All you need to do is manually
  forward the Trade Confirmation Emails for the trades you wish to see in your portfolio,
  starting with the earliest trade you want included. \n\n## We need your help to
  add more US brokers!\n\nSharesight is always adding new brokers to its [list of
  supported brokers](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/transaction-fees-commissions/etfs).
  Help us add more US brokers – if your broker is not currently supported, let us
  know by leaving a message in the chat interface located at the bottom-right of Sharesight.
  All you will need to do is supply some sample buy and sell trade confirmations (email
  or PDF), the email the broker sends them from and the subject line of the emails.
  \n\nWe only require a few sample documents to support a new broker, so reach out
  today if you want to see yours added!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n* [Getting started
