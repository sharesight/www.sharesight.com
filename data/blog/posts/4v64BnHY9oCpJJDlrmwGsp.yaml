:content: "2020 has been an extraordinary year for markets and the ASX Australian
  Investor Study 2020 (AIS) has picked up on a number of interesting trends that are
  important for Australian investors to be aware of. \n\nRead below for the key takeaways
  from this year’s AIS, as well as the recording of Sharesight’s webinar with the
  ASX where they presented additional insights.  \n\n![ASX Australian Investor Study](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1oEoKQfsfz2uBLi3uuW2EE/da465b41e143011bb3dea644ac35efee/ASX_Australian_Investor_Study.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  What is the ASX Australian Investor Study?\n\nThe AIS is a comprehensive study of
  Australian investors the ASX has been conducting on a regular basis for over 30
  years. The study has a focus on ownership of investments, trading behaviours, risk
  profiles and attitudes of ordinary Australians investing outside their institutional
  superannuation. \n\nFor this year’s study the primary field survey for the study
  was conducted in January prior to the COVID market downturn, and was followed up
  with a pulse survey in May, to measure changes in investor attitudes and investing
  behaviour. \n\n## Retail investing is widespread in Australia\n\nAustralia remains
  one of the largest retail markets per capita worldwide, with 46% adult Australians
  invested in either a listed or unlisted capacity (9m) and of those that choose to
  invest, 74% hold listed investments. This willingness to invest illustrates that
  Australians believe in the efficiency and efficacy of listed markets as a source
  of investment returns. \n\n## Australian investors embrace equities \n\nAs with
  the previous study in 2017, the number one held investment is Australian equities,
  with 58% of investors holding this asset class. The rise of ETFs did not go unnoticed
  either, now being an equal second of the investments held on exchange with international
  shares (15%). This is consistent with the rise of a Next Generation of investors,
  with a strong preference to both Aussie equities (38%) and ETFs (20%). In November
  2010, there were only 38 ETFs on exchange and this number has grown to 217. Notwithstanding
  a difficult economic and market background, the FUM of the Australian ETF market
  has grown from $66bn at the start of 2020 to $71bn currently. \n\n## COVID shifted
  investor expectations\n\nAs previously mentioned, a pulse survey was conducted in
  May to observe covid19-induced shifts in investor behaviour. An obvious shift was
  noted in the risk appetite of Australians. The proportion of people wanting stable
  returns (down 7%) or moderate volatility (up 12%) saw the most obvious shifts, where
  the preference of guaranteed returns fell over 11%. The overall takeaway from the
  COVID market volatility was although people’s return expectations fell, it did not
  stop them from investing (median expectations fell from 8.4% p.a to 5% p.a). Reverting
  back to the initial principles of investing shows us that diversification lowers
  your overall portfolio risk for a given return. The research has shown that since
  the emergence of COVID, Australians have become more focused on diversification
  and risk management as well as sustainability of returns. The AIS also showed that
  a significant proportion of investors are focused on building a portfolio with long
  term goals in mind, rather than short-term trading ideas. \n\n## New investors are
  increasingly women\n\nThe increase in female investing is perhaps the most encouraging
  finding from the AIS, making up 45% of total new investors over the last 12 months.
  The research shows that the greatest fears women hold when it comes to investing
  outside of general market volatility are the fear of underperformance, fear of hidden
  fees, not knowing what investments to select, and money being tied up in investments.
  Overcoming these fears is often a case of investment psychology and education (using
  information resources, seeking professional and trustworthy advice). Another potential
  cause of female aversion to seeking financial advice may be due to the Hayne Royal
  Commission, where issues around sound financial advice were highlighted in the media.
  \n\n## Australian investors view financial advice positively\n\nAustralians have
  a positive attitude towards receiving financial advice, with over half of current
  investors willing to seek advice and 70% of those who have not yet invested. The
  general finding of the study is that Australians are open to receiving advice from
  some sort of financial professional, be it an adviser, accountant or wealth manager,
  but there are barriers to achieving this outcome. Of the investors surveyed, 25%
  claim they cannot find a suitable adviser. To help remedy this problem, ASX has
  launched a ‘Find An Adviser’ tool on the new ASX website, whereby users can search
  for registered financial advisers that are licensed by ASX brokers (also known as
  Trading Participants). \n\nAlmost 30% of Australians sought advice from their financial
  adviser over the last 12 months, but the most obvious trend uncovered by the AIS
  has been the uptake of micro-savings apps or online platforms such as ‘robo’ advice,
  with over 20% over respondents using this medium for investing over the last twelve
  months.\n\n## Watch Sharesight’s ASX Australian Investor Study 2020 webinar \n\nASX
