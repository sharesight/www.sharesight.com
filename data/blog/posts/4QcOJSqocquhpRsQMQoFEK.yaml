  Who is Direct Broking?\n\n[Direct Broking](https://www.directbroking.co.nz/directtrade/static/home.aspx)
  is a New Zealand-based online trading platform that was acquired by NZ broking firm
  [Jarden Securities](https://www.jarden.co.nz/) from ANZ Bank in 2018. Direct Broking
  gives investors access to a range of exchanges supported by Sharesight, including
  the NZX, ASX, NYSE, NASDAQ and LSE, with trading fees starting from $29. The platform
  also offers real-time research on listed companies in New Zealand, Australia and
  Hong Kong, as well as access to ANZ’s banking and wealth services. \n\n## Import
  your Direct Broking trades to Sharesight\n\nInvestors trading through Direct Broking
  can connect directly to Sharesight to automatically import *future trades* into
  their portfolio, while *historical trading data* can also be easily imported through
  Sharesight’s [file importer](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/)
  feature. Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## Connect your Direct Broking account to
