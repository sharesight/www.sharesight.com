:title: Track Livewire's most tipped stocks for 2020
:content: "We've partnered with Livewire again, to help you track their [top picks
  from fund managers](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/the-1-stock-picks-for-2020)
  as well as the top picks from Livewire readers for 2020.\n\n[Livewire will be sharing
  updates](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/) on the performance of the stocks in these
  portfolios on a quarterly basis. Plus we’ve made it easy to track all three Livewire
  portfolios in Sharesight.\n\n![featured livewire-sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3fTqVqjwqfi8pwkIjBGkFP/4400c03aa836dd73353f91c71b20b5a5/featured_livewire-sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Livewire’s most tipped stocks for 2020\n\n### How it works: \n\nWe’ve built three
  Sharesight portfolios for these picks (assuming a buy date of 1 Jan 2020) with $10,000
  of each stock pick ‘bought’ on New Year's Day inclusive of brokerage costs. All
  dividends are reinvested. As three of these stocks are US-based, you will be able
  to track the impact of currency movements on the total shareholder return of each
  stock pick.\n\nWe’ll keep track of the portfolios’ performance against S&P/ASX 200
  index tracking ETF STW.\n\n### Livewire fund manager stock picks for 2020\n\n![Fund

  Livewire readers stock picks for 2020\n\nLivewire ran their annual [Predictions
  and Top Picks survey](https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/10-most-tipped-big-caps-for-2020)
  that was extremely popular among their readers. We've built a portfolio of these
  stocks as well.\n\n![Livewire top stock picks 2020](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2N6QhcqT2iFCy8BJkSxrUi/4d1858653705dc75b5abff3d0005b73e/Livewire_top_stock_picks_2020.png?w=950)\n\n###
