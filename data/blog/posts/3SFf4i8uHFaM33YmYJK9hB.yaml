:title: How to track an investment property in Sharesight
:url_slug: how-to-track-an-investment-property-in-sharesight
:content: "As a multi-asset class investor, I like to track all my investments on
  the same basis. Before I started using Sharesight, and the money-weighted methodology,
  if someone asked me whether my investment property was a good investment, I would
  look at the performance purely in terms of capital gains and would’ve concluded
  it was \"doing okay\" as an investment.\n\nWith Sharesight you can do so much more,
  in this example we show how to get the full picture of your investments, by adding
  a property investment to your Sharesight portfolio.\n\n### This article covers:\n\n-

  How to record the purchase of an investment property in Sharesight\n\nTo get started
  you need to enter the purchase or the \"buy\" transaction for the property, for
  this I used the [custom investment feature](https://help.sharesight.com/unquoted-instruments/)
  in Sharesight.\n\n![Buy property Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3JAES0bKd7BrXBV6naIP1E/58b7fd2bbec7c1ca7c8296dfc089467f/Buy_property_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n*Note:
  In this example, I don’t take any debt used to purchase the property into consideration.
  Sharesight can’t handle negative balances and interest expenses that may be incurred
  in buying the property.*\n\nI use Sharesight as a tool for record keeping as well
  as tracking performance of my investments. So I upload copies of any document relevant
  to this transaction, such as stamp duty receipts, solicitor fees, buyers agent invoice,
  and property valuations. I also use the comments section to document my investment
  thesis.\n\n## How to track investment property rental income in Sharesight\n\nThis
  is an investment property that I also rent out, this rental income can be recorded
  for the property in Sharesight. Below is a statement screenshot with the rental
  income and expenses on that particular month. \n\n![Rental Investment property income
  Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6mxm0JZSJ1z2To0DVMMOyR/3ca14814ca0ec8b62a6f068911795c79/Rental_Investment_property_income_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nI
  record this rental income as a 'dividend' payment for the property holding in Sharesight.
  I also attach the rental income statement from the real estate agency to this dividend
  entry by uploading the statement against the 'dividend' income payment record.\n\n![Track
  rental income Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/WbEcdZbhHQRxUgk2vOYbE/ab9f7868ab4fc69779a3c75b8d50a859/Track_rental_income_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n###
  View all your rental income in Sharesight\n\nOnce entered, records of this rental
  income can be easily viewed in Sharesight and is included when running performance
  and tax reports on your investment portfolio. \n\n![Rental Income Track Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5CLcfLZO6A3ChRyZQAykY2/f54a483e999712d8ef37180725c9a5c7/Rental_Income_Track_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n##
  How to update your investment property valuation\n\nShould you perform an appraisal
  on your property and its market value changes, you can update the price to reflect
  your property’s current valuation in Sharesight. \n\n![Manage price](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/6rb93W0GVBtbkuhEl5O6Ml/02bfbb2a9ae21cab3d2d1ae2450296cf/Manage_price.jpg?w=950)\n\nTo
  do this, use the \"Manage prices\" button on the holding instrument detail section
  (screenshot above) then update the value to reflect the new valuation for the property
  - this will allow you to track the value of this property alongside the rest of
  your investment portfolio over time.\n\n![Property Valuation Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1GHrdk5Nc06ghwRXoLwHn6/dcce031cf54fdc43980977744b85f538/Property_Valuation_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Track how your property investments are performing within your portfolio\n\nI like
  setting up my portfolio to visualise my performance by asset class using my own
  [custom group](https://help.sharesight.com/custom-groups/) definitions. To access
  and define your own custom groups, see the screenshot below on where it is located
  in Sharesight.\n\n![Custom Groups in Sharesight](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2BGzVWOfV8QMoKmwxnuCNA/abaf986484d722457123e2b626a3c71d/Custom_Groups_in_Sharesight.png?w=950)\n\nOnce
  in your custom groups settings, you can define and categorise your investments by
  your own asset type groupings. For example, the groups In my own portfolio are shown
  below.\n\n![image 2020-12-08 143127](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/71S0zB1gXjy0aIftkIXVPO/8ecb83fd0833fac31a8769897fc4f515/image_2020-12-08_143127.png?w=950)\n\nOnce
  my custom groups are set, I can use these groupings to view performance broken down
  along these custom dimensions in Sharesight reports like the [performance report](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  [diversity report](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-to-track-your-asset-allocation-strategy-in-sharesight/)
  and [contribution analysis](https://help.sharesight.com/contribution-analysis-report/)
  to monitor and track the performance of my investments.\n\n## Track all your investments
