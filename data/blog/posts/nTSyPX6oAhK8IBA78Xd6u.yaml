:url_slug: supported-brokers-global
:content: "For investors who trade across multiple markets, currencies and brokers,
  keeping track of your investment performance can be a daunting task. With Sharesight’s
  portfolio tracker, however, users can automatically import their trading data from
  [over 200 brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/) worldwide – making
  it easier than ever for investors to track *all of their investments in one place*.
  An important part of this is our [Trade Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature, which is a convenient way for investors to automatically sync historical
  and ongoing trades to their portfolio. To learn more about some of the leading global
  brokers Sharesight supports, and how Sharesight makes it easy for investors to import
  their trades, keep reading. \n\n![Track trades 200 global brokers](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3rbsgUUlpxdcOgRnRgaZG/a1b81fe2ee89285e8fb70ba7d92e7179/Track_trades_200_global_brokers.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Global brokers supported by Sharesight\n\nSharesight supports [over 200 brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/)
  throughout Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom,
  Europe and Asia – and we are always looking to add more. For example, Sharesight
  users can automatically import trades from leading brokers such as [CommSec](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/easily-track-trades-with-commsec-using-sharesight/),
  [SelfWealth](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-selfwealth-trades-into-sharesight/),
  [ASB Securities](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/easily-import-asb-securities-trades-into-sharesight/),
  [Hargreaves Lansdown](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-hargreaves-lansdown-trades/)
  and [Robinhood](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-robinhood-trades-into-sharesight/),
  just to name a few. The full list of brokers supported by Sharesight can be found
  [here](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/). \n\n## Why you should track
  your global investments with Sharesight\n\nSharesight’s support for [more than 200
  global brokers](https://help.sharesight.com/supported-brokers/), [over 75 currencies](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/track-investments-in-fx-currencies-with-sharesight/)
  and [over 40 leading stock exchanges](https://www.sharesight.com/faq/#which-stock-exchanges-does-sharesight-support)
  allows global investors to take advantage of Sharesight’s award-winning performance,
  [dividend tracking](https://www.sharesight.com/dividend-tracker/) and tax reporting
  features. Unlike the data provided by most brokers, Sharesight gives investors the
  true picture of their investment performance by taking into account the impact of
  brokerage fees, [dividends](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-tracking-dividends/)
  and capital gains on their returns. \n\nSharesight also offers a range of powerful
  reports for global investors including [Performance](https://help.sharesight.com/performance_report/),
  [Portfolio Diversity](https://help.sharesight.com/diversity_report/), [Contribution
  Analysis](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/explore-your-portfolio-performance-with-the-contribution-analysis-report/),
  [Multi-Currency Valuation](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/value-your-investments-in-any-currency-with-sharesight/)
  and [Future Income](https://help.sharesight.com/future_income/) (upcoming dividends).
  The ability to automatically import your trading history to your portfolio is just
  another reason that investors should consider using Sharesight to track their investment
  portfolio. \n\n## It’s easy to import your trades via email\n\nSharesight’s [Trade
  Confirmation Emails](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/automatically-import-trades-to-your-sharesight-portfolio-using-email/)
  feature is an effortless way to import historical and ongoing trades to a Sharesight
  portfolio. By simply having your broker’s trade confirmations forwarded to your
  unique Sharesight email address, all of your trades are synced to your portfolio,
  inclusive of corporate actions such as dividends, mergers and stock splits, with
  no effort on your part. \n\n### Other convenient ways to import your trades\n\nThere
  are numerous other ways to import your trades to a Sharesight portfolio. For example,
  if you wish to bulk import a large number of historical trades, you may find it
  convenient to upload your trades via a [spreadsheet file](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/import-trades-with-the-sharesight-file-importer/).
  If your broker is connected to the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api),
  you can also establish a secure connection to your brokerage account that will automatically
  upload all of your historical and ongoing trades to Sharesight. Or if you are simply
  looking to add one or two additional trades to your portfolio, there is also the
  option to manually add your trades, if you wish. \n\n## Help us add support for
  more global brokers\n\nAre you trading through a broker not currently [supported
  by Sharesight](https://help.sharesight.com/supported_brokers/)? Help us add support
  for your broker by leaving a message in the chat interface located at the bottom-right
  of Sharesight, or by letting us know at the [Sharesight Community](https://community.sharesight.com/t/do-you-use-a-broker-that-sharesight-does-not-currently-support/284).
  All we will need is some sample buy and sell trade confirmations (email or PDF)
  and the email the broker sends them from.\n\nWe only require a few sample documents
  to support a new broker, so reach out today if you want to see yours added!\n\n##
