:title: Sharesight named a Cuffelinks Alliance Partner
:url_slug: sharesight-named-cuffelinks-alliance-partner
:content: "We're pleased to announce that we've been named a [Cufflelinks](https://cuffelinks.com.au)
  Alliance Partner. This means that some of our thought pieces will appear on their
  site and we'll aim to point our clients towards relevant content of theirs. \n\nCuffelinks
  is a free investment newsletter written by financial market professionals with experience
  in wealth management, superannuation, banking, academia and financial advice. They
  speak to engaged investors and financial services professionals.\n\n![Cuffelinks

  me, their content is a must read every Thursday night. They provide a healthy mix
  of investment research across asset classes, thoughts on government policy, and
  technical deep dives for portfolio accounting wonks. The best part is that it's
  fiercely independent.\n\nThe three principals behind Cuffelinks are an experienced
  group: Chris Cuffe, Graham Hand, and David Bell. It's worth [checking out their
  CVs](https://cuffelinks.com.au/about-us/our-principals/).\n\nFor more information,
  visit the [Cuffelinks website](https://cuffelinks.com.au) and follow Cuffelinks
  on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/5142446) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cuffelinks)."
