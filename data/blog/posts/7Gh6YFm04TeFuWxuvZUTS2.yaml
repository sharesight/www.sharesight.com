  What is the Oslo Stock Exchange?\n\nFounded in 1819, the [Oslo Stock Exchange](https://www.oslobors.no/ob_eng/)
  (OSE), also known as the Oslo Bors, is Norway’s only regulated market for securities
  trading. The OSE includes stocks, bonds, derivatives and fixed income instruments,
  and is considered a leading exchange for the energy, shipping and seafood markets.
  As of 2019, it is owned by Europe’s largest stock exchange, the Euronext. \n\nSharesight
  tracks more than 250 stocks listed on the OSE, with more stocks continually being
  added over time. This is in addition to more than 1,000 other Nordic stocks and
  ETFs listed on Nasdaq’s Stockholm, Copenhagen, Iceland and Helsinki exchanges. Investors
  can also track stocks on major European markets such as the Euronext, London Stock
  Exchange (LSE) and Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FRA), plus a wide range of global markets.
  \n\n## How to track the Oslo Stock Exchange on Sharesight\n\n1. If you’re not using
  Sharesight yet, sign up for a [FREE account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup)
