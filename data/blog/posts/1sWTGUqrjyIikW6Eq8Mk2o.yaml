:title: Road ahead from Banking Royal Commission
:url_slug: road-ahead-from-banking-royal-commission
:content: "Even for the experienced investor, the revelations made during the Banking
  Royal Commission have been shocking. Charging [dead clients for financial advice](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-19/cba-charged-fees-to-customers-who-had-died-commission-hears/9675922)
  was a particular lowlight. Sadly, most of the news that came across my desk fell
  into the “tell me something I don’t know” category.\n\nNow that the Royal Commission
  has stretched on for more than a month, there are a few themes that we’ve been following
  at Sharesight, the behaviour of bad actors that ran the gamut of idiotic to outright
  theft notwithstanding.\n\n## Superannuation for good and evil\n\nAustralia’s [compulsory
  superannuation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia)
  is lauded worldwide because mandatory contributions do seem to provide good outcomes
  for most people. However, it also creates an expensive, bloated and lazy industry
  rife with conflicts of interest. \n\nThe list of business models with government-guaranteed
  sales is awfully short, and those 9.5% contributions from every Aussie paycheck
  do a lot to keep the skyline reaching higher and higher above Sydney Harbour.\n\n##
  It’s all about the plumbing\n\nInvestment portfolios, superannuation funds, and
  insurance policies are products that need to be sold, tracked, and safeguarded.
  The investment platform industry sprang up as a result and has been a focus of the
  Royal Commission. \n\nUnfortunately, due to commission-based pay for financial advisors,
  the platform itself became the product, not the underlying investment. \n\nPlatforms
  evolved to be sales tools for bankers - think Salesforce for investing. It didn’t
  matter what was on the platform, so long as the fund manager paid the right fees
  to be on it, the financial advisor got paid the right commission for selling the
  fund, and the client started pumping their money onto the platform.\n\nPlatforms
  are therefore closed systems, powered by uninspiring technology. Over time, the
  fees layer up and increase. As we’ve said time and time again, the fees you pay
  to invest are the most important thing because they never change. An investor who
  goes off platform [can save nearly 75% on fees](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/smsf-unbundling--how-much-can-it-save-you-in-2017/).\n\n##
  Open Banking to the rescue? \n\nThe pain and cost of switching investment providers
  or financial advisors helps propagate the platform industry.\n\nIf it carries a
  bank logo, you can be sure that it’s a closed system designed to benefit the institution,
  not you the investor. \n\n[Open Banking](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/open-banking-changes-in-australia/)
  was given the government’s tick of approval during the Royal Commission. For investors,
  this should mean that switching your investments and superannuation from one provider
  to the next should be frictionless. Sharesight looks forward to embracing the [coming
  Open Banking regime in Australia](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/open-banking-changes-in-australia/)
  and using it to build the next generation of fintech services.\n\nA few things need
  to happen for this to work. First, banks can’t drag the chain by delaying, or more
  likely degrading, access to client financial data. Second, companies like Sharesight
  must invest in systems to extract the data, and third investors must be motivated
  to use a product like Sharesight to move information from one place to another.\n\n##
  Good apples and financial education\n\nMost of us felt a sense of schadenfreude
  seeing bankers hauled in front of the Royal Commission on live TV no less. I don’t
  know if the bad behaviour on display represents most of the industry, but I can
  definitely say it does not represent all of it. \n\nOver the years, we’ve built
  partnerships with hundreds of [high quality financial advice practices](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/financial-advisors/)
  and [asset managers](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/asset-managers-and-robo-advisors/).
  In fact, when someone asks me to recommend an advisor, I always turn to our client
  base. \n\nThese advisors are overwhelmingly independent, and don’t take commissions
  from product providers. They may use a platform, but only if it suits the client’s
  needs. They attract and retain business the old-fashioned way by looking after the
  long-term interest of their clients.\n\nOne thing I fear is that this group of honest,
  high quality advisors are used mainly by people with enough money and time to do
  their research, or by those with the wherewithal to follow an event like the Royal
  Commission.\n\nThe investment industry thrives behind a cloak of manufactured complexity
  and elitism. The movie, *The Big Short* was successful because the filmmakers did
  an incredible job of explaining what a [credit default swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp)
  on mortgage backed securities was.\n\nAnd because basic financial education is terribly
  lacking in Australia, and most of the world, events like the Royal Commission do
  more to damage the entire industry than to encourage people to gain knowledge and
  take action.\n\nEveryone from the white knights of the industry to fintechs like
  Sharesight have a big job ahead of them.\n\n### FURTHER READING\n\n- [Why Australia
