:title: Sharesight release notes - June 2019
:content: "June saw a continued focus on improving site performance with major improvements
  to the load speed of our charts, particularly the valuation chart. We didn’t quite
  manage a public release of our [Interactive Brokers integration](https://getsatisfaction.com/sharesight/topics/add_interactive_brokers)
  as anticipated but have now added support for multi account file structures and
  a range of other improvements to ensure the accuracy and reliability of this service.
  \n\nAs a reminder, users who want early access to features we’re developing like
  our Interactive Brokers Integration, should [join the Sharesight Beta Program](https://help.sharesight.com/nz/beta/).\n\n![Sharesight

  Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/). We will be rolling this out
  to all other reports in the near future.\n\n### Broker Import\n\n* Added support
  for Jarden Trade Confirmation Emails (NZ) following rebrand from First NZ Capital.\n\n*
  Added [CSV Broker Import support for Stake](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/stake-clients-can-now-easily-track-trades-using-sharesight/)
