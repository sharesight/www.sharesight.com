:title: Cate Blanchett, queen of 100% investment returns?
:content: "Cate Blanchett is a terrific actor. She’s won two Academy Awards and has
  starred in everything from The Lord of the Rings to The Aviator.\n\nBut did you
  know she’s also a shrewd property investor who doesn’t settle for anything less
  than a 100% return? Who needs acting (or stocks) when you can flip houses?\n\nIn
  late 2016, it was widely reported that [Blanchett sold her Sydney house for $19.8M](http://m.realestate.com.au/news/blanchettupton-hunters-hill-mansion-expected-to-have-broken-suburb-record/news-story/c6a1bd72aabd9c58db58e3a06f70158d).
  She bought the house for $10M in 2005. Ok, technically that’s a 98% return, but
  still, the press was agog over her incredible return. Clickbait to be sure (I took
  a look at the photos -- it’s a stunning house).\n\n![featured - Cate Blanchett](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5BPVKOWc3C6mqaMAOSoKG/3428dd4d2fa84082f9cca55341d12314/featured_cate-blanchett.jpg?w=950)\n<figure
  align=\"right\">Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/berlin-germany-february-13-cate-blanchett-259047155\">Shutterstock</a></figure>\n\nClearly,
  Blanchett predicted the Australian housing boom and envisioned the post financial
  crisis interest rate environment, right? Maybe Blanchett really is an astute property
  investor, or maybe she got some great advice. Maybe she just wanted to live in a
  movie star worthy house on Sydney Harbour.\n\nBut in any case, it’s human nature
  to look at these numbers and think, “Wow! Cate Blanchett just pocketed $9.8M. Where
  else could you make that kind of return?”\n\nThe answer is usually nowhere. And
  Cate Blanchett didn’t pocket $10M in cash either.\n\nThere are three hugely important
  factors missing from the above calculation. \n\n1. How long did Blanchett own the
  house?\n\n2. How much money did she spend upgrading and maintaining the property?\n\n3.
  What were her transaction costs when buying and selling?\n\nShe owned the house
  for 11 years, so while her total return is 98%, on an annualised basis that’s actually
  a return of 8.16%. Historically 8% is about the return an investor could expect
  from the stock market.\n\n| Total Return       | 98%       |\n| Real Return       |
  8.16%       |\n\nAnnualisation is critical because it puts investment performance
  in the same terms as everything else in our financial life. You get paid an annual
  salary. Schools quote tuition annually. Budgets are done yearly. Human beings think
  in one year blocks because it helps us estimate opportunity cost and it’s how we
  make real life comparisons.\n\nUnfortunately, annualising (like compounding) is
  impossible for people to do in their heads, but it’s worth spending the time and
  energy to figure it out.\n\nSo what would Cate’s money have done in the stock market?
  To find out, I added Cate’s house to a [Sharesight](/) portfolio and compared it
  to an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 (SPY).\n\n![screenshot - Cate Blanchett House

  would have been better off investing her $10M in the stock market. \n\nIncluding
  dividends and currency effects, the difference between 8.16% and 10.52% annualised
  over 11 years is a whopping $6.8M!\n\n\n|      | Total Annualized Return     | Total
  Gain     |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| Cate’s House       | 8.16%
  \      | $9,800,000       |\n| S&P 500 ETF (SPY)       | 10.52%       | $16,587,336
  \      |\n\nUnfortunately, the story of Cate’s <del>100%</del> 8.16% return gets
  way worse. \n\nThe tabloids also reported she spent $8M over three years refurbishing
  the property. Let’s assume that was done in three equal $2.67M projects during the
  first three years of ownership.\n\nOh and we can’t forget the stamp duty she had
  to pay when buying the house, which totals $640,000 plus the 2% real estate agent
  fee she paid when selling, which works out to be $396,000.\n\nThis drastically changes
  her situation. She’s had to invest heavily in the asset to justify its ultimate
  sale price and paid huge transaction fees. If we account for this in Sharesight,
  you’ll see that her annual return plummets to 0.37%!\n\n![Screenshot - Cate Blanchett

  in just over a decade Cate Blanchett’s $10M investment plus $8M top-up netted her
  $762k. If she had put the initial $10M in the S&P 500, plus the $8M top up, she’d
  find her balance at over $40M today.**\n\n|      | Total Annualized Return     |
  Total Gain<sup>1</sup>     |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| Cate’s
  House       | 0.37%       | $761,607       |\n| S&P 500 ETF (SPY)       | 10.52%
  \      | $22,698,623       |\n\n\n<small><sup>1</sup> Total Gain for the time period
  1 January 2005 to 31 December 2016. Includes property transaction costs and assumes
  brokerage fees of 10 basis points on all trades.</small>\n\nThe same rules apply
  to your portfolio, but the numbers elude you because they’re really hard to calculate.\n\nThe
  press routinely spouts off price changes in dramatic fashion, especially when it
  comes to IPOs. Fund managers tout their “total” or “lifetime” returns. To complicate
  things further, none of these talking points factor-in complexities like takeovers,
  spinoffs, and [reinvested dividends](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/).\n\nYour
  broker or share registry simply does not have the information available to calculate
  accurate portfolio performance numbers on your behalf.\n\nSo unless you break down
  these headline numbers into annual terms and understand the true cost of investing
  you’ll never know your [true performance](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/),
  nor what your money could have done for you.\n\n### Join the discussion\n[*Real
