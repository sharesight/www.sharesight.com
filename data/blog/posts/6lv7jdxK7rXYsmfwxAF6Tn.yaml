:content: "We are excited to announce that Joe Salvati has joined Sharesight in the
  role of Director of Partnerships to further grow the Sharesight pro and partnership
  side of the business. Moving to Sharesight from a number of Customer and Go-to-Market
  roles at Xero, Joe brings a wealth of knowledge about scaling software companies
  and the fintech B2B ecosystem to Sharesight. \n\nTo learn more about Joe, I sat
  down with him to find out more:\n\n![Image 0 Joe](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1GyRcX9BL2rfkZ9xYOkq8m/da60482eb688804a03349c2884341c9f/Image_0_Joe.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Can you tell us a bit about yourself? \n\nI’m originally from Chicago but left to
  move to New York City to pursue my dreams of becoming a professional musician. Drums
  were my instrument of choice. I had an incredible time in New York where I worked
  on establishing myself and my career to medium success. NYC is where I feel I truly
  became a grown up and is my hometown in my heart.    I moved to Melbourne in 2011
  for my partner’s work and undertook a Master’s in Entrepreneurship & Innovation
  from Swinburne University. My hope was that I would get an excellent education on
  running a business and return to NYC to help my musician friends grow their brands.
  \ \n\nFortuitously, while undertaking my Master’s some of my fellow classmates had
  started a SaaS payroll company called Paycycle.  They were kind of enough to bring
  me on where I learned a ton about the Accounting industry and started building my
  experience in software sales.   \n\nFour months after I joined Paycycle we were
  acquired by Xero (accounting software) as their first acquisition. I then joined
  Xero as one of their first 200 employees globally.  Over the next nine years it
  was a rocket ship of a ride helping the Australian business scale from $2 million
  to over $350 Million in Annualized Revenue.   I feel really fortunate to have had
  the opportunity to learn so much over that time as it really taught me how to make
  decisions based on the facts at hand and move quickly. \n\n## What excites you the
  most about Sharesight?\n\nSharesight is an incredibly exciting business that I have
  been keeping an eye on for many years. The chance to join the team and help shape
  the next phase of the business is something I have really been looking forward to.
  Currently, I am only a few weeks into the job and I have learned heaps.  It feels
  great to be continually challenged and learning everyday. \n\n## What are your top
  priorities as Sharesight Sales Director?\n\nThe team has tripled over the last two
  months so my main focus is to help build an incredibly strong and close knit team.
  As we develop as a business unit I look forward to creating the foundation for us
  to continue scaling and have an impact far beyond the size of our team. \n\n## What
  do you enjoy doing when you’re not at Sharesight?\n\nI really enjoy hanging out
  with my two daughters who are 7 & 4. In addition to teaching myself the piano I
  love reading and listening to podcasts.  To keep myself young and embarrass my children
  I try and stay up to date with what is happening musically and culturally. (I’m
  still not great at flossing). I’m referring to the dance. My teeth game is strong.
  \n\n## Tell us something most people don’t know about yourself\n\nI was born at
  28 weeks in 1982, weighing 2lbs 4oz ( 1.02 KG). I was the same size as a $5 bill.
  Anytime I meet parents of premature babies I make a point to tell them my story.
  Besides my terrible sense of humor I’ve turned out ok.\n\n## Join the Sharesight
  partner ecosystem today\n\nJoe and the team at Sharesight are always excited to
  explore opportunities to work and partner with like minded companies. If anything
  offered by Sharesight or our [API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) would benefit
  your business, platform, or website please [send Joe an email](mailto:sales@sharesight.com)
  or reach out [via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joesalvati/) to start the
