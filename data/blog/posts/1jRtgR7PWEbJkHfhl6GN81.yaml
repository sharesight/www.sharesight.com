:title: Forwardcaster integrates with Sharesight API
:content: "[Forwardcaster](https://forwardcaster.com) is now able to offer investors
  the ability to track and monitor their equity investment strategies linked to their
  Sharesight portfolios.\n\nThis integration was made possible with the [Sharesight
  API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api), which was quick and easy to implement.
  We got it up and running in just a few weeks. In that time, we’ve added a lot of
  value, as together we’re more than the sum of our parts.\n\n![featured sharesight-forwardcaster](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4meROvSMxjEHxspYW0jHVt/190ea24503923fc09c918b68045afd4f/featured_sharesight-forwardcaster.png?w=950)\n\n##
  What is Forwardcaster?\n\nForwardcaster is a quantitative value [backtesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp)
  engine. Due to the computing power involved, quantitative value investing is a relatively
  new phenomenon. The investment philosophy is to merge the probabilities and statistics
  used by quants with the fundamental approaches to value investing as practiced by
  Warren Buffett and other leading value investors. \n\nUsing Forwardcaster, investors
  can use this method of investing by building and testing their own long-term stock
  market strategies. Once they’ve created a strategy they like, they can link it to
  their portfolio/s in order to track the results each day, week or month.\n\nFollowing
  a well-tested strategy helps to remove the emotion (and reduce some of the stress)
  from investing and provides a rational basis for improved performance. \n\n### How
  does Forwardcaster work?\n\nTypically, our engine analyses over 30 million data
  points of market history and takes less than 5 seconds to run. In that time, it
  has analysed the market over a period of up to 15 years by simulating the buying
  and selling of companies based on certain buy/sell criteria set by the investor.
  \n\nThe result is the performance of a hypothetical portfolio (i.e. a strategy)
  over a period of market history. Investors will see whether or not their strategy
  outperformed the market, they can dig into the risk metrics to see how volatile
  it was, and view the companies which drove returns. All of this can be achieved
  with our engine (and a top-quality database) in a few seconds -- without the risk
  of losing any capital. \n\n## Why Forwardcaster integrated with Sharesight \n\nSharesight
  and Forwardcaster solve two complementary problems. Sharesight offers investment
  portfolio performance and reporting, while Forwardcaster offers the ability to build
  and test investment strategies. \n\nThis integration allows Sharesight members to
  import their portfolios into Forwardcaster and link them to investment strategies
  they have created. This means Sharesight members can now get portfolio specific,
  data-driven investment ideas each day, week or month. It saves time, mitigates risk
  and helps to improve returns.\n\n### Sharesight’s straightforward API made integration
  easy\n\nUsing the Sharesight API was very straightforward. Sharesight monitored
  their end-points -- ensuring we were hitting them correctly -- while from our end,
  we could see exactly what we needed to see and where to get it from. In all, the
  whole integration process only took a few weeks to get up and running. In addition,
  the Sharesight team was great to work with.\n\nI highly recommended working with
  Sharesight. You’ll get everything you need up and running in no time and it will
  massively add value to your customers and your business.\n\n## Get started with
