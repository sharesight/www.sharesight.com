:title: Australian ETF distribution components now available for FY20/21
:url_slug: australian-etf-distribution-components-now-available-for-fy20-21
:content: "Sharesight now has updated ETF distribution component information for the
  FY20/21 Australian tax year for all [Russell Investments](https://russellinvestments.com/au/solutions/exchange-traded-funds/overview),
  [ETF Securities](https://www.etfsecurities.com.au/) and [Vanguard](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/productType=etf)
  ETFs, as well as updated distribution data directly from [Betashares](https://www.betashares.com.au/)
  and [Van Eck](https://www.vaneck.com.au/), plus (most) [iShares (BlackRock)](https://www.blackrock.com/au/individual/ishares)
  ETFs. \n\nThis means that for the majority of ETFs in Australia, Sharesight users
  will not need to manually update their ETF distribution components using [Sharesight’s
  pro-rata form](https://help.sharesight.com/au-amit-tax-components/) to ensure the
  cost-base for these ETFs is correctly adjusted and recorded in their portfolio.\n\nInvestors
  need to keep accurate records of these cost-base adjustments on ETFs in their portfolios
  for tax purposes, as the cost-base factors into capital gains tax calculations should
  these ETFs be sold.\n\n## AMIT tax components for ETFs in Australia\n\n[ETFs (Exchange
  Traded Funds)](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/types-of-exchange-traded-funds-etfs-explained/)
  are a type of unitised investment fund that can be bought and sold on stock exchanges
  such as the ASX, these funds often pay distribution income to shareholders throughout
  the financial year for any income earned by the fund. \n\nSince 2016, Australian
  ETFs can be structured as [Attribution Managed Investment Trusts](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  (AMITs), this is an evolution of the Managed Investment Trust (MIT) structure that
  allows trustees to ‘attribute’ taxable income to unit holders, without the need
  to distribute that income immediately. \n\n*This means investors may need to record
  a cost base increase when the attributed taxable income exceeds the distribution
  paid to the unit holder during the financial year.*\n\n## Sharesight’s ETF distribution
  data\n\nSharesight receives estimates of the gross distribution values from the
  [ASX when they are announced](https://www.sharesight.com/partners/asx/), *however
  [AMIT components](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/attribution-managed-investment-trust-amit-tax-calculations/)
  are only finalised when fund managers know the breakdown of income earned by the
  trusts*, and then they make these values available to unit holders by issuing year-end
  [AMMA tax statements](https://help.sharesight.com/au/au-amit-tax-components/). \n\nThis
  means that the distribution values Sharesight receives from the ASX throughout the
  year *do not contain* AMIT component breakdowns. Sharesight has worked directly
  with the registries and fund managers involved to collect raw data for the majority
  of these AMIT trusts, which we then use to calculate the component values for individual
  ETF holdings. \n\nFor ETFs where Sharesight has data, users will be able to accept
  these values if they have not yet confirmed the distribution payment. Where users
  have already confirmed the payment or used the pro-rata form and want to return
  to the original values, clicking ‘reset this payout’ when editing the distribution
  will revert the data to the updated values we’ve received - this will also reset
  any file attachments on the payout, so please ensure you save and re-attach these
  .\n\nYou can see how this process works in Sharesight by viewing the video below
  on how to confirm the ETF distribution components in Sharesight before running the
  Taxable Income Report to ensure the values match your AMMA statement. \n\n![Reset

  Because each ETF fund manager uses slightly different calculations to determine
  unit holders’ AMMA tax statement values, we highly recommend double-checking the
  values in Sharesight against your AMMA statement, as while we expect these to be
  correct in most situations, it’s possible a particular ETF/manager uses a different
  calculation to Sharesight.** \n\nIf you have any questions about how to handle AMIT
  components in Sharesight, ask in our [ETF tax components discussion](https://community.sharesight.com/t/australian-etf-components-now-updated-for-fy-2020-2021/650)
  in the [Sharesight Community](https://community.sharesight.com/) or message support
  when logged in to your account.\n\n## How AMIT cost base adjustments impact performance\n\nSharesight
  takes into account both AMIT cost base increase and decrease components when calculating
  investment performance. Here’s how it works in each scenario.\n\n### AMIT cost base
  decrease\n\nWhen calculating performance, Sharesight adds the AMIT cost base decrease
  component to your gross dividend given that it represents cash received that was
  not attributed to you.\n\n### AMIT cost base increase\n\nWhen calculating performance,
  Sharesight deducts the AMIT cost base increase from your gross dividend given that
  it reduces your attributed income to the net cash amount you actually received.\n\n##
