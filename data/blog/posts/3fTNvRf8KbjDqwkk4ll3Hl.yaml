:title: Sharesight release notes - September 2020
:content: |-
  A highlight for September was sourcing and loading [finalised ETF components for all ASX listed](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/australian-etf-distribution-components-now-available-for-fy1920/) Vanguard, iShares, Russell, ETFS, Betashares, Van Eck ETFs. This provides complete and accurate tax breakdowns necessary for Australian customers to complete their tax returns. We have greatly enhanced our backend automation which has allowed us to have this data available a month earlier than last year.
