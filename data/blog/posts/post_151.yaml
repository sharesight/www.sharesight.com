:title: Know your KiwiSaver portfolio
:url_slug: know-your-portfolio
:content: "I was amazed to see the claim in article [Portfolio Secrecy](http://www.pressdisplay.com/pressdisplay/showlink.aspx?bookmarkid=AB5IAKNOEGJ6&preview=magnifier&linkid=57a749b5-2ef9-4614-a50d-7e160892bd22)
  in the Sunday Star Times on 20 April that KiwiSaver providers keep their portfolios
  'secret'.\n\nSome claim their portfolios are their intellectual property, but given
  their performance of late and likelihood that they won’t outperform market averages
  in the long run the cynic might ask what value they are trying to protect.\n\nIt
  was noted in the article that 'keeping portfolio information secret made it hard
  for investors to cry foul over poor stock picking and easier for firms to peddle
  lame excuses for poor performance.' I can’t help suspecting that, sadly, this is
  much closer to the truth than the need to protect 'intellectual property'.\n\nThe
  thing that irks me most is that investors have the right to know what is being done
  with their money. Most are very conscious about how much they earn and how they
  spend their money. But when it comes to savings they are conditioned to accept very
  sketchy information about what has been done with their savings and infrequent information
  about what is their rate of return. \n\nKiwiSaver providers should be encouraging
  investors to take an active interest in their investments and in how their portfolio
  is performing. It should be made mandatory for them to provide portfolio breakdown
  and asset allocation information at least monthly as well as online access to the
  true annualised performance of each investment and the total portfolio that is updated
  every day.\n\nWhy? Well if KiwiSavers were provided with this information many would
  become much more interested, knowledgeable and committed investors. This would,
  in time, lead some to the conclusion that they could do better making their own
  investment decisions and managing their own portfolios. (Which is another reason
  why providing this information would have to be mandatory!)\n\nThrough KiwiSaver
  we have an ideal opportunity to encourage Kiwis to broaden their investment horizons
  beyond bank deposits, finance companies and residential property. Hopefully more
  Kiwis will also see the benefits of investing directly in the share market in their
  own right. Then we will finally see a much needed improvement in Kiwis’ truly woeful
  record of direct investment in the share market.\n\nAn article in the Dominion post
  today claims [*Low-cost KiwiSaver schemes doomed to fail*](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/377486/Low-cost-KiwiSaver-schemes-doomed-to-fail).
  It hints strongly that low fees will impact on the provision of a decent service
  and presumably the ability to provide decent information to investors. I cannot
  help wondering whether the gripe about low fees is a bit self-serving but be that
  as it may, the failure to provide comprehensive information to investors is simply
  not acceptable.\n\nDIY investors in the NZ and Australian share markets can access
  all the portfolio information they need at little cost through [Sharesight](/) and
  investors should expect no less from their KiwiSaver provider.\n\n<small>*This information
  is not a recommendation nor a statement of opinion. You should consult an independent
  financial adviser before making any decisions with respect to your shares in relation
  to the information that is presented in this article.*</small>\n\n### FURTHER READING\n-
