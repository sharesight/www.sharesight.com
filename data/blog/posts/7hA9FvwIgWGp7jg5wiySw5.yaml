:title: Pearler integrates with the Sharesight API
:content: "[Pearler](http://pearler.com/) now integrates directly with the Sharesight
  API to send transaction data directly to Sharesight, making life easier for our
  customers to conduct performance and tax reporting.\n\nAs Australia’s only online
  broker focused on long-term investing, Pearler is all about making it easier for
  everyday Australians to buy and accumulate shares. Our Sharesight integration means
  that it’s now extremely straightforward for our customers to meet their investment
  reporting needs.\n\nIn fact, a large segment of our early adopters are avid Sharesight
  users, so it was a no-brainer for us to make their lives easier by connecting their
  favourite investing tool (Pearler) with their favourite reporting tool (Sharesight)
  using the [Sharesight API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api).\n\n![Pearler Integrates

  What is Pearler?\n\nPearler is an online broker for long-term Aussie investors.
  The company was founded by three friends from Sydney in 2018 after we got fed up
  with only having two bad options to refer our friends to when they wanted to start
  investing – confusing trading platforms or expensive micro-investment apps. \n\nJust
  like other brokers, Pearler allows investors to invest directly into shares and
  ETFs. But where we differ is that instead of designing our platform around the buying
  and selling (\"trading\") experience, we’ve built Pearler from the ground up to
  focus on the thing that matters most – helping people achieve their long-term financial
  goals.\n\nTo do this we’ve got features like Goals and Autoinvest, which together
  allow you to set a goal (e.g. financial independence), then automate your investing
  strategy to achieve these outcomes, and track your progress along the way. \n\nWe’ve
  also embedded community elements in our platform – we make it easy for our investors
  to compare and share their portfolios with friends, family and ‘Finfluencers’. Users
  can discover the most popular stocks and ETFs too, amongst other great features.
  \n\nOur goal is to make it easy for every Aussie to invest in shares the right way
  – incremental amounts in diversified portfolios, for the long-term.\n\n### What’s
  different about Pearler?\n\nOne word: **Long-term**. \n\nWe’ve literally specifically
  designed Pearler for long-term investors.\n\nMost low-cost brokers focus all their
  energy on making the trading experience better.  Limit orders, market depths, weekly
  performance updates, the list goes on… none of this helps a long-term investor!\n\nWe’ve
  removed all this trading crap and replaced it with genuine long-term investing features
  like Autoinvest, Goals and Shareable Portfolios.\n\nRather than go through everything
  line by line, here’s a summary from our [pricing page](https://pearler.com/pricing):\n\n![Pearler
  Features](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/3E1qhCtPIMaspZHtJEJ9XK/903dbd75557644e0fb9322acad53ecec/Pearler_Features.png?w=950)\n\n##
  Why did Pearler integrate with Sharesight?\n\nSharesight and Pearler solve two complementary
  problems. Pearler makes it easy to invest for the long-term, while Sharesight makes
  it easy to measure long-term portfolio performance.\n\nNow every long-term investor
  in Australia can automate both their investments and their reporting. This saves
  a significant amount of time, maximises returns and reduces stress.  \n\nThe integration
  was quick and easy using the Sharesight API, with the integration up and running
  with only light resourcing over a couple of months. \n\n## Get started with Pearler
