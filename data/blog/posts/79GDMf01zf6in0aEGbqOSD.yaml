  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nIn this Sharesight20ASX
  weekly snapshot of Sharesight users' top 20 trades on the ASX, CSL (ASX: CSL) dominates
  the list of buy trades, with investors likely anticipating a share price increase
  due to the company’s involvement in Coronavirus vaccine trials and (potentially)
  manufacturing. We are also seeing a continued trend of Australian investors selling
  off buy-now-pay-later stocks, as ‘bubble stock’ fears grow. \n\n## Top 20 ASX trades
