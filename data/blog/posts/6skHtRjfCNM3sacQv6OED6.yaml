:content: "At an [ausbiz](https://www.ausbiz.com.au/signup) panel for DIY investors
  called **‘Tech Tips to Maximise Portfolio Performance’**, Sharesight CEO Doug Morris
  explored the benefits of harnessing technology to manage your SMSF, rather than
  relying on expensive bank-owned platforms. Some of the topics discussed included
  how investors can make the switch from platform to DIY tech stack; how SMSF investors
  can save thousands of dollars in management fees; and whether there are any potential
  risks of taking a self-directed approach to managing an SMSF.\n\n## Watch the segment
