:title: What is an ISA in the UK?
:url_slug: what-is-an-isa-in-the-uk
:content: "An Individual Savings Account or ISA is [a savings account that offers
  UK residents](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts) a favourable tax status
  when investing. First introduced in 1999, an exemption from both income tax and
  capital gains tax is the main difference between an ISA and other types of savings
  accounts. However, while an ISA lets investors earn interest without paying any
  income tax, they are limited in terms of how much they can top up these accounts.
  \n\n![What is an ISA](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/1BZ6bEP6Yo5BP4ZGyaKDE5/521a0040d667813d2f2bce0eb276c03f/What_is_an_ISA.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  How do ISAs work?\n\nEvery tax year savings account holders are given an ISA allowance
  to save or invest money up to a certain amount without paying tax on their returns.
  [Cash and a broad range of investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_savings_account)
  can be held within the arrangement and there is no restriction on when or how much
  money can be withdrawn. The tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April the following
  year, meaning investors have until 5 April 2022 to use up their ISA allowance for
  the 2021-22 tax year, for example. The new tax year brings with it a new ISA allowance
  and any unused ISA allowance cannot be carried forward from one tax year to the
  next.\n\n## ISA types\n\nThere are several different types of ISA to suit the varying
  needs of UK residents. The four main types for adults are Cash ISAs, Investment
  ISAs (also known as a [Stocks and Shares ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_savings_account#Stocks_and_shares_ISA)),
  Innovative Finance ISAs and Lifetime ISAs, which are subject to strict rules. Each
  taxpayer has an annual investment limit (£20,000 as of 2020-21) which can be placed
  in a single ISA or split amongst any combination of the four types. An exception
  to this is the Lifetime ISA, which is capped at £4,000 each year, until the investor
  turns 50. Additionally, children under 18 may hold a Junior ISA, which has a separate
  annual limit and can’t be accessed by the child until they turn 18. \n\n## How do
  Investment ISAs work?\n\nStocks and Shares ISAs are a popular method of investing
  in the stock market as investors can access assets like shares, bonds, property
  and commodities − with the added benefit of [not paying any tax on the capital gains
  or income](https://www.money.co.uk/savings-accounts/what-is-an-isa.htm) (interest
  and dividends) they earn. In other words, the investor can keep everything they
  earn from an Investment ISA after charges and fees are taken. However, to hold a
  Stocks and Shares ISA you must be a UK resident aged 18 or over and it may be worth
  seeking financial advice before investing in one of the many stock exchanges you
  will be able to access. You can’t open a Stocks and Shares ISA for someone else.\n\n##
  What can I invest in?\n\nInvestment ISAs have the potential for higher returns than
  a cash deposit and offer the chance to invest in a [broad range of assets](https://uk.advfn.com/Help/10-what-kinds-of-stocks-and-other-inves-366.html)
  including shares, bonds and trusts. As this suggests, the range of ISA-qualifying
  equity and securities investments is extensive. It includes:\n\n* Stocks and securities
  issued by a company incorporated anywhere in the world and listed on any HM Revenue
  & Customs recognised stock exchange. \n\n* Securities may include government bonds,
  corporate bonds, loans, loan stock, debentures and Eurobonds, provided they have
  at least five years to run when first acquired for the ISA. \n\n* Units in qualifying
  authorised Unit trusts and qualifying investment trusts\n\n* Shares in qualifying
  open ended investment companies (OEICs)\n\n* Units or shares in a relevant undertaking
  for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)\n\n* Investment companies
  with variable capital (ICVCs)\n\n* Shares acquired by employees from an approved
  all-employee savings related share option and/or profit-sharing scheme. \n\n## Why
  do investors invest through an ISA?\n\nISAs are designed to be simple accounts for
  making tax-free savings and investments and have very clear benefits. The Government
  introduced them to encourage people to save for the future. Account holders can
  pay a total of £20,000 a year into their Stocks and Shares ISA in the 2021-22 tax
  year. However, they can’t put money into the same type of ISA in the same tax year.
  For example, if they had two Stocks and Shares ISAs, they would need to wait until
  the next tax year to put money into the second ISA. [Benefits include](https://www.barclays.co.uk/smart-investor/accounts/investment-isa/four-reasons-to-consider-using-your-isa-allowance/)
  the ability to make a lump sum investment and/or regular or ad hoc contributions
  throughout the tax year. Any increase in the value of the underlying investments
  is free of capital gains tax while investors don’t have to declare ISAs on their
  annual tax return.\n\n## Track the performance of your ISA investments with Sharesight\n\nThousands
