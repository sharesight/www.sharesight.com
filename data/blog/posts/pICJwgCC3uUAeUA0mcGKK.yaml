:title: 3 reasons why dividend tracking is crucial
:content: "Income received from stock dividends is a critical part of household income
  and retirement planning for millions of investors. In an age of extra low interest
  rates, listed companies paying healthy dividends are one of the last places you
  can find meaningful yield.\n\n![Featured - Monopoly Dividend](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2bFfeC3Hx2Co6OOyWk626K/e3aadda853bfd0ea72d974a177ddb368/featured_monopoly-dividend.jpg?w=950)\n\nMerely
  counting up the cash you receive from dividends doesn’t go far enough. Dividends
  must be factored into the bigger picture -- your overall investment performance.
  To be successful, every dividend investor needs to understand:\n\n1. **How to properly
  track the cash you receive**\n2. **The tax implications**\n3. **The impact of dividend
  reinvesting**\n\nLet’s look at my holding in Australian telecom giant Telstra (ASX:TLS)
  to illustrate.\n\n![screenshot - Dividend Tracking 1](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/2RifpeL41O8GMg8mcwCMm/d2dfc7839949bcf355096db5b47640d8/screenshot_dividend-tracking-1.png?w=950)\n\n##
  The cash you receive\n\nThis is what dividend investing is all about, but it’s an
  admin nightmare. Listed companies, ETFs, and managed funds pay registries to track
  who owns how many shares, but also to dispense dividends. For my Australian portfolio,
  I’m forced to use three separate registries. This means three logins, three types
  of snail mail, three types of email alerts, and three sources of dividends that
  need to be manually compiled at tax time.\n\nIn the case of Telstra, the registry
  electronically debits the dividends to my bank account. This is handy (some companies
  send paper cheques), but even though it’s deposited in the same institution that
  I use for brokerage, the broker has no visibility across this data so they can’t
  calculate my dividend yield.\n\n[Sharesight](/) automatically receives dividend
  info from the stock exchange, so your dividend yield will be up to date regardless
  of how and where you actually receive the cash. In Telstra’s case dividends make
  up two-thirds of my total return, which I can see in percentage and dollar terms:\n\n![screenshot

  I can see each dividend received going back to my first investment in the stock:\n\n![screenshot

  The tax implications\n\nDividend income is typically taxed at the same rate as ordinary
  income, depending on entity type and your home country. Regardless, this means more
  admin pain.\n\nChecking your bank balance won’t help because you’ll only see the
  net amount. The registry is a the official source for dividend tax implications,
  but they fall short in two ways. One, you’ll need to rely on multiple registries
  to compile a portfolio-wide tax picture. Two, they only provide one year’s worth
  of data and [charge you a lot of money](/blog/dont-pay-for-your-investment-data/)
  to access prior year information.\n\nSharesight receives the same information as
  the registries (minus the official statements). Checking the March 2017 Telstra
  dividend shows just how much detail it captures automatically. You can see that
  Sharesight has already split-out the franking credits. Any other fields, such as
  withholding tax, will be automatically filled in where appropriate:\n\n![screenshot

  the [Taxable Income Report](https://help.sharesight.com/taxable_income/) gives you
  a portfolio-wide view for a date range of your choice. Handily, this report separate
  non-trust from trust income as well as domestic from foreign income:\n\n![screenshot

  The impact of dividend reinvesting\n\nAutomatically reinvesting dividends is a useful
  way to top up your portfolio and keep yourself as fully invested as possible --
  assuming you don’t need the cash. Some companies offer this via their registry.
  Unfortunately, dividend reinvesting brings an entirely new set of admin challenges
  for investors. \n\nFirst, your broker will have no idea that you’ve enrolled in
  a dividend reinvestment (DRP) plan since they don’t handle these transactions. Second,
  each dividend is reinvested at a specified amount and price. These facts combine
  to mean that your cost base and amount invested are constantly changing. It’s essentially
  impossible to calculate your true performance.\n\nSharesight lets you [enrol an
  entire holding into a dividend reinvestment plan, or reinvest specific dividends](/blog/how-to-track-a-dividend-reinvestment-plan/).
  It also automatically tell you the number of shares and reinvestment price:\n\n![screenshot

  every dividend received will be used to repurchase shares in the company, which
  Sharesight automatically factors into its performance calculations:\n\n![screenshot

  previously discussed the importance of properly [tracking your investment performance](/blog/how-your-brokers-performance-numbers-mislead-you/),
  but tracking the dividends you receive is just as crucial to your success as an
  investor. For a stock you’ve held for a long period of time that pays significant
  dividends you’ll eventually want to compare your total income to the cost base.
  In the case of my Telstra shares, a quick check of the [Historical Cost Report](https://help.sharesight.com/historical_cost_report/)
  shows me that over time my Telstra purchases total $4,463.83 whereas the total income
  received from dividends is $2,669.32. Not too much longer until Telstra pays for
  itself!\n\n## Track your dividends for FREE\nThe best way to understand what Sharesight
  is all about is to [sign up for a FREE account](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup),
  add your holdings, and watch as your dividends are automatically populated -- going
  back up to 20 years!\n\n### FURTHER READING\n- [5 ways to maximise returns in a
