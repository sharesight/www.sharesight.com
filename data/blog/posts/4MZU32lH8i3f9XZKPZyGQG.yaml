:title: Record keeping tips for SMSF trustees
:content: "###### Disclaimer: The below article is for informational purposes only
  and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice
  and should not be relied upon as such. Always check with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation. \n\nAs an SMSF trustee,
  there are a [strict set of record keeping guidelines set by the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/self-managed-super-funds/administering-and-reporting/record-keeping-requirements/)
  that must be adhered to. Developing a sound system of organising and storing records
  from establishment will make it easier for your SMSF to keep up with compliance
  requirements and maintain excellent administrative standards. It also allows you
  to see an accurate history of your funds, which can help to inform future decisions.
  \n\n![Record keeping tips for SMSF trustees](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/016786gwuk6gHrdWObKb13/b49c25ed5b5c9125c22d02a7a3705328/Record_keeping_tips_for_SMSF_trustees.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Records that your SMSF should keep\n\nMaintaining good reporting practices as an
  SMSF trustee [includes documenting](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Administering-and-reporting/):\n\n*
  Registration & ownership documentation\n\n* Minutes of all trustee meetings and
  decisions\n\n* Investment strategies\n\n* Trustee declarations\n\n* Annual audit
  reports & records\n\n* Tax returns\n\n* Operating statements\n\n* Bank statements
  & banking records\n\n* Compliance notices\n\n## Minutes of meetings\n\nThere are
  several important areas where detailed record taking is required. As a trustee,
  arguably the most common area of record keeping relates to the investment decisions
  that are being made. All decisions need to be documented through the taking  ‘minutes’
  of any decisions that are being made, and subsequent discussions, including:\n\n*
  Why a particular investment or set of investments were chosen\n\n* Whether all trustees
  agreed with the decision\n\n* Signature of all trustees\n\nMinutes need to be held
  for a [minimum of 10 years](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/self-managed-super-funds/administering-and-reporting/record-keeping-requirements/)
  and are an essential legal precaution that trustees should all take to protect themselves
  from legal repercussions that may arise with failed investments. If as a trustee,
  you invest money in an investment that fails, the [other SMSF trustees can take
  legal action against you for lack of diligence](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2012B00019/f519caa7-e4d9-40e0-b0fb-f62fc595061a).
  However, if your investment discussions and agreement was recorded in the form of
  minutes, including the signatures of all trustees, you will have a record of all
  trustees agreeing to the decision that had previously been made. \n\n## Annual SMSF
  audit\n\nAn up to date record of all documents are [required to be available to
  your SMSF auditor](https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/SMSF-independent-auditor-s-report/)
  at the end of each financial year for the annual return to be prepared. However,
  it is important that your fund’s records are always organised and available as the
  ATO may independently request your SMSF to provide them with a current copy of records.
  \n\n## Time frame for keeping records\n\nAll SMSF records are required to be held
  for a certain period of time depending on their importance. \n\nThe following records
  are required to be kept for a [minimum of five years](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/self-managed-super-funds/administering-and-reporting/record-keeping-requirements/)
  (ATO 2019):  \n\n* All accounting records, including explanations of transactions
  and the financial positions of your SMSF\n\n* Annual operating statements outlining
  your funds financial positions\n\n* Copies of all SMSF annual returns that have
  previously been lodged\n\n* Copies of any transfer balance account reports \n\n*
  Copies of any other statements that were required to be officially lodged to the
  ATO or other super funds.\n\nThe following records are needed to be kept for a [minimum
  of ten years](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/self-managed-super-funds/administering-and-reporting/record-keeping-requirements/)
  (ATO 2019):\n\n* Minutes of all trustee meetings and decisions\n\n* A record of
  changes in trustees\n\n* Trustee declarations recognising their obligations and
  responsibilities \n\n* Written consent of members being appointed as trustees\n\n*
  Copies of all reports provided to trustees\n\n* Reports relating to any contributions,
  deductions, capital gains and losses\n\n* Documents relating to the storage of collectables
  and personal use assets\n\n## Record your SMSF performance with Sharesight\n\nThe
