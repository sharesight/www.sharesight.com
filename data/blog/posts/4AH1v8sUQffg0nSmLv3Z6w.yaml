:title: 3 tips to manage investment risk during retirement

  and does not constitute a product recommendation, or taxation or financial advice
  and should not be relied upon as such. Always check with your financial adviser
  or accountant to obtain the correct advice for your situation.\n\nWhen you are a
  young and eager investor you may choose to take risks when it comes to your portfolio
  because you feel you have the time to make back any losses. As you get older you
  start to think longer term and this may mean limiting or removing any risky investments
  from your portfolio.\n\nThen you start to think about how your portfolio will fit
  into and help support your life in retirement. This will get you looking at how
  to manage the risks involved in investing so as to have enough cash flow to live
  off later in life.\n\nYour portfolio may form part of or all of your [SMSF](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/how-i-manage-my-smsf-with-sharesight/)
  or [RRSP/RSP](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/rrsp-and-rrif-canadian-tax-settings-in-sharesight-portfolios/)
  or it may just be something you use to boost your retirement savings. Whichever
  camp you fall into, you will want to limit your risk whilst still making a profit.\n\nAnother
  consideration will be the [stable but still weak global economy](https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/oecd-warns-global-economy-remains-weak-as-subdued-trade-drags-down-growth.htm)
  which will impact the investment choices you make and the performance of those investments.
  With economic uncertainty on the horizon you may be considering how you can best
  limit your risk without lowering your return.\n\nHere are a few ways to help maintain
  a healthy return whilst limiting the risk of your overall investment portfolio.\n\n![3
  tips to manage investment risk during retirement](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/4XnmBkTCaehdubXVpaYIgR/37819d0edbbc0725a32c4760ef0643db/3_tips_to_manage_investment_risk_during_retirement.jpg?w=950)\n\n##
  Diversification\n\nYou’ve no doubt heard the old saying ‘don’t put all your eggs
  in one basket’. This is a basic description of diversification. By keeping your
  portfolio diversified you limit your exposure if there is a single event that affects
  a particular investment or asset class. \n\nDiversification won’t guarantee you
  will avoid risk completely, in fact you may choose to add in some high risk investments
  within your portfolio, but by keeping your portfolio diversified you limit the impact
  of risky investments. This can get you the higher returns from the riskier investments
  whilst maintaining a stable return overall from the steadier or safer choices.\n\nThe
  main goal of investments that form part or all of your retirement portfolio is to
  create funds for you to live off during retirement. Keep this in mind when picking
  investments to make sure your mix is suitable for your personal circumstances.\n\nYou
  can monitor the diversity of your portfolio as well as its performance using [Sharesight’s
  Diversity Report](https://help.sharesight.com/au/diversity_report/). It gives you
  a breakdown of how diverse your portfolio is as well as allowing you to create custom
  groupings to monitor particular asset groupings.\n\n## Defensive asset allocation\n\nWhen
  building or managing your investment portfolio with the goal of funding, either
  fully or partially, your retirement you may choose to opt for a [defensive investment
  strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defensiveinvestmentstrategy.asp).
  A defensive investment strategy means you lower your risk but it also often lowers
  the return.\n\nBroadly speaking all investments fall into two asset classes, growth
  and defensive. A growth asset is built to give you high return whereas assets classed
  as defensive tend to be lower risk which in turn often means a lower return.\n\nDefensive
  assets include things such as cash in long term investment accounts or securities
  \ and bonds which you can access through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These assets
  are typically low growth and tend to only be affected by changing interest rates
  whereas growth assets such as shares can be affected by a multitude of other economic
  issues.\n\nThe best way to manage multiple asset types and allow for thorough monitoring
  of how your defensive assets are performing is to do in depth and comprehensive
  reporting. [Sharesight’s asset allocation reporting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/asset-allocation-reporting-in-sharesight/)
  allows you to group your assets by class as well as creating custom groups to manage
  them independent of what may be a typical grouping.\n\n## Be mindful of longevity
  risk\n\nLongevity risk is the [risk that you could outlive your retirement savings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_risk),
  either through an unexpected collapse in your portfolio value, or being fortunate
  enough to live longer than you expect (hopefully in good health!).\n\nTo mitigate
  this risk, some investors turn to products [such as annuities](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement/income-sources-in-retirement/income-from-super/annuities)
  that offer regular payments for either a set period, or set payments over your lifetime.\n\nSome
  may prefer to adopt the [\"dynamic-spending rule\"](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/articles/insights/research-commentary/retirement-and-superannuation/dynamic-approach.jsp)
  approach discussed by investment fund manager [Vanguard](https://www.vanguard.com/).
  With a dynamic spending rule approach, investors set a minimum and maximum percentage
  they are willing to draw down their portfolio each year, and should the portfolio
  perform poorly, adjust down their budget for spending that year to potentially overdraw
  the portfolio -- leaving less for later years.\n\nThe key to succeeding with the
  dynamic-spending rule approach is having the full picture of your investment portfolio
  and checking on its performance regularly, that’s where a portfolio tracking tool
  like [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/) is critical.\n\n## Take control of
