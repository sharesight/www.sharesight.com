:title: Investment research unbundled
:content: "When [Sharesight](/) was founded, we set out to solve a specific [investor
  problem](/about-sharesight/) -- helping people track their portfolios so they could
  gain an accurate picture of their performance. We were tempted along the way to
  branch out to other areas like research, advice, or broking, but sticking to our
  knitting has served our customers well.\n\nAt the same time other fintech companies
  were sprouting up with singular mission statements. Since the early days we’ve kept
  in close contact with these companies, and as the technology has improved we’ve
  even built seamless connections with several of them. \n\nFor investors, this means
  they now have an a-la-carte menu of specialist software providers. It used to be
  the menu of investments was selected for you by a bank or advice platform, execution
  had to be done with that same institution, and any means of reporting or insight
  was an afterthought - some of the statements I receive in the post still look like
  they were printed on a Soviet era press.\n\n![featured - elastic ball](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/5vm3Sv647uUekcYcawWCKk/e515c9bc74a04aac1dd79885a1f894a6/featured_elastic-ball.jpg?w=950)\n\nThis
  concept is known as [unbundling](/blog/what-is-unbundling-and-how-much-can-it-save-me/),
  and we like to think of ourselves as the \"Rebel Alliance\". I can’t take credit
  for applying the Star Wars moniker to fintech -- I believe it was Stuart Holdsworth
  at [Financial Simplicity](http://www.financialsimplicity.com/) who first used it.\n\nUnbundling
  has continued its steady march. Look no further than the recent news of Australian
  banks rethinking their financial planning businesses as a prime example. Once a
  business model with unmatched distribution and client captivity, banks now realise
  they can’t own 100% of a customer’s wallet. Customers are educating themselves and
  asking tough questions about results and fees.\n\n\n| &nbsp;     | Unbundled?     |
  Example     |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n|**Execution**|✔|CMC Markets|\n|**Accounting**|
  ✔|Xero|\n|**Research**|✔|finbox.io|\n|**Reporting**|✔|Sharesight|\n|**Advice**|✔|Six
  Park|\n|**Legal**|✔|LegalVision|\n|**Banking**|✔|ING Direct|\n\nWe’ve talked about
  several of these providers before, but an area that continues to develop is research
  -- not necessarily the approach, but how it’s disseminated.\n\nBank aligned, full
  service brokers used to produce the bulk of opinions, known as \"sell side research\".
  Major conflicts of interest were discovered in the wake of the GFC, which curtailed
  their output and benefitted firms like Morningstar who were seen as a bit of a disrupter
  in their own right.\n\nBut we’ve reached a time when the disrupter might be the
  disruptee.\n\nWe’re impressed  with [finbox.io](https://finbox.io/sharesight?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Promo-Sharesight&utm_source=sharesight),
  an online stock research platform designed for individual investors and asset managers
  who care about understanding a stock’s fundamental value. The platform provides
  a quick sanity check so that investors can understand what they’re investing in
  and why, which is the best way to reduce risk and increase returns.\n\n![finbox

  follows a traditional, fundamental approach to equity investing. However, they turn
  all the ingredients of their models over to you the investor via a slick interface.
  Finbox.io tracks any US-listed equities (including ADRs).\n\nYou can examine exactly
  how they’ve arrived at a fair value estimate, for example, but make changes to their
  inputs if you don’t agree. Advanced screeners lets you apply a range of conditions
  to their universe of stocks as well.\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"alert warning\">\n<b>Special

  used to be that a highly paid analyst formulated their fair value or target price,
  and the only way you could access their thought process was by paying thousands
  of dollars. Plus, why does an analyst cover a particular stock? How quickly do they
  update their model?\n\n![finbox - company view](//images.ctfassets.net/91sm3pewxzag/TaH0bakgO4km4Ys2ycyO2/357c88aa959edc1c10825afdd62f3a51/finbox_company-view.jpg?w=950)\n\nWe
  think **finbox.io is a great compliment to Sharesight** -- so be on the lookout
  for an [integration](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) and we’ll be tracking
  some of their favourite portfolios based on tried and true methodologies.\n\n###
