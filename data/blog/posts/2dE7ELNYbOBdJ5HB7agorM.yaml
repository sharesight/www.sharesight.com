:content: "Unlock the ultimate solution for investing, trading insights and performance
  tracking by connecting your [Marketech Focus](https://marketech.com.au/) account
  with Sharesight’s online portfolio tracker. Marketech’s connection to the [Sharesight
  API](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api) means that investors can automatically
  sync their Marketech trades to Sharesight, giving them access to the performance
  tracking and tax reporting features of Sharesight along with Marketech’s low-cost
  brokerage and trading insights. \n\n## What is Marketech Focus?\n\n[Marketech Focus](https://marketech.com.au/)
  is an online trading platform designed to provide market-leading trading tools and
  fairer fees to active ASX investors. Unlike traditional platforms where active investors
  can spend thousands of dollars each year on trading fees, Marketech’s pricing model
  rewards active traders with lower fees. Marketech also provides investors with real-time
  streaming pricing data via mobile and PC, plus information and trading tools that
  enable greater insight, control and transparency over trading decisions.\n\n## Why

  Sharesight create the ultimate connected infrastructure for ASX traders and investors.

  Marketech trades will be automatically synced to your Sharesight portfolio, giving
  you access to Sharesight’s performance tracking, [tax reporting](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/5-ways-sharesight-helps-australian-investors-at-tax-time/)
  and a range of powerful performance reports. For active investors, this means less
  time spent on portfolio and tax admin, and more time to focus on your trading strategy.

  account to Sharesight is easy. All you need to do is [sign up for Sharesight](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/signup),
